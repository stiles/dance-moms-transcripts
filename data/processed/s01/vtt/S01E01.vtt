Look at me.

00:00:03.536 --> 00:00:05.739 line:95%,end
Your mother is not your coach.

00:00:06.373 --> 00:00:07.474 line:95%,end
I am the coach.

00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:09.676 line:95%,end
Your mother doesn't
know what to do.

00:00:09.743 --> 00:00:11.411 line:95%,end
If she did,
she wouldn't bring you here.

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:14.280 line:95%,end
<i>Do you understand that?</i>

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:20.520 line:95%,end
(electric music playing)

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:23.323 line:95%,end
This is where it all starts.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.759 line:95%,end
We are preparing
for the National competition.

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:28.495 line:95%,end
<i>Moms come from all over</i>
<i>to bring their children to me.</i>

00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:30.330 line:95%,end
I can make you
or I can break you.

00:00:30.397 --> 00:00:32.532 line:95%,end
<i>They want to be a part</i>
<i>of the Abby Lee Dance Company.</i>

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.835 line:95%,end
What if she fell 13
stories down and died, huh?

00:00:35.902 --> 00:00:37.270 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Stop crying.
It's making it worse.

00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:38.905 line:95%,end
Nia.

00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:41.274 line:95%,end
I can't stand her!

00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:43.777 line:95%,end
ABBY: Go ask her nine-year-old if
she likes what she's wearing.

00:00:43.843 --> 00:00:45.678 line:95%,end
-I'm the mother!
-I'm an adult!

00:00:45.745 --> 00:00:48.081 line:95%,end
-Act like one!
-I need to go home.

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:49.816 line:95%,end
<i>Nobody lives here.</i>

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:51.651 line:95%,end
How many times
has my daughter beat your daughter?

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:53.887 line:95%,end
Melissa is sneaky
and she lies.

00:00:53.953 --> 00:00:56.423 line:95%,end
Christi is just jealous
of me and my daughter.

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.657 line:95%,end
I think they're both crazy.

00:00:57.724 --> 00:00:59.492 line:95%,end
-Because I did your makeup.
-I don't really care.

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.528 line:95%,end
You don't even look good
when you've got makeup on.

00:01:01.594 --> 00:01:03.396 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>I'm the teacher, I'm the mentor,</i>

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:04.364 line:95%,end
<i>I'm the professional.</i>

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:07.300 line:95%,end
If Vivi comes to me
and says that she

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:10.470 line:95%,end
wants to play softball,
I'll probably slit my wrists.

00:01:10.537 --> 00:01:12.872 line:95%,end
(dance music playing)

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:16.309 line:95%,end
SINGER:

00:01:16.376 --> 00:01:19.279 line:95%,end
<i>âªMy world is with my girlsâª</i>

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:21.548 line:95%,end
<i>âªLiving on the dance floorâª</i>

(tapping)

00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:33.693 line:95%,end
Hello.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.594 line:95%,end
Hi, Ab.

00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:36.663 line:5%,start
Today's the first day
of competition season.

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:37.864 line:95%,end
ABBY: How are you?

00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:39.866 line:95%,end
Kind of crazy in here today.

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:42.202 line:95%,end
-Hi!
-You look chipper this morning.

00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:44.337 line:95%,end
MELISSA:
<i>The kids are really, really excited.</i>

00:01:44.404 --> 00:01:45.638 line:95%,end
<i>I'm very excited too.</i>

00:01:45.705 --> 00:01:47.674 line:95%,end
I love competition time.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.442 line:95%,end
-ABBY: Ready to work?
-MELISSA: We're ready to work.

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:50.743 line:95%,end
-(indistinct)
-Okay.

00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:53.613 line:5%,start
(dramatic music playing)

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.649 line:5%,start
ABBY: I am the artistic director
and the chief choreographer

00:01:56.716 --> 00:01:59.085 line:95%,end
of the Abby Lee Dance
Company right here

00:01:59.152 --> 00:02:00.320 line:95%,end
in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:07.927 line:95%,end
Saute, coupe, chene, grand-jete.

00:02:07.994 --> 00:02:09.462 line:95%,end
People around
the country know me.

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:12.365 line:95%,end
They know Abby Lee
because I produce stars.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.337 line:95%,end
<i>I produce amazing,</i>
<i>employable dancers.</i>

00:02:17.403 --> 00:02:18.905 line:95%,end
<i>I know how to groom</i>
<i>these children</i>

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:21.341 line:95%,end
and raise these kids,
some of them

00:02:21.407 --> 00:02:22.475 line:95%,end
as if they were my old one.

00:02:22.542 --> 00:02:24.077 line:95%,end
One and up!

00:02:27.247 --> 00:02:28.081 line:95%,end
Okay, stop.

00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:31.117 line:95%,end
I've told you three
times in five minutes.

00:02:31.184 --> 00:02:32.285 line:95%,end
It's not a step-out.

00:02:32.352 --> 00:02:33.520 line:95%,end
It's a back handspring.

00:02:33.586 --> 00:02:34.454 line:95%,end
Two feet.

00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:35.522 line:95%,end
Do it right.

00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:37.624 line:95%,end
Start again. Suck it up.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:38.791 line:95%,end
I don't want to see those tears.

00:02:38.858 --> 00:02:41.161 line:95%,end
<i>I'm preparing them for a career.</i>

00:02:41.227 --> 00:02:43.396 line:95%,end
<i>We do it all in my studio.</i>

00:02:43.463 --> 00:02:46.633 line:95%,end
So that when they get to
real-life, they're ready.

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:48.001 line:95%,end
All right, girls.

00:02:48.067 --> 00:02:51.671 line:95%,end
It's the first day of rehearsal
for the new competition season.

00:02:51.738 --> 00:02:54.207 line:95%,end
Ladies, you all know
why you're here.

00:02:54.274 --> 00:02:56.643 line:95%,end
You are the cream
of the crop in your age group.

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.045 line:95%,end
And I have lots
of new ideas in store.

00:02:59.112 --> 00:03:02.615 line:95%,end
I am going to do something
that no other studio in the country does.

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:07.020 line:95%,end
Every single competition,
we are doing a new routine.

00:03:07.086 --> 00:03:10.590 line:95%,end
Uh-uh-uh-uh, girls, don't
look at your mothers.

00:03:10.657 --> 00:03:12.091 line:95%,end
I am the coach.

00:03:12.158 --> 00:03:13.193 line:95%,end
I am the teacher.

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:16.296 line:5%,start
Sometimes when Abby yells
it makes me laugh

00:03:16.362 --> 00:03:18.164 line:95%,end
because her face turns red.

00:03:18.231 --> 00:03:20.466 line:95%,end
I can make you
or I can break you.

00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:24.103 line:5%,start
KELLY: I mean, most dance studios
at least practice for six months

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.539 line:5%,start
before they go on stage
and perform their routines.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.575 line:95%,end
<i>I think it's crazy</i>

00:03:28.641 --> 00:03:31.611 line:95%,end
<i>that we're going to learn to dance</i>
<i>in a week and compete it.</i>

00:03:31.678 --> 00:03:34.681 line:95%,end
(tense music playing)

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.718 line:95%,end
ABBY:
<i>At the beginning of each week,</i>

00:03:38.785 --> 00:03:40.553 line:95%,end
I have kind of like
a pyramid thing

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.723 line:95%,end
where everybody's always trying
to get to the top of that.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.793 line:95%,end
<i>Everybody wants</i>
<i>to be on top, of course.</i>

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:48.027 line:95%,end
But you have to work for it.

00:03:48.094 --> 00:03:51.731 line:95%,end
It goes on behavior,
work ethic, attendance,

00:03:51.798 --> 00:03:55.268 line:95%,end
<i>as well as have they</i>
<i>followed all the rules.</i>


00:03:55.335 --> 00:03:58.071 line:95%,end
You know,
all of that goes into who's

00:03:58.137 --> 00:03:59.339 line:95%,end
going to be
at the top of the pyramid

00:03:59.405 --> 00:04:01.307 line:95%,end
<i>and who's going to get</i>
<i>to compete the next weekend.</i>

00:04:01.374 --> 00:04:03.243 line:95%,end
Everybody wants
to be front and center.

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:04.477 line:95%,end
I hear it all the time.

00:04:04.544 --> 00:04:06.379 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>She puts these</i>
<i>kids in a pyramid. It's a nightmare.</i>

00:04:06.446 --> 00:04:08.681 line:95%,end
It is a nightmare
for a child and an adult

00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:09.983 line:95%,end
because we have
to stand by and take it.

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.318 line:95%,end
ABBY: And you know what?
Whoever is in the front and center.

00:04:12.385 --> 00:04:14.220 line:95%,end
They can't make a mistake.

00:04:14.287 --> 00:04:15.655 line:95%,end
They are holding
that group together.

00:04:15.722 --> 00:04:17.457 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>Everybody always</i>
<i>wants to be on the top.</i>

00:04:17.523 --> 00:04:19.859 line:95%,end
Usually, if you're on
the top of the pyramid,

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:21.227 line:95%,end
you're in the front line.

00:04:21.294 --> 00:04:26.266 line:95%,end
So at the top right here
I have Maddie because she

00:04:26.332 --> 00:04:30.837 line:95%,end
is dedicated and because
of her stellar record last year.

00:04:30.903 --> 00:04:33.706 line:5%,start
HOLLY: And Maddie's on the top
and Nia's on the bottom.

00:04:33.773 --> 00:04:35.675 line:5%,start
And I'm a little
crushed for Nia.

00:04:35.742 --> 00:04:38.244 line:95%,end
ABBY: Maddie, are you
ready to be front and center?

00:04:38.311 --> 00:04:39.812 line:95%,end
Can you handle that pressure?

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:41.614 line:95%,end
MELISSA:
<i>I always feel bad because my daughter</i>

00:04:41.681 --> 00:04:43.216 line:5%,start
seems to always get on the top.

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:45.418 line:95%,end
And the girls just, you know,
they don't really like it.

00:04:45.485 --> 00:04:47.053 line:95%,end
The moms hate it.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.122 line:95%,end
ABBY: Our first competition,
it's going to be

00:04:49.188 --> 00:04:50.957 line:95%,end
in Phoenix, Arizona.

00:04:51.024 --> 00:04:53.793 line:95%,end
Ladies, I chose Phoenix, Arizona

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.963 line:95%,end
because I want you to experience
some of the best

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.032 line:95%,end
competition teams in the country.

00:04:59.098 --> 00:05:01.834 line:95%,end
We are going to do
two new numbers.

00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:04.904 line:95%,end
A high-energy, really cute,
adorable routine

00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:08.174 line:95%,end
with Maddie, Chloe,
Paige, Brooke, and Nia.

00:05:09.042 --> 00:05:13.112 line:95%,end
And then also a trio with Maddie,

00:05:13.179 --> 00:05:15.214 line:95%,end
Chloe, and Paige.

00:05:15.281 --> 00:05:17.917 line:95%,end
Unfortunately, Mackenzie,
you're too young to compete

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:19.519 line:95%,end
at West Coast Dance Explosion.

00:05:19.585 --> 00:05:21.754 line:95%,end
But you're still going
to go with us anyway.

00:05:22.288 --> 00:05:24.557 line:95%,end
Girls, we are going
to win in Phoenix.

00:05:24.624 --> 00:05:26.125 line:95%,end
And the next competition
we're going to win.

00:05:26.192 --> 00:05:27.660 line:95%,end
And the next competition
we're going to win.

00:05:27.727 --> 00:05:30.463 line:95%,end
And that's all gearing
up for nationals.

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.133 line:95%,end
Everything we do from this point
forward, all this training,

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.569 line:95%,end
all this competing
is about the Nationals.

00:05:36.636 --> 00:05:37.904 line:95%,end
So let's get to it.

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:39.339 line:95%,end
We are going to begin
the choreography.

00:05:39.405 --> 00:05:41.274 line:5%,start
Moms, you can be dismissed.

00:05:41.808 --> 00:05:44.110 line:5%,start
And, girls,
let's go to Nationals

00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:47.780 line:95%,end
and bring home
the winning trophy, all right?

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:51.117 line:95%,end
Oh, we're back
to dance jail up here.

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:52.552 line:95%,end
ABBY: Here's
what we're going to do.

00:05:52.618 --> 00:05:55.321 line:95%,end
I want each of you to do
either a chin stand

00:05:55.388 --> 00:05:57.023 line:95%,end
or like a side shoulder stand.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.926 line:95%,end
And we're going to hold
it for eight counts.

00:05:59.992 --> 00:06:01.260 line:95%,end
Let's do it from the top.

00:06:01.327 --> 00:06:04.364 line:5%,start
Ready and places.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:05.565 line:95%,end
Go.

00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:08.835 line:95%,end
<i>Party, Party, Party,</i>
<i>is a theatrical jazz routine.</i>

00:06:08.901 --> 00:06:11.804 line:95%,end
<i>It's upbeat,</i>
<i>it's fun, classic jazz.</i>

00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:13.639 line:95%,end
...two, three, four.

00:06:13.706 --> 00:06:15.675 line:95%,end
Hold, two, three, four.

00:06:15.742 --> 00:06:17.443 line:95%,end
Up and down.

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.612 line:95%,end
MELISSA: <i>Abby sometimes</i>
<i>has favorites in the studio</i>

00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:21.714 line:95%,end
<i>and my daughter just</i>
<i>happens to be a favorite.</i>

00:06:21.781 --> 00:06:23.950 line:5%,start
(dramatic music playing)

00:06:24.016 --> 00:06:25.818 line:95%,end
These are my two daughters,
Maddie and Mackenzie.

00:06:25.885 --> 00:06:27.620 line:95%,end
Maddie's 8 and Mackenzie's 6.

00:06:27.687 --> 00:06:29.722 line:95%,end
And they're both dancers.

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:31.190 line:95%,end
Did you have a nice day?

00:06:31.257 --> 00:06:33.726 line:95%,end
I definitely think my girls
are like little dolls.

00:06:33.793 --> 00:06:34.627 line:95%,end
<i>I love to dress them up.</i>

00:06:34.694 --> 00:06:35.895 line:95%,end
-There's you.
-MACKENZIE: There's me.

00:06:35.962 --> 00:06:37.597 line:95%,end
There's me. There's me.

00:06:37.663 --> 00:06:39.532 line:95%,end
My ex-to-be

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:42.402 line:95%,end

Because we're so dedicated to dance,
we have missed so much.

We had our awards ceremony.

For what?

-School.
-Oh, your grades. Okay.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:37.817 line:95%,end
I do find myself at times, you know,
putting dance before school.

00:08:37.884 --> 00:08:39.852 line:95%,end
And it's probably not right.

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:42.221 line:95%,end

Runner-up.

in her own backyard.

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:06.279 line:95%,end
Do you think you'll ever make
it to the top of the pyramid?

-We can hope, right?
-Yeah.

00:09:09.348 --> 00:09:11.417 line:95%,end
If she wants to be the best,
she has to beat the best.

00:09:11.484 --> 00:09:12.585 line:95%,end
And Maddie's the best.

00:09:12.652 --> 00:09:16.622 line:95%,end
Um, I'm not a big fan
of this new pyramid thing.

00:09:16.689 --> 00:09:19.358 line:95%,end
Because to me, that's more
like a Bermuda Triangle

00:09:19.425 --> 00:09:20.660 line:95%,end

Someone's at the top,
someone's at the bottom.

00:09:24.463 --> 00:09:26.165 line:95%,end
No teacher does
that in a classroom.

No.

00:09:29.769 --> 00:09:32.338 line:95%,end
So are we surprised who's
on the top of the pyramid?

-HOLLY: No.

-Mm-mm.

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:39.545 line:95%,end
I'm not surprised
she's at the top.

00:09:39.612 --> 00:09:41.948 line:95%,end
It's just,
it--because my kid is the star.

00:09:42.014 --> 00:09:43.983 line:95%,end

talented girl there.

Sharper, Paige. Hit, hit.

00:13:09.321 --> 00:13:11.490 line:95%,end
You're tall, you're skinny,
you're a beautiful girl.

00:13:11.557 --> 00:13:12.525 line:95%,end
You can do better than this.

00:13:12.591 --> 00:13:14.326 line:95%,end
Focus on your technique.

00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:18.464 line:95%,end
Shoulders down,
legs straight, feet pointed. Let's go.

ABBY: <i>People think I'm tough.</i>

00:13:22.067 --> 00:13:23.335 line:95%,end
<i>And I guess I am.</i>

00:13:23.402 --> 00:13:27.106 line:95%,end
But I'd rather be the one
that makes your child cry

00:13:27.173 --> 00:13:28.974 line:95%,end
in the privacy of my studio,

00:13:29.041 --> 00:13:32.812 line:95%,end
instead of crying in front of 800
people at an open audition.

00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:35.881 line:95%,end
Sloppy foot. You're right in the middle
of the stage, Paige.

distended neck, their turnout,
everything that's wrong

00:13:55.167 --> 00:13:57.203 line:95%,end
before somebody else
in the professional world

00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:58.170 line:95%,end
has to tell them.

00:13:58.237 --> 00:14:00.005 line:95%,end
Paige, come here.

00:14:00.072 --> 00:14:02.575 line:95%,end
I'd have your head
on a platter, yes?

00:14:02.641 --> 00:14:04.176 line:95%,end
Do you understand?
All right.

00:14:04.243 --> 00:14:05.444 line:95%,end
Man up. Get out there.

00:14:07.913 --> 00:14:09.215 line:95%,end
I correct them.

That's my job.

00:14:10.316 --> 00:14:12.084 line:95%,end
And sometimes that's offensive.

00:14:12.151 --> 00:14:14.119 line:95%,end
I think that's where
the tough comes in.

00:14:14.186 --> 00:14:15.421 line:95%,end
<i>But it's like tough love.</i>

00:14:15.487 --> 00:14:16.622 line:95%,end
Here's my baby.

Oh, don't cry angel.

-Ssh.

00:14:22.862 --> 00:14:24.363 line:95%,end
It's okay. Don't cry.

00:14:25.464 --> 00:14:26.599 line:95%,end
Don't worry about it.

00:14:26.665 --> 00:14:28.734 line:95%,end
Abby was yelling at me.

KELLY: These are my two daughters.

00:14:31.237 --> 00:14:32.104 line:95%,end
This is Paige.

00:14:32.171 --> 00:14:33.672 line:95%,end
She's 10 and Brooke is 13.

00:14:33.739 --> 00:14:34.573 line:95%,end
ABBY: Improv.

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:35.574 line:95%,end
One, two.

KELLY: <i>I'm very proud</i>

00:14:37.343 --> 00:14:39.979 line:95%,end
<i>Brooke has been winning awards</i>
<i>since she was six years old.</i>

00:14:40.045 --> 00:14:41.046 line:95%,end
<i>And Paige also.</i>

00:14:41.113 --> 00:14:43.849 line:95%,end
<i>Last year she won</i>
<i>first place for interview.</i>

00:14:43.916 --> 00:14:45.451 line:95%,end
I'm going to show
you guys something.

00:14:45.517 --> 00:14:48.888 line:95%,end
This is mommy when she
was your age, Brooke.

00:14:48.954 --> 00:14:50.656 line:95%,end
<i>I was a dancer when I was younger.</i>

00:14:50.723 --> 00:14:52.992 line:95%,end
<i>I have been with Abby</i>
<i>since I was two and 1/2.</i>

00:14:53.058 --> 00:14:55.327 line:95%,end
<i>I have danced</i>
<i>with her for 37 years.</i>

00:14:55.394 --> 00:14:58.998 line:95%,end
And I think that's
why when I had two girls,

00:14:59.064 --> 00:15:00.733 line:95%,end
I couldn't wait
for them to be dancers.

00:15:00.799 --> 00:15:03.369 line:95%,end
I want to try
competitive cheerleading.

00:15:03.435 --> 00:15:04.970 line:95%,end
Do you know how many
kids in your class

00:15:05.037 --> 00:15:08.173 line:95%,end
would like to be Junior
Miss Dance of Pennsylvania?

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:13.212 line:95%,end
I don't want Brooke to quit
dance because she's 13,

00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:16.782 line:95%,end
and that's when all
the trouble starts.

00:15:16.849 --> 00:15:19.351 line:95%,end
<i>I mean, when you were younger,</i>
<i>you used to get</i>

00:15:19.418 --> 00:15:21.020 line:95%,end
<i>first place all the time.</i>

00:15:21.086 --> 00:15:25.257 line:95%,end
Like, does it matter to
you that you're not getting

00:15:25.324 --> 00:15:26.792 line:95%,end
first and second anymore?

00:15:27.626 --> 00:15:28.861 line:95%,end
Not really.

00:15:30.729 --> 00:15:33.098 line:95%,end
I hope that my daughters
appreciate everything

00:15:33.165 --> 00:15:34.566 line:95%,end
I do for them for the dance.

00:15:34.633 --> 00:15:36.068 line:95%,end
I mean, I put a lot of time in it.

00:15:36.135 --> 00:15:38.704 line:95%,end
And a lot of times
they're mean to me

00:15:38.771 --> 00:15:40.606 line:95%,end
and don't show me
that they appreciate it.

00:15:40.673 --> 00:15:43.742 line:95%,end
But I think deep down inside
I know that they appreciate it.

00:15:43.809 --> 00:15:45.010 line:95%,end
That's her.

00:15:45.077 --> 00:15:46.912 line:95%,end
(chuckles) That's her.

00:15:46.979 --> 00:15:49.214 line:5%,start

I want nothing
but the best for her.

00:15:53.986 --> 00:15:57.122 line:5%,start
But I also know that Abby's
looking at last year's


00:15:57.189 --> 00:15:58.023 line:95%,end
track record.

00:15:58.090 --> 00:15:58.924 line:95%,end
Nia!

Close and taut arms!

HOLLY: <i>I do worry that Nia</i>

00:16:02.895 --> 00:16:04.096 line:95%,end
<i>won't have a fresh slate.</i>

00:16:04.163 --> 00:16:06.498 line:95%,end
New year, same old, same old.

00:16:08.267 --> 00:16:09.735 line:5%,start
Nia has a lot of confidence.

00:16:09.802 --> 00:16:12.171 line:95%,end
And I think Nia has
a lot of ability and talent.

00:16:12.237 --> 00:16:15.207 line:95%,end
My goal for Nia this year
is really for Nia to grow as a dancer.

00:16:15.274 --> 00:16:16.875 line:95%,end
Hi, Ab, this is Holly.

00:16:16.942 --> 00:16:18.844 line:95%,end
I went to Carnegie-Mellon
for my masters.

00:16:18.911 --> 00:16:20.846 line:95%,end
And I'm currently
at University of Pennsylvania.

00:16:20.913 --> 00:16:22.281 line:95%,end
And I'm also a principal.

00:16:22.348 --> 00:16:24.416 line:95%,end
People say I look
like Michelle Obama.

00:16:25.818 --> 00:16:27.519 line:95%,end
That's awesome to be
equated to the First Lady.

00:16:27.586 --> 00:16:29.054 line:95%,end
I'll take that
compliment any day.

00:16:29.121 --> 00:16:30.456 line:95%,end
Absolutely.

00:16:30.522 --> 00:16:33.926 line:95%,end
<i>I expect Nia this season</i>
<i>to have an amazing year in dance.</i>

00:16:33.993 --> 00:16:37.563 line:95%,end
Ideally, we would love
for her to have a title win.

00:16:37.629 --> 00:16:39.832 line:95%,end
This is my crown,
but I just bought it

00:16:39.898 --> 00:16:41.633 line:95%,end
because I had to have one.

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.569 line:95%,end
I haven't won one in dance.

00:16:43.635 --> 00:16:45.371 line:95%,end
You haven't won one yet,
but it's coming, right?

00:16:45.437 --> 00:16:46.438 line:95%,end
-Yeah.
-It's coming.

00:16:46.505 --> 00:16:50.809 line:95%,end
Nia is not a featured dancer
and that continues to be an issue.

00:16:50.876 --> 00:16:53.946 line:95%,end
And I don't want Nia
to always be the backup dancer.

00:16:54.013 --> 00:16:56.382 line:95%,end
ABBY: You're going over there.
It's forward!

00:16:56.448 --> 00:16:57.316 line:95%,end
HOLLY: <i>Abby can be tough.</i>

00:16:57.383 --> 00:16:59.284 line:95%,end
She knows her business
very, very well.

00:16:59.351 --> 00:17:02.521 line:95%,end
I think she produces excellent answers,
but she demands a lot.

00:17:02.588 --> 00:17:04.456 line:95%,end
-(sobbing)
-Okay.

00:17:04.523 --> 00:17:06.992 line:95%,end
Nia, Nia, Let me see you.

00:17:07.059 --> 00:17:09.528 line:95%,end
I am not a doormat and people
cannot walk over me

00:17:09.595 --> 00:17:11.363 line:95%,end
and they cannot walk over my child.

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:12.965 line:95%,end
<i>And that's where</i>
<i>we draw the line.</i>

00:17:13.032 --> 00:17:14.199 line:95%,end
Come on, give me a hug.

00:17:14.266 --> 00:17:15.367 line:95%,end
I love you.

00:17:15.434 --> 00:17:17.436 line:95%,end

-What's your name?
-Vivi.

00:17:30.649 --> 00:17:31.683 line:95%,end
Hi, Vivi.

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:34.420 line:95%,end
We want to sign up for classes
and we want to do competition.

00:17:36.755 --> 00:17:39.625 line:5%,start
Dance has been in my life since
I've been three years old.

My mom danced, my grandma danced,

00:17:43.462 --> 00:17:45.064 line:95%,end
so Vivi has to dance.

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:46.999 line:95%,end
I think you like dance?

Five, six, seven, eight.
Get it up.

Why do you keep forgetting this?

Ugh, ugh.

pink is not a color,

but it is a way of life.

00:18:22.301 --> 00:18:24.036 line:95%,end

00:19:16.388 --> 00:19:18.190 line:95%,end

you have no options.

00:19:18.257 --> 00:19:19.958 line:95%,end
I own Candy Apples Dance Center.

00:19:20.025 --> 00:19:22.694 line:5%,start
-Does that ring a bell?
-Oh, so you're the dance teacher.

00:19:22.761 --> 00:19:24.530 line:5%,start
-I am the dance teacher.
-I'm sorry.

00:19:24.596 --> 00:19:27.366 line:95%,end
-And this is your daughter?
-This is my daughter.

00:19:27.432 --> 00:19:28.800 line:95%,end
So you're here as the mom.

00:19:28.867 --> 00:19:29.935 line:95%,end
I am here as the mom.

00:19:30.002 --> 00:19:31.603 line:95%,end
-Not the dance teacher.
-No. I'm--

00:19:32.471 --> 00:19:33.472 line:95%,end
You're not looking for a job?

00:19:33.539 --> 00:19:35.841 line:95%,end
-Oh, no. Yet...
-Okay. Okay. All right.

00:19:35.908 --> 00:19:39.111 line:95%,end
We just wanted
to give her a boost.

00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:41.747 line:95%,end
I would like to see her compete

00:19:41.813 --> 00:19:43.782 line:95%,end
with you this weekend.

00:19:43.849 --> 00:19:44.783 line:95%,end
This weekend?

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:45.817 line:95%,end
This weekend.

00:19:45.884 --> 00:19:47.085 line:95%,end
Um, we can do it.

00:19:47.152 --> 00:19:48.854 line:95%,end
-We can do it.
-Can't we?

00:19:48.921 --> 00:19:51.456 line:95%,end
We--you go, girlfriend.
We can do it.

00:19:51.523 --> 00:19:53.025 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>Mom's come from all over</i>

00:19:54.326 --> 00:19:56.595 line:95%,end

00:19:56.662 --> 00:19:58.230 line:95%,end
They come for me.

00:19:58.297 --> 00:19:59.898 line:95%,end
You want to do tricks first?

00:19:59.965 --> 00:20:01.333 line:95%,end
You want to lay on
your tummy and show me

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.568 line:95%,end
touch your future head?

00:20:03.335 --> 00:20:05.437 line:95%,end
CATHY: <i>I see Vivi having</i>

00:20:05.504 --> 00:20:06.471 line:95%,end
some talent.

00:20:06.538 --> 00:20:08.974 line:95%,end
<i>And she's extremely flexible.</i>

00:20:09.041 --> 00:20:11.210 line:95%,end
<i>She's got a beautiful point.</i>

00:20:11.276 --> 00:20:13.111 line:95%,end
I'm hoping she
has a dancer's body.

00:20:13.178 --> 00:20:14.913 line:95%,end
ABBY: How about your front limber?


00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:16.882 line:95%,end
-Uh.
-ABBY: Handstand?

00:20:16.949 --> 00:20:18.884 line:95%,end
-To a backbend?
-No.

00:20:18.951 --> 00:20:20.018 line:95%,end
No?

00:20:20.085 --> 00:20:22.354 line:95%,end
CATHY: We actually prepared
a little piece for you to see.

00:20:22.421 --> 00:20:24.423 line:95%,end
It's just a little duo
that we started this year,

00:20:24.489 --> 00:20:26.158 line:95%,end
but she'll just do
it as a solo for you.

00:20:26.225 --> 00:20:27.292 line:95%,end
-Is that okay?
-Okay, that's--

00:20:27.359 --> 00:20:28.193 line:95%,end
you want to do that?

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:29.328 line:95%,end
(dance music playing)

00:20:29.394 --> 00:20:30.862 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>Cathy came into my studio</i>

00:20:30.929 --> 00:20:32.731 line:95%,end
<i>and her daughter Vivi auditioned.</i>

00:20:32.798 --> 00:20:34.199 line:95%,end
<i>I thought it was ridiculous.</i>

00:20:34.266 --> 00:20:37.669 line:95%,end
She demanded that she be in
this competition this weekend.

00:20:37.736 --> 00:20:39.071 line:95%,end
<i>That's not realistic.</i>

00:20:39.137 --> 00:20:42.441 line:95%,end
There is no way Vivian
is ready to compete this weekend.

00:20:42.507 --> 00:20:45.277 line:95%,end
<i>I need to work with her</i>
<i>a lot more before she's ready.</i>

00:20:45.344 --> 00:20:46.578 line:95%,end
Here's the thing.

00:20:46.645 --> 00:20:48.380 line:95%,end
And you know this from
having your own school.

00:20:48.447 --> 00:20:49.514 line:95%,end
-CATHY: Yes.
-I have people

00:20:49.581 --> 00:20:51.250 line:95%,end
that want to be in the Dance Company

00:20:51.316 --> 00:20:52.651 line:95%,end
just to get the outfit.

00:20:52.718 --> 00:20:56.154 line:95%,end
The money doesn't matter,
here's my kid, do whatever you want.

00:20:56.221 --> 00:20:58.857 line:95%,end
I need mom to step
out of the picture.

00:20:58.924 --> 00:21:00.692 line:95%,end
So I'm going to be
the teacher, all right?

00:21:00.759 --> 00:21:02.327 line:95%,end
You're going to look at me.

00:21:02.394 --> 00:21:04.630 line:95%,end
Maybe it's just time
for me to be the mom

00:21:04.696 --> 00:21:06.565 line:95%,end
and for somebody
else to be the coach.

00:21:06.632 --> 00:21:08.066 line:95%,end
ABBY: Mom,
I'll take you out front

00:21:08.133 --> 00:21:10.102 line:95%,end

-Okay. Oh.

00:21:10.168 --> 00:21:11.770 line:95%,end
ABBY: And you're
sure we're good on this?

00:21:11.837 --> 00:21:13.138 line:95%,end
We're going to get signed up?

00:21:13.205 --> 00:21:15.207 line:95%,end
-Yeah.
-What do you say?

00:21:15.274 --> 00:21:16.775 line:95%,end
Go give her a big hug.

CATHY: <i>I think that Abby is the one that's</i>

00:21:18.577 --> 00:21:21.013 line:95%,end

me and Vivi being a packaged deal.

00:21:23.282 --> 00:21:27.152 line:95%,end
<i>So I may be just able</i>

-All right?
-Okay.

00:21:30.555 --> 00:21:31.723 line:95%,end
-Thank you.
-I'll see you soon, Vivi.

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:33.659 line:95%,end
I'm going to be able
to bring things to the table.

00:21:37.362 --> 00:21:39.131 line:5%,start
A five, six, seven, eight.

00:21:39.197 --> 00:21:40.499 line:5%,start
And one and two.

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.468 line:95%,end
Five, six, seven, eight.
And One--

00:21:43.535 --> 00:21:45.537 line:95%,end
Make sure that you're
supporting foot is turning out.

00:21:45.604 --> 00:21:46.538 line:95%,end
I want everyone to watch.

I don't care if you're taping.

No, I'm in rehearsal.

You don't throw my

single kid out here, Abby.

They all look like children!

Isn't that crazy,
that children look like children?

She's dressed appropriately.

00:22:35.954 --> 00:22:37.322 line:95%,end
You're a minister.
Act like one.

Yes, I am a minister!

00:22:39.257 --> 00:22:41.927 line:95%,end
Let's play the Bible game, Abby.

00:22:41.993 --> 00:22:46.665 line:95%,end
When Jesus saw things that
were wrong, he went after it!

00:22:46.732 --> 00:22:49.801 line:95%,end
And I'll tell you what,
you're not going to do this to my kid!

00:22:49.868 --> 00:22:51.303 line:95%,end
Out of the room.
Out.

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:53.171 line:95%,end
Out.
Regan? Goodbye.

Out.
Out.

Yes.

Every week we put the trash out.

00:23:00.946 --> 00:23:02.481 line:95%,end
Go.

00:23:02.547 --> 00:23:05.283 line:95%,end
Then take yourself out
because you're the biggest

piece of trash there is!

ABBY: You cannot take
acrobatic class in socks.

I told you the clothes to take
are your two-piece costume.

There's a big difference.

00:23:15.494 --> 00:23:17.596 line:95%,end
How can you remember that,
and you can't remember

00:23:17.662 --> 00:23:19.765 line:95%,end
to turn your feet out, huh?

00:23:19.831 --> 00:23:20.899 line:95%,end
That's pathetic.

00:23:20.966 --> 00:23:22.234 line:95%,end
Go somewhere else.

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:24.669 line:95%,end
Take your money, take
your kid, take your socks.

00:23:24.736 --> 00:23:25.737 line:95%,end
Find another school.

00:23:25.804 --> 00:23:29.741 line:95%,end
Does it not hit in your
head that maybe you're wrong.

00:23:29.808 --> 00:23:31.343 line:95%,end
-No.
-Do you not get it?

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:33.211 line:95%,end
I don't get it.
I know I'm right.

-My name is on the front of it.
-So what!

00:23:37.682 --> 00:23:40.252 line:95%,end
You keep telling her
how stupid she is.

00:23:40.318 --> 00:23:42.788 line:95%,end
ABBY: She's not stupid.
She just can't read.

00:23:42.854 --> 00:23:43.855 line:95%,end
You know--

fall far from the tree.

00:23:47.292 --> 00:23:49.227 line:95%,end
So you're saying I'm stupid?

00:23:49.294 --> 00:23:50.295 line:95%,end
Well, are you?

00:23:50.362 --> 00:23:51.463 line:95%,end
(screams) (indistinct)

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:54.199 line:95%,end
I've got more education
than you will ever have.

00:23:54.266 --> 00:23:58.069 line:95%,end
Than you will ever have
because I went to school.

00:23:58.136 --> 00:23:59.604 line:95%,end
Unfortunately, you didn't.

00:23:59.671 --> 00:24:00.806 line:95%,end
May I have your phone?

Call the police!

Go for it!

There's a psycho
in every batch.

00:24:07.179 --> 00:24:08.213 line:95%,end
A psycho.

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.282 line:95%,end
Yes, her name's Abigail Miller.

Hi, I need an--
a police at 7123 Saltsburg.

Are you okay, Dawn?

00:24:17.289 --> 00:24:18.924 line:95%,end
No, no, no.

00:24:19.925 --> 00:24:21.159 line:95%,end
Are you okay?

00:24:21.226 --> 00:24:23.762 line:95%,end
-No, I'm not!
-Ssh.

00:24:24.596 --> 00:24:27.532 line:95%,end
I have a--
a parent that's out of control.

00:24:27.599 --> 00:24:29.668 line:95%,end
I can't stand her.

(dramatic music playing)

00:24:33.305 --> 00:24:34.172 line:5%,start
Call the police!

Go for it!

Dawn came into
the studio screaming.

00:24:38.376 --> 00:24:40.245 line:95%,end
She just was going
from room to room.

00:24:40.312 --> 00:24:41.346 line:95%,end
Pardon?

00:24:42.814 --> 00:24:44.149 line:95%,end
She does not have weapons.

00:24:44.216 --> 00:24:45.383 line:95%,end
Just her mouth.

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:47.185 line:95%,end
She was just at the brink.

00:24:48.019 --> 00:24:49.120 line:95%,end
I don't know
if she went outside.

00:24:49.187 --> 00:24:50.455 line:95%,end
I walked into a room.

00:24:50.522 --> 00:24:52.591 line:95%,end
My senior company
is warming up in another room

00:24:52.657 --> 00:24:53.892 line:95%,end

See you (indistinct)

Let's go, guys.
Let's get in the other room.

00:25:00.866 --> 00:25:02.133 line:95%,end
Thank you.

Oh, my God!

00:30:54.719 --> 00:30:57.222 line:95%,end
She walked right into
the curling iron.

00:30:57.288 --> 00:30:58.623 line:95%,end
Oh, Paige.

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:00.625 line:95%,end

She walked into

Look.

00:31:12.136 --> 00:31:13.938 line:95%,end
When we were cleaning
up for the competition,

00:31:14.005 --> 00:31:15.740 line:95%,end
I was putting away
my curling iron

00:31:15.807 --> 00:31:17.775 line:95%,end
and I was wrapping up the cord.

00:31:17.842 --> 00:31:21.579 line:95%,end
And I don't know if I turned
or Paige bent down.

00:31:21.646 --> 00:31:24.616 line:95%,end
Somehow my curling
iron burnt Paige on the arm.

00:31:24.682 --> 00:31:25.550 line:95%,end
Here's some ice.

00:31:25.617 --> 00:31:27.018 line:95%,end
And here, use this.

00:31:28.286 --> 00:31:29.220 line:95%,end

KELLY: It really got her good.

00:31:39.297 --> 00:31:41.165 line:95%,end
It did really get it good.

It's okay.

You're going to live.

I think it made Paige
feel a lot better.

00:31:46.437 --> 00:31:47.772 line:95%,end
I feel so bad.

00:31:47.839 --> 00:31:49.240 line:95%,end
Hey Paige...

00:31:49.307 --> 00:31:50.508 line:95%,end
Hey Paige...

00:31:50.575 --> 00:31:51.609 line:95%,end
Where's my--

00:31:51.676 --> 00:31:52.744 line:95%,end
if it makes you feel
better.

00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:54.078 line:95%,end

00:32:05.657 --> 00:32:07.525 line:5%,start
I have a trio

00:32:18.536 --> 00:32:19.437 line:5%,start
See those girls down there?

00:32:19.504 --> 00:32:21.239 line:95%,end
Look at those girls
with the legs?

00:32:21.306 --> 00:32:22.407 line:95%,end
You're going to be against them.

00:32:22.473 --> 00:32:23.608 line:95%,end
So you need to step it up.

00:32:23.675 --> 00:32:25.376 line:95%,end
<i>We're getting ready</i>
<i>for the group dance</i>

00:32:25.443 --> 00:32:27.478 line:95%,end
<i>and I am under a lot of stress.</i>

00:32:27.545 --> 00:32:30.815 line:95%,end
For parents, this is
an after-school activity.

00:32:30.882 --> 00:32:32.850 line:95%,end
For me, it is my livelihood.

00:32:32.917 --> 00:32:33.785 line:95%,end
Is it in?

00:32:33.851 --> 00:32:36.554 line:95%,end
If it's not in, when you're
ready to go on that stage,

00:32:36.621 --> 00:32:37.922 line:95%,end
you tell Linda
Diamond or somebody

00:32:37.989 --> 00:32:39.490 line:95%,end
backstage that you
need a bobby pin.

00:32:39.557 --> 00:32:41.326 line:95%,end
And they'll give you one.
Do you understand me?

00:32:41.392 --> 00:32:43.962 line:95%,end
Open your mouth and ask
somebody if you need something

00:32:44.028 --> 00:32:44.896 line:95%,end
backstage.

00:32:44.963 --> 00:32:46.197 line:95%,end
Chances are they
have it laying--

00:32:46.264 --> 00:32:48.032 line:95%,end
or there's probably 10 bobby
pins laying on the floor.

00:32:48.099 --> 00:32:51.002 line:95%,end
It fell out when she did
her side aerial, it went down.

00:32:51.069 --> 00:32:52.637 line:95%,end
I know. But that's dangerous.

00:32:52.704 --> 00:32:54.706 line:95%,end
What if she was at
Radio City Music Hall?

00:32:54.772 --> 00:32:56.774 line:95%,end
And the thing was open
for the ice skating rink to come out,

00:32:56.841 --> 00:32:59.310 line:95%,end
and she did a side aerial
and fell 13 stories down

00:32:59.377 --> 00:33:01.045 line:95%,end
and died, huh?

00:33:01.112 --> 00:33:02.513 line:95%,end
Let's go girls.

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:06.718 line:95%,end
I may be perceived as a little edgy
in my teaching methods.

00:33:06.784 --> 00:33:09.087 line:95%,end
<i>However, when you walk into my classroom,</i>

00:33:09.153 --> 00:33:10.688 line:95%,end
<i>it's a professional environment.</i>

00:33:10.755 --> 00:33:12.423 line:95%,end
And I'm going to give it to you straight

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:14.559 line:95%,end
just like you're going to
get it in the real world.

00:33:14.625 --> 00:33:16.227 line:95%,end
Pay attention to me, yes?

00:33:16.627 --> 00:33:17.462 line:95%,end
Yes?

00:33:17.528 --> 00:33:20.665 line:95%,end
So turn so tight, right around yourself,
and get down there.

00:33:21.165 --> 00:33:23.668 line:5%,start
The one person that
can mess us up backstage is Abby

00:33:23.735 --> 00:33:26.637 line:5%,start
because she just always comes back
and like frustrates us.

00:33:26.704 --> 00:33:28.239 line:95%,end
She's like don't forget your dances!

00:33:28.306 --> 00:33:29.874 line:95%,end
Straighten your legs,
point your feet, and you'll be fine.

00:33:29.941 --> 00:33:31.876 line:95%,end
<i>And so it kind of makes us really nervous.</i>

00:33:31.943 --> 00:33:34.579 line:95%,end
And so we don't really like
her being backstage with us.

00:33:34.645 --> 00:33:36.714 line:95%,end
