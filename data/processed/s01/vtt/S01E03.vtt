(tense music playing)

00:00:01.935 --> 00:00:03.470 line:5%,start
Where's the rest of her costume?

00:00:04.204 --> 00:00:06.639 line:5%,start
That was over the top,
inappropriate

00:00:06.706 --> 00:00:08.508 line:5%,start
for a little girl, smacking her butt.

00:00:08.575 --> 00:00:10.043 line:5%,start
You know, maybe
you should not come.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.611 line:5%,start
<i>When a parent opens their mouth,</i>

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:13.980 line:5%,start
they are ruining their child.

00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:14.881 line:5%,start
I'm bus sick.

00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:18.118 line:5%,start
MELISSA: I'm not sure Cathy
will ever fit in with these moms.

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:20.787 line:5%,start
My daughter is supposed
to be doing her solo this weekend.

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:22.389 line:5%,start
Why isn't she working with my kid?

00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:24.557 line:5%,start
No matter how successful Chloe is,

00:00:24.624 --> 00:00:27.460 line:5%,start
she's never successful
enough in Abby's eyes.

00:00:28.728 --> 00:00:29.696 line:5%,start
(tense music playing)

00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:32.032 line:5%,start
-MELISSA: Happy birthday!
-KELLY: Where did you get that?

00:00:32.098 --> 00:00:33.033 line:5%,start
Oh, my god!

00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:35.101 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: <i>Melissa is very good</i>
<i>at making friends,</i>

00:00:35.168 --> 00:00:37.504 line:5%,start
<i>then using them for personal gain.</i>

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.440 line:5%,start
Vivi-Anne, you're going to do
a solo in the competition

00:00:40.507 --> 00:00:41.741 line:5%,start
this weekend.

00:00:41.808 --> 00:00:45.612 line:5%,start
Vivi was uncomfortable
with the solo that we worked on,

00:00:45.678 --> 00:00:47.847 line:5%,start
so we are going to go ahead and do

00:00:47.914 --> 00:00:49.482 line:5%,start
a piece that she already knows.

00:00:50.283 --> 00:00:52.786 line:5%,start
KELLY: <i>Brooke's hip's</i>
<i>been bothering her all week,</i>

00:00:52.852 --> 00:00:55.355 line:5%,start
<i>so I decided to take her</i>
<i>to Dr. Vitale.</i>

00:00:55.422 --> 00:00:57.490 line:5%,start
I really don't think that
it's a good thing for her

00:00:57.557 --> 00:00:59.159 line:5%,start
to be competing today
or this weekend.

00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:04.197 line:95%,end
(theme music playing)

00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:05.665 line:95%,end
SINGER: <i>âª Get up âª</i>

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:07.634 line:95%,end
<i>âª Get on the floor âª</i>

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.703 line:95%,end
<i>âª My world is with my girls âª</i>

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.073 line:95%,end
<i>âª Living on the dance floor âª</i>

00:01:13.807 --> 00:01:16.810 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:25.118 line:95%,end
You're an intermediate advanced tap class.

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:27.720 line:95%,end
ABBY: Let's go, girls! Come on!

00:01:27.787 --> 00:01:28.788 line:95%,end
Come on.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.826 line:95%,end
Vivi-Anne,
where's your dance clothes?

00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:35.495 line:95%,end
It's in the car.

00:01:35.562 --> 00:01:37.363 line:95%,end
You need to be dressed
and ready to dance

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.365 line:95%,end
when you walk in this building. Yes?

00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:42.469 line:95%,end
I want to recap a little bit
about the competition.

00:01:42.535 --> 00:01:44.671 line:95%,end
Now there are some things
that went on

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:46.239 line:95%,end
that maybe you don't even know about.

00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:48.675 line:95%,end
Your mom was upset
about the costume.

00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:51.144 line:95%,end
Your mom was upset about the costume
before you went onstage.

00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:53.913 line:95%,end
HOLLY: That was over the top
and appropriate for little girls,

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.648 line:95%,end
<i>on stage gyrating.</i>

00:01:56.182 --> 00:01:57.984 line:95%,end
When they went down
and opened their legs,

00:01:58.051 --> 00:01:59.252 line:95%,end
<i>I--I almost walked out the door.</i>

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:00.553 line:95%,end
But that cannot happen again.

00:02:01.654 --> 00:02:03.289 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>We all know why</i>
<i>we lost last week.</i>

00:02:03.356 --> 00:02:06.259 line:5%,start
It was a hideous, trashy costumes.

00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:07.994 line:5%,start
But Abby's never going
to take the blame.

00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:09.429 line:5%,start
She's going to blame us dance moms.

00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:11.865 line:5%,start
Let's talk about
what we're going to do this weekend.

00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:15.068 line:5%,start
We're going to New Jersey
and we are going to do

00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:17.036 line:5%,start
an acrobatic gymnastic routine.

00:02:17.103 --> 00:02:19.239 line:5%,start
Acrobatics is an art form.

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:22.642 line:5%,start
It uses the flexibility
of the legs and the back

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.679 line:5%,start
to execute slow,
controlled movement.

00:02:26.746 --> 00:02:29.916 line:95%,end
Overall, I evaluated
all of your performances.

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:32.819 line:95%,end
So, Maddie, you won that competition
and the title.

00:02:32.886 --> 00:02:35.121 line:95%,end
I'm going to leave you
right where you were. Yes?

00:02:35.188 --> 00:02:38.424 line:95%,end
Maddie is at the top of the pyramid
for her performance

00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:43.129 line:95%,end
and her scoring and her overall behavior
last weekend.

00:02:43.196 --> 00:02:47.267 line:95%,end
However, I chose to do
an acrobatic routine this weekend,

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:49.836 line:95%,end
so I need to pull in my--

00:02:49.903 --> 00:02:53.339 line:95%,end
my ringer and use Brooke,
because she's amazing.

00:02:53.406 --> 00:02:56.176 line:95%,end
Brooke, I expect you
to help the younger students

00:02:56.242 --> 00:02:58.244 line:95%,end
and I expect you to know
the choreography first

00:02:58.311 --> 00:02:59.712 line:95%,end
and be able to help everybody else.

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:01.814 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>I am shocked</i>
<i>where Brooke's placed.</i>

00:03:01.881 --> 00:03:03.383 line:95%,end
Both of my girls
are pretty good at acro,

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:06.085 line:95%,end
<i>so why wasn't Brooke on the top?</i>

00:03:06.152 --> 00:03:07.053 line:95%,end
All right.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.988 line:95%,end
Nia, Paige,

00:03:09.055 --> 00:03:11.324 line:95%,end
you'll be doing the tumbling part
and the acro part.

00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:14.327 line:95%,end
HOLLY: <i>Abby says she assigns</i>
<i>based on last week's performance.</i>

00:03:14.394 --> 00:03:16.296 line:5%,start
But, to be honest,
I think the pyramid's

00:03:16.362 --> 00:03:17.630 line:5%,start
really not going to change, at all.

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:19.632 line:95%,end
<i>I think Maddie will be at the top</i>

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:22.602 line:95%,end
<i>and Nia will always be</i>
<i>at the bottom of the pyramid.</i>

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:25.004 line:95%,end
Vivi-Anne, because you're new here

00:03:25.071 --> 00:03:27.273 line:95%,end
and you don't really know
all of our terminology,

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.642 line:95%,end
I'm going to work privately with you
this week.

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.745 line:95%,end
And so you're going to do a solo
at the competition this weekend.

00:03:32.812 --> 00:03:34.080 line:95%,end
CHRISTI:
<i>This is the greatest thing</i>

00:03:34.147 --> 00:03:37.383 line:95%,end
<i>because I Vivi to do</i>
<i>the competition,</i>

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.886 line:5%,start
the title winning, I want it to be me.

00:03:39.953 --> 00:03:42.222 line:5%,start
I want her to dance
and be just like I was.

00:03:42.288 --> 00:03:43.990 line:95%,end
All right, girls. Let's go. Get up.

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:46.693 line:95%,end
Get ready to rehearse.
Moms, thank you very much.

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:48.962 line:95%,end
Vivi, don't forget,
you need to be in dance clothes

00:03:49.028 --> 00:03:51.030 line:95%,end
whenever you walk in this room,
ready to go.

00:03:51.097 --> 00:03:52.098 line:95%,end
All right.

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:56.502 line:5%,start
One, two, three, four,

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.672 line:5%,start
five, six, seven, eight.

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:00.873 line:95%,end
One, two...

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.210 line:95%,end
Acrobatic routines
take a lot longer to perfect.

00:04:04.277 --> 00:04:05.612 line:95%,end
You have to build up the stamina.

00:04:05.678 --> 00:04:07.547 line:95%,end
<i>So we need to work really hard.</i>

00:04:07.614 --> 00:04:10.950 line:95%,end
I need to know what it's going to take
to get my daughter

00:04:11.017 --> 00:04:12.752 line:95%,end
moved up on this pyramid.

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.454 line:95%,end
<i>Why is Maddie at the top?</i>

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.356 line:95%,end
She actually pyramids the kids

00:04:16.422 --> 00:04:17.457 line:95%,end
-and puts them in...
-Yes.

00:04:17.523 --> 00:04:20.960 line:95%,end
Okay, so Vivi was sucking hind (bleep).

00:04:21.027 --> 00:04:22.929 line:95%,end
And I didn't expect her to be on top.

00:04:22.996 --> 00:04:24.797 line:95%,end
I think there are lots of ways
she can give out assignments

00:04:24.864 --> 00:04:26.499 line:95%,end
where you do not have
to put people in pyramids.

00:04:26.566 --> 00:04:27.867 line:95%,end
To pyramid them--absolutely.

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:29.002 line:95%,end
I mean, this is not the Egyptian era.

00:04:29.068 --> 00:04:31.671 line:95%,end
Just being the new person coming in,

00:04:31.738 --> 00:04:33.773 line:95%,end
then why do you guys put up with this?

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.041 line:95%,end
She's the best choreographer.

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:36.876 line:95%,end
She just basically says
she doesn't want to hear anything

00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:38.778 line:95%,end
from anybody else (indistinct)
she's pulling for the dance.

00:04:38.845 --> 00:04:40.713 line:95%,end
That's what really
Abby doesn't understand,

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.549 line:95%,end
because she is missing
the mother gene. She's not...

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:45.952 line:95%,end
Well, and you know,
I used to hear that all the time

00:04:48.021 --> 00:04:51.157 line:95%,end
being on the other side of the fence
and being the dance teacher.

00:04:51.224 --> 00:04:53.926 line:95%,end
And I know that, you know,
you guys are the dance moms.


00:04:53.993 --> 00:04:55.895 line:95%,end
But at my dance studio,

00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:57.964 line:95%,end
what I get sick and tired of people doing

00:04:58.031 --> 00:04:59.499 line:95%,end
is trying to second guess me.

00:04:59.565 --> 00:05:01.367 line:95%,end
But the dance teacher
does have to have a plan.

00:05:01.434 --> 00:05:04.404 line:95%,end
And sometimes
she can't convey it to you.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.739 line:95%,end
She just can't do it
at--at a drop of a hat.

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:08.374 line:95%,end
Ugh, Cathy.

00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:09.909 line:95%,end
I don't know Cathy
is going to make it in our group.

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:12.045 line:95%,end
<i>Okay. I don't want to be</i>
<i>a dance teacher</i>

00:05:12.111 --> 00:05:13.946 line:95%,end
<i>then keep your deal studio</i>
<i>and train her yourself.</i>

00:05:14.013 --> 00:05:15.815 line:95%,end
<i>If you want to bring her</i>
<i>to somebody else,</i>

00:05:15.882 --> 00:05:17.817 line:95%,end
then you sit upstairs
like the rest of the mothers.

00:05:17.884 --> 00:05:20.520 line:95%,end
Did you ever tell anyone
that you would only have a child

00:05:20.586 --> 00:05:22.622 line:95%,end
if you could keep it in a fish tank
and sprinkle in some fish food?

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:24.724 line:95%,end
CATHY: No. But I must tell you
that I used to say that

00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:26.459 line:95%,end
a good thing would be kennel for kids.

00:05:26.526 --> 00:05:27.960 line:95%,end
(laughter)

00:05:28.027 --> 00:05:29.896 line:95%,end
Just tuck and roll again.

00:05:29.962 --> 00:05:31.130 line:95%,end
Put your knees together.

00:05:31.597 --> 00:05:33.466 line:95%,end
Now, for the next part,

00:05:33.533 --> 00:05:35.401 line:95%,end
roll upstage to me.

00:05:35.468 --> 00:05:37.437 line:95%,end
Lower the elbow,

00:05:37.503 --> 00:05:38.971 line:95%,end
back attitude,

00:05:39.739 --> 00:05:41.407 line:95%,end
arm, pretty.

00:05:41.474 --> 00:05:43.910 line:95%,end
-Happy birthday!
-CATHY: Where did you get that?

00:05:43.976 --> 00:05:45.278 line:95%,end
Oh, my god!

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:46.746 line:95%,end
MELISSA:
<i>I knew it was Cathy's birthday,</i>

00:05:46.813 --> 00:05:48.781 line:95%,end
<i>so I wanted to do</i>
<i>something special for her.</i>

00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:50.616 line:95%,end
<i>It's really hard to trust people</i>
<i>at the studio,</i>

00:05:50.683 --> 00:05:53.453 line:95%,end
<i>so I think bonding with Cathy</i>
<i>is very important.</i>

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:56.189 line:95%,end
She seems like a very sweet person
and very genuine person,

00:05:56.255 --> 00:05:57.490 line:95%,end
and that's how I am.

00:05:59.058 --> 00:06:00.827 line:95%,end
(cheering)

00:06:00.893 --> 00:06:02.829 line:95%,end
CATHY: That is so nice.

00:06:02.895 --> 00:06:04.597 line:95%,end
Thank you.

00:06:04.664 --> 00:06:06.566 line:95%,end
Ooh-la-la.

00:06:06.632 --> 00:06:09.102 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>Melissa being friends with Cathy</i>
<i>doesn't surprise me, at all.</i>

00:06:09.168 --> 00:06:12.171 line:95%,end
Melissa always becomes friends

00:06:12.238 --> 00:06:13.906 line:95%,end
with the new people in the studio.

00:06:13.973 --> 00:06:14.874 line:95%,end
Who wants cake?

00:06:14.941 --> 00:06:15.975 line:95%,end
-Can we cut the cake?
-MELISSA: Sure.

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:17.744 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>I think she has a hard time</i>
<i>keeping friends</i>

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.345 line:95%,end
<i>-because people see through her.</i>
-HOLLY: Delicious.

00:06:19.412 --> 00:06:20.646 line:95%,end
-Would you like an end?
-CATHY: I want the end.

00:06:20.713 --> 00:06:22.148 line:95%,end
-Okay.
-CHRISTI: <i>She is very good</i>

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:25.385 line:95%,end
<i>at making friends,</i>
<i>then using them for personal gain.</i>

00:06:25.451 --> 00:06:27.954 line:95%,end
That's just how Melissa rolls.

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.123 line:95%,end
SINGER:<i> âª All the frowns âª</i>

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:32.425 line:95%,end
<i>âª And the ups and the downs âª</i>

00:06:32.492 --> 00:06:37.363 line:95%,end
<i>âª It's like I have no other way âª</i>

00:06:38.297 --> 00:06:39.499 line:95%,end
This is an acro dance.

00:06:39.565 --> 00:06:42.168 line:95%,end
Everybody knows
that's Brooke's fortÃ©.

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:44.537 line:95%,end
-HOLLY: Absolutely.
-KELLY: Brooke should be front and center.

00:06:44.604 --> 00:06:46.739 line:95%,end
Maddie's not front center in this dance.

00:06:46.806 --> 00:06:48.074 line:95%,end
She's in the second row.

00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:50.042 line:95%,end
-Oh, but she's at the top of the pyramid.
-I know.

00:06:50.109 --> 00:06:52.812 line:95%,end
It has nothing to do with the acro dance,
I guarantee it.

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:55.214 line:95%,end
I don't know.
I'm going to go ask her.

00:06:55.281 --> 00:06:56.449 line:95%,end
Go ahead.

00:06:56.516 --> 00:06:58.017 line:95%,end
I mean, I don't know what else to do.

00:06:58.084 --> 00:07:00.253 line:5%,start
Confronting Abby is very difficult.

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:01.754 line:5%,start
I've been doing it for years,

00:07:01.821 --> 00:07:03.956 line:5%,start
ever since I was one of her students,

00:07:04.023 --> 00:07:05.458 line:5%,start
and I still get a little scared.

00:07:05.925 --> 00:07:07.126 line:95%,end
-Wish me luck, ladies.
-Good luck.

00:07:07.193 --> 00:07:08.661 line:95%,end
Good luck with that.

00:07:08.728 --> 00:07:11.030 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>If you're in the bottom line</i>
<i>of the pyramid,</i>

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:13.199 line:95%,end
<i>I think Abby's trying</i>
<i>to tell you something.</i>

00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:15.535 line:95%,end
<i>And, you know,</i>
<i>Brooke's not Abby's favorite anymore,</i>

00:07:15.601 --> 00:07:17.837 line:95%,end
<i>so she's just like--she'll punish her.</i>

00:07:17.904 --> 00:07:19.172 line:95%,end
HOLLY: You can do it, Kelly.

00:07:19.238 --> 00:07:21.240 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I don't think that has anything
to do with the acro dance.

00:07:21.307 --> 00:07:22.308 line:95%,end
ABBY: Ready?

00:07:23.709 --> 00:07:24.677 line:95%,end
-KELLY: Abby.
-ABBY: Yes?

00:07:24.744 --> 00:07:26.679 line:95%,end
-KELLY: I think we need to talk.
-ABBY: Watch your step. What?

00:07:26.746 --> 00:07:28.848 line:95%,end
What's the problem with us?

00:07:28.915 --> 00:07:29.982 line:95%,end
She's in the acro dance.

00:07:30.049 --> 00:07:33.119 line:95%,end
She's not at the top of the pyramid
for the week of an acro dance?

00:07:33.186 --> 00:07:35.388 line:95%,end
It's just because she's always brooding
and miserable.

00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:37.223 line:95%,end
That's not the Brooke I know.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:41.494 line:95%,end
Brooke is kind of going through
that junior high business

00:07:41.561 --> 00:07:43.029 line:95%,end
that they all go through.

00:07:43.095 --> 00:07:46.265 line:95%,end
And she really is
an amazing acrobat,

00:07:46.332 --> 00:07:48.301 line:95%,end
and I don't want her to lose that
or give that up.

00:07:48.367 --> 00:07:50.269 line:95%,end
She's at the bottom
of the pyramid, Abby.

00:07:50.336 --> 00:07:53.539 line:95%,end
You--you mean to tell me
Chloe is above her

00:07:53.606 --> 00:07:54.974 line:95%,end
in the pyramid in the gymnastics?

00:07:55.041 --> 00:07:57.443 line:95%,end
I mean, when does Brooke go on stage
and not pull it off?

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:58.778 line:95%,end
She always--she...

00:07:58.845 --> 00:08:00.246 line:95%,end
-(laughs)
-She always does, Abby.

00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:01.948 line:95%,end
We'll look at the video
of the tap dance.

00:08:02.014 --> 00:08:03.349 line:95%,end
Well, she's not a tapper.

00:08:03.416 --> 00:08:04.884 line:95%,end
-ABBY: Yeah, I know.
-But an acro dance?

00:08:04.951 --> 00:08:06.752 line:95%,end
<i>Brooke used to be Abby's favorite.</i>

00:08:06.819 --> 00:08:09.255 line:95%,end
She had her front and center
in every number,

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:12.158 line:95%,end
had her having 900 privates every week.

00:08:12.225 --> 00:08:13.659 line:95%,end
<i>And I think Abby burns you out.</i>

00:08:13.726 --> 00:08:16.929 line:95%,end
The Brooke you know is now a teenager
and is changing.

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:18.898 line:95%,end
Well, you need to nip in the bud

00:08:18.965 --> 00:08:20.366 line:95%,end
because you don't want her to change.

00:08:20.433 --> 00:08:22.568 line:95%,end
-I don't use...
-Maybe she wants to do teenage things.

00:08:22.635 --> 00:08:24.103 line:95%,end
I don't think it's that easy.

00:08:25.071 --> 00:08:28.207 line:95%,end
I've seen changes already,
and it saddens me, Kelly. And you know...

00:08:28.274 --> 00:08:30.109 line:95%,end
What, am I going to force her
to come to class?

00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:33.946 line:95%,end
Yes. it's really hard
to get through to them and say,

00:08:34.013 --> 00:08:35.615 line:95%,end
but you have this gift.

00:08:35.681 --> 00:08:36.949 line:95%,end
<i>Don't throw it all away.</i>

00:08:37.016 --> 00:08:38.317 line:95%,end
I know you're very happy with your life.

00:08:38.384 --> 00:08:39.719 line:95%,end
You have a wonderful house.

00:08:39.785 --> 00:08:42.054 line:95%,end
You have a wonderful husband.
You got a nice guy.

00:08:42.121 --> 00:08:44.257 line:95%,end
But, Kelly,
think of what you could have been.

00:08:44.323 --> 00:08:45.558 line:95%,end
You settled!

00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:48.294 line:95%,end
You settled, and you're letting your kids
like the same thing!

00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:51.197 line:95%,end
If my mom would have told me
I had to come to dance class,

00:08:51.264 --> 00:08:52.331 line:95%,end
I would have rebelled against it.

00:08:52.398 --> 00:08:54.300 line:95%,end
When Kelly was my student,

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:57.370 line:95%,end
she was gorgeous
and worked really hard

00:08:57.436 --> 00:09:01.407 line:95%,end
and was very dedicated
up until about 12 or 13.

00:09:01.474 --> 00:09:03.276 line:95%,end
And now the same thing's happening
with Brooke.

00:09:03.342 --> 00:09:05.444 line:95%,end
-Like mother, like daughter.
-I mean, they're kids, Abby.

00:09:05.511 --> 00:09:07.813 line:95%,end
I know, but she's not.
She's 13 years old.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.682 line:95%,end
Cheerleading--all of her friends
from school cheer.

00:09:09.749 --> 00:09:11.951 line:95%,end
So I think that's why Brooke wants to--

00:09:12.018 --> 00:09:13.753 line:95%,end
So you're going to send her
to cheerleading, so she can shake

00:09:13.819 --> 00:09:16.355 line:95%,end
her poms poms for some boy
to go to college for free?

00:09:16.422 --> 00:09:18.424 line:95%,end
<i>Brooke wants to be</i>
<i>a professional performer.</i>

00:09:18.491 --> 00:09:19.792 line:95%,end
<i>But the last time I checked,</i>

00:09:19.859 --> 00:09:22.028 line:95%,end
Cirque du Soliel
doesn't hire cheerleaders.

00:09:22.094 --> 00:09:23.863 line:95%,end
Let's go. Let's get back to work!

00:09:24.997 --> 00:09:26.265 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>Abby's crazy.</i>

00:09:26.332 --> 00:09:28.935 line:95%,end
I don't think Abby's ever forgiven me
for quitting dance.

00:09:29.001 --> 00:09:30.469 line:95%,end
You know, I've moved on.

00:09:30.536 --> 00:09:32.705 line:95%,end
I have a life. I have a family now.

00:09:32.772 --> 00:09:36.108 line:95%,end
And at the end of the day,
all Abby has is an empty studio.

00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:38.911 line:95%,end
I don't know. No matter what I said,
I wasn't getting ahead.

00:09:38.978 --> 00:09:40.146 line:95%,end
Like, that's not fair.

00:09:40.212 --> 00:09:41.581 line:95%,end
ABBY:
Open it up. Come down here.

00:09:41.647 --> 00:09:42.748 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>It's the acro number.</i>

00:09:42.815 --> 00:09:43.916 line:95%,end
<i>Brooke should be featured,</i>

00:09:43.983 --> 00:09:45.818 line:95%,end
whether she wants to come
to dance or not.


00:09:47.887 --> 00:09:50.256 line:5%,start
(dramatic music playing)

00:09:50.323 --> 00:09:52.325 line:5%,start
KELLY: Girls, let's go!

00:09:52.391 --> 00:09:54.660 line:5%,start
What time is it? It's 4 o'clock.
We have to be there at 4:30,

00:09:54.727 --> 00:09:56.562 line:5%,start
and it takes us 20 minutes to get there.
We got to go.

00:09:56.629 --> 00:09:59.565 line:5%,start
BROOKE: I feel like I'm,
like, dancing too much

00:09:59.632 --> 00:10:02.034 line:5%,start
just because, like, I never have time
to like hang out with my friends.

00:10:02.101 --> 00:10:03.569 line:5%,start
Because they're always inviting me
to do stuff

00:10:03.636 --> 00:10:05.338 line:95%,end
but I can never do it
because of dance.

00:10:05.404 --> 00:10:07.373 line:95%,end
KELLY: Let's go, Brooke!

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.943 line:95%,end
BROOKE: And I feel like my mom,
like, really wants me to dance

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:12.845 line:95%,end
just because, like,
she doesn't want me to, like,

00:10:12.912 --> 00:10:15.881 line:95%,end
screw up and quit dance
and be a cheerleader like she did.

00:10:15.948 --> 00:10:17.350 line:95%,end
KELLY: Brooke!

00:10:17.416 --> 00:10:18.351 line:95%,end
BROOKE: What?

00:10:18.417 --> 00:10:19.719 line:95%,end
I am leaving!

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.321 line:95%,end
I don't want to go!

00:10:22.388 --> 00:10:23.723 line:95%,end
KELLY: Too bad!

00:10:23.789 --> 00:10:27.126 line:5%,start
I'm concerned Brooke's going to quit dance
like I did when I was little.

00:10:27.193 --> 00:10:30.129 line:5%,start
And I really don't want her
to make the same mistakes I made.

00:10:30.196 --> 00:10:32.465 line:95%,end
Brooke, I'm leaving without you!

00:10:33.366 --> 00:10:34.800 line:95%,end
I don't care!

00:10:36.969 --> 00:10:38.237 line:95%,end
Why don't you want to go?

00:10:39.005 --> 00:10:40.506 line:95%,end
Because.

00:10:40.573 --> 00:10:41.741 line:95%,end
Because why?

00:10:41.807 --> 00:10:43.075 line:95%,end
It's boring.

00:10:43.976 --> 00:10:46.479 line:95%,end
Brooke reminds me a lot of myself
when I was her age.

00:10:47.079 --> 00:10:50.116 line:95%,end
Kacey and Claudia
asked me to go to the mall,

00:10:50.182 --> 00:10:53.419 line:95%,end
but I can't go
because I have dance like always.

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:58.090 line:95%,end
Do you think they became Junior Miss Dance
from going to the mall?

00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:00.226 line:95%,end
No. They're cheerleaders.

00:11:00.292 --> 00:11:02.862 line:95%,end
I tried to explain to her,
when I quit dance,

00:11:02.928 --> 00:11:05.531 line:95%,end
you know, alls I did
was go out with my friends

00:11:05.598 --> 00:11:06.799 line:95%,end
and we went to the mall.

00:11:06.866 --> 00:11:08.467 line:95%,end
And, like, I got nothing out of it.

00:11:08.534 --> 00:11:10.736 line:95%,end
Let's not go to the competition.

00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:14.073 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>I was talented,</i>
<i>but I just didn't want</i>

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:17.943 line:95%,end
to be as dedicated to it
as Abby wanted me to.

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:20.179 line:95%,end
You committed to it. You have to go.

00:11:20.246 --> 00:11:21.414 line:95%,end
So let's go.

00:11:22.648 --> 00:11:23.949 line:95%,end
<i>I think it's just the age.</i>

00:11:24.016 --> 00:11:24.950 line:95%,end
I think it's a teenager.

00:11:25.985 --> 00:11:28.621 line:95%,end
<i>I think once she gets over</i>
<i>the hump of realizing</i>

00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:30.923 line:95%,end
<i>there's nothing else really</i>
<i>that exciting out there,</i>

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:32.391 line:95%,end
I think she'll be fine.

00:11:35.795 --> 00:11:36.896 line:95%,end
ABBY: Hello.

00:11:36.962 --> 00:11:38.097 line:95%,end
CATHY: Hi, Abby.

00:11:38.164 --> 00:11:40.366 line:5%,start
ABBY: How are you?
Are you ready to work?

00:11:40.433 --> 00:11:41.333 line:5%,start
-Uh-huh.
-Okay.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.436 line:5%,start
<i>When Vivi-Anne came to work</i>
<i>on her solo,</i>

00:11:43.502 --> 00:11:45.438 line:5%,start
her mother, Cathy, dropped her off

00:11:45.504 --> 00:11:47.873 line:5%,start
because she was going
to have lunch with Melissa.

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:50.843 line:5%,start
And I was thrilled to get rid of Cathy
for the hour and a half.

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:52.344 line:95%,end
-All right.
-Okay. I'll talk to you later.

00:11:52.411 --> 00:11:54.013 line:95%,end
-Bye, honey!
-ABBY: Okay. Thanks, Cath. Have fun.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.749 line:95%,end
<i>Vivi is cute.</i>
<i>She's a nice little girl.</i>

00:11:56.816 --> 00:11:59.351 line:95%,end
<i>But she's not at the level</i>
<i>that Cathy thinks she is.</i>

00:11:59.418 --> 00:12:02.054 line:95%,end
I don't know if privates with me
are really what she needs.

00:12:02.121 --> 00:12:04.990 line:95%,end
But, hey, if the checks clear,
let's do it.

00:12:05.925 --> 00:12:06.826 line:95%,end
Good.

00:12:06.892 --> 00:12:09.095 line:95%,end
ChassÃ©, sautÃ©.

00:12:11.163 --> 00:12:14.834 line:95%,end
ChassÃ©, knee, knee,
one more, four.

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.136 line:95%,end
Vivi is not strong in acrobatics.

00:12:17.203 --> 00:12:19.171 line:95%,end
To the right. To the right.
To the right.

00:12:19.238 --> 00:12:21.507 line:95%,end
<i>Her jumps, her leaps are not as strong.</i>

00:12:21.574 --> 00:12:23.709 line:95%,end
<i>And she hasn't learned</i>
<i>a lot of the things.</i>

00:12:23.776 --> 00:12:27.179 line:95%,end
Step right, kick left.

00:12:27.246 --> 00:12:28.380 line:95%,end
Start over.

00:12:28.447 --> 00:12:31.183 line:95%,end
<i>She's dancing at a five,</i>
<i>six-year-old level</i>

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:32.752 line:95%,end
<i>instead of a seven, eight, nine.</i>

00:12:32.818 --> 00:12:34.253 line:95%,end
Vivi needs to step it up.

00:12:35.187 --> 00:12:36.889 line:95%,end
You have to keep her knees together.

00:12:36.956 --> 00:12:39.625 line:95%,end
She just needs to be in class
day after day after day.

00:12:39.692 --> 00:12:41.560 line:95%,end
<i>Once she's with the dance company,</i>

00:12:41.627 --> 00:12:43.229 line:95%,end
<i>she's going to be more independent.</i>

00:12:43.295 --> 00:12:45.531 line:95%,end
And now we'll see
if Cathy can handle that.

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:47.266 line:95%,end
All right.
Let's take it from the top, kid.

00:12:49.835 --> 00:12:51.737 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:12:51.804 --> 00:12:54.373 line:95%,end
CATHY: <i>I decided to invite Melissa</i>
<i>to lunch today.</i>

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.408 line:95%,end
<i>Information is power.</i>

00:12:56.475 --> 00:12:59.278 line:95%,end
<i>And I think if Melissa</i>
<i>wants to be my friend,</i>

00:12:59.345 --> 00:13:02.381 line:95%,end
then I can get some very useful dirt

00:13:02.448 --> 00:13:04.116 line:95%,end
about the other dance moms.

00:13:04.183 --> 00:13:06.085 line:95%,end
Now do you know
the other husbands,

00:13:06.152 --> 00:13:08.387 line:95%,end
-like Christi's husband and...
-Yes.

00:13:08.454 --> 00:13:09.822 line:95%,end
What do they do professionally?

00:13:09.889 --> 00:13:13.125 line:95%,end
Kelly's husband,
he works for a family business.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:15.628 line:95%,end
And then what about
Christi's husband?

00:13:15.694 --> 00:13:17.630 line:95%,end
Christi's husband works
for Children's Hospital.

00:13:17.696 --> 00:13:19.098 line:95%,end
-Oh, really?
-Yeah. He's like, a...

00:13:19.165 --> 00:13:20.432 line:95%,end
-Is he a doctor?
-No.

00:13:20.499 --> 00:13:21.834 line:95%,end
-He's a writer.
-Oh.

00:13:21.901 --> 00:13:22.768 line:95%,end
I'm not really sure.

00:13:22.835 --> 00:13:24.970 line:95%,end
And then what about Holly's husband?
What does he do?

00:13:25.037 --> 00:13:26.806 line:95%,end
MELISSA:
He just got a new job.

00:13:26.872 --> 00:13:29.875 line:95%,end
He was working in, like,
non-profit organizations.

00:13:30.776 --> 00:13:32.144 line:95%,end
Okay.

00:13:32.745 --> 00:13:35.014 line:95%,end
So what does your husband do?


00:13:38.584 --> 00:13:42.721 line:95%,end
I'm--I'm going through
a divorce right now, so I'm not...

00:13:42.788 --> 00:13:44.657 line:95%,end
-Oh.
-MELISSA: Yeah.

00:13:44.723 --> 00:13:45.724 line:95%,end
CATHY: Yeah.

00:13:46.192 --> 00:13:48.027 line:95%,end
The girls are okay with the divorce?

00:13:49.562 --> 00:13:50.596 line:95%,end
Mm-hmm.

00:13:50.663 --> 00:13:52.431 line:95%,end
Melissa did not tell me
that she was living

00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:56.168 line:95%,end
with another man who was paying
for her daughter's dance lessons.

00:13:56.235 --> 00:13:59.305 line:95%,end
I got that from the other moms,
so I already knew that.

00:13:59.371 --> 00:14:03.075 line:95%,end
It doesn't seem, Melissa, like,
you're like really, really, really close

00:14:03.142 --> 00:14:05.110 line:95%,end
-with some of those other moms.
-No.

00:14:06.512 --> 00:14:08.247 line:95%,end
You can't trust anybody.

00:14:08.314 --> 00:14:12.451 line:95%,end
CATHY: <i>Melissa's in charge</i>
<i>of scheduling private lessons,</i>

00:14:12.518 --> 00:14:14.720 line:95%,end
<i>so I may need a favor</i>
<i>from time to time.</i>

00:14:15.287 --> 00:14:18.157 line:95%,end
I told her if she needed
to talk about anything

00:14:18.224 --> 00:14:20.626 line:95%,end
that she could definitely come
and confide to me.

00:14:20.693 --> 00:14:22.628 line:95%,end
But I'm busy.
I'm not going through a divorce.

00:14:22.695 --> 00:14:25.397 line:95%,end
-I have a new BFF.
-I think so, too! (laughs)

00:14:25.464 --> 00:14:27.533 line:95%,end
CATHY: <i>I feel sorry for people</i>
<i>that are going through divorces,</i>

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:28.968 line:95%,end
but I'm happy with my life.

00:14:29.034 --> 00:14:31.003 line:95%,end
-Thank you. It was wonderful.
-Thank you.

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:32.438 line:95%,end
-We'll be back.
-We'll be back.

00:14:32.504 --> 00:14:33.539 line:5%,start
(upbeat music playing)

00:14:33.606 --> 00:14:35.908 line:5%,start
ABBY: Girls, does anyone know
where Paige and Brooke are?

00:14:35.975 --> 00:14:37.042 line:95%,end
Why are they late?

00:14:37.109 --> 00:14:39.245 line:95%,end
This acrobatic routine
is just not coming along

00:14:39.311 --> 00:14:40.946 line:95%,end
as quickly as I would like.

00:14:41.013 --> 00:14:42.681 line:95%,end
They need to start picking it up.

00:14:43.382 --> 00:14:44.817 line:95%,end
KELLY: All right, let's go. Hurry up.

00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:46.018 line:95%,end
ABBY: Up straight.

00:14:46.085 --> 00:14:46.986 line:95%,end
Too fast, Maddie.

00:14:51.991 --> 00:14:53.826 line:95%,end
All right, go back. You guys are late.

00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:56.362 line:95%,end
You two go up there and warm up.
Watch what we've done so far.

00:14:56.428 --> 00:14:57.696 line:95%,end
Because I did a whole bunch

00:14:57.763 --> 00:14:59.531 line:95%,end
So what, did Brooke come home
and didn't want to come?

00:15:00.666 --> 00:15:03.969 line:95%,end
Yeah. She didn't want to come
because it's a break at school

00:15:04.036 --> 00:15:05.971 line:95%,end
and her friends are all going to the mall.

00:15:06.038 --> 00:15:08.507 line:95%,end
-It's hard to beat 13.
-Exactly.

00:15:08.574 --> 00:15:10.976 line:95%,end
How do you tell her, oh,
you can't go to the mall with your friends

00:15:11.043 --> 00:15:12.411 line:95%,end
-because dance is mandatory.
-You have to go dance

00:15:12.478 --> 00:15:13.879 line:95%,end
-with your little sister.
-Yeah.

00:15:13.946 --> 00:15:16.949 line:95%,end
(dramatic music playing)

00:15:18.617 --> 00:15:21.353 line:95%,end
Nia, arms come over your head, straight.

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:23.088 line:95%,end
You keep bringing them up out here.

00:15:23.989 --> 00:15:26.759 line:95%,end
You need to run further downstage.
Get up there.

00:15:30.029 --> 00:15:32.831 line:95%,end
Melissa and Cathy
went to lunch today.

00:15:32.898 --> 00:15:34.199 line:95%,end
They went to lunch?

00:15:34.266 --> 00:15:36.035 line:95%,end
Well, how about her bringing
in the birthday cake?

00:15:36.735 --> 00:15:38.137 line:95%,end
-KELLY: And a present.
-I know. (laughs)

00:15:38.203 --> 00:15:39.038 line:95%,end
KELLY: A present.

00:15:39.638 --> 00:15:42.708 line:95%,end
Meanwhile, I had a baby,
like, a baby.

00:15:42.775 --> 00:15:45.878 line:95%,end
And she didn't even give me a card,
so you know much she likes me.

00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:47.713 line:95%,end
Hello.

00:15:48.347 --> 00:15:50.349 line:95%,end
KELLY: Miss Holly,
you're here early.

00:15:50.416 --> 00:15:51.383 line:95%,end
-I am.
-CHRISTI: Hello!

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:54.353 line:95%,end
ABBY: A six and a seven and a eight!

00:15:55.554 --> 00:15:56.722 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Hi, girls.

00:15:57.723 --> 00:15:59.992 line:95%,end
-HOLLY: Hi. How are you?
-I'm good. How are you?

00:16:00.059 --> 00:16:01.193 line:95%,end
HOLLY: I'm fine.

00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:04.863 line:95%,end
I went to lunch today with Cathy.

00:16:05.397 --> 00:16:06.598 line:95%,end
Did you?

00:16:06.665 --> 00:16:08.434 line:95%,end
She's funny.

00:16:10.436 --> 00:16:13.305 line:5%,start
KELLY: I like Melissa a lot,
but I don't trust her.

00:16:13.372 --> 00:16:14.974 line:95%,end
So what did Cathy have to say?

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.442 line:95%,end
Does she like it here?

00:16:16.508 --> 00:16:18.077 line:95%,end
We really didn't talk about
that--that much

00:16:18.143 --> 00:16:19.678 line:95%,end
but she did say
that it's very unorganized.

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.382 line:95%,end
I've caught her a lot of times
lying to me.

00:16:23.949 --> 00:16:26.652 line:95%,end
It's hard to call somebody
that lies to you a friend.

00:16:26.719 --> 00:16:29.121 line:95%,end
But their studio is very competitive.

00:16:29.188 --> 00:16:31.357 line:95%,end
They're competitive against one another.

00:16:31.423 --> 00:16:33.025 line:95%,end
Not only the kids but more the parents?

00:16:33.092 --> 00:16:34.460 line:95%,end
Yeah.

00:16:34.526 --> 00:16:35.861 line:95%,end
HOLLY: That's a surprise.

00:16:35.928 --> 00:16:38.197 line:95%,end
So what did you have to say about me?

00:16:39.198 --> 00:16:40.165 line:95%,end
Nothing.

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.435 line:95%,end
She talked about your husbands.

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:46.739 line:95%,end
You talked about my husband?

00:16:48.707 --> 00:16:49.808 line:95%,end
All of them.

00:16:50.676 --> 00:16:51.844 line:95%,end
Really?

00:16:52.411 --> 00:16:55.014 line:95%,end
-So what the hell did you talk about?
-Yeah. What did you talk about?

00:16:55.481 --> 00:16:57.216 line:95%,end
She just asked about the husbands.

00:16:59.018 --> 00:17:01.186 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>First of all,</i>
<i>you don't really even know my husband.</i>

00:17:01.253 --> 00:17:04.156 line:5%,start
Second, why aren't you telling her
about your situation?

00:17:04.223 --> 00:17:05.858 line:5%,start
Because you're the one
in the middle of a divorce.

00:17:06.925 --> 00:17:08.994 line:95%,end
-KELLY: Does she know you're separated?
-Yeah.

00:17:09.061 --> 00:17:10.662 line:95%,end
I'm not talking about it, though.

00:17:10.729 --> 00:17:13.198 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>I don't understand why</i>
<i>Melissa even brought that up.</i>

00:17:13.265 --> 00:17:15.401 line:95%,end
<i>Oh, by the way, Cathy was asking</i>
<i>about your husband.</i>

00:17:15.467 --> 00:17:16.502 line:95%,end
It just seemed weird.

00:17:17.136 --> 00:17:19.338 line:95%,end
I really--we had a good time.
It was nice.

00:17:19.405 --> 00:17:21.673 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>If you're going to gossip</i>
<i>about anybody's home situation</i>

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:23.976 line:95%,end
and their men,
you need to talk about yourself.


00:17:27.746 --> 00:17:29.848 line:5%,start
(upbeat music playing)

00:17:29.915 --> 00:17:31.750 line:5%,start
ABBY: All right.
Whenever you're near a big city,

00:17:31.817 --> 00:17:34.653 line:5%,start
New York City, New Jersey,
the kids are going to be amazing.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.189 line:5%,start
Got it? So give me a high five.

00:17:37.256 --> 00:17:39.725 line:95%,end
Brooke, stop looking at your mother.

00:17:39.792 --> 00:17:41.894 line:95%,end
I am the coach. Look at this.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.162 line:95%,end
Your knees, bent.

00:17:43.228 --> 00:17:44.730 line:95%,end
Your supporting foot's not turned out.

00:17:44.797 --> 00:17:47.299 line:95%,end
<i>We have two days</i>
<i>before the Starbound competition</i>

00:17:47.366 --> 00:17:48.467 line:95%,end
<i>in New Jersey.</i>

00:17:48.534 --> 00:17:50.969 line:95%,end
<i>And my lead</i>
<i>in the acrobatic routine, Brooke,</i>

00:17:51.036 --> 00:17:54.406 line:95%,end
<i>is dragging her feet</i>
<i>and slowing all the production down.</i>

00:17:54.473 --> 00:17:57.443 line:95%,end
Let's go, girls. Did you come here
to dance or to play? Come on.

00:17:59.445 --> 00:18:01.814 line:5%,start
Brooke really is an amazing acrobat,

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:04.083 line:5%,start
and I don't want her to lose that
or give that up.

00:18:04.149 --> 00:18:07.352 line:5%,start
So I wanted to do a number
where the other children,

00:18:07.419 --> 00:18:10.622 line:95%,end
<i>who are quite a bit younger,</i>
<i>could have a role model of follow.</i>

00:18:10.689 --> 00:18:11.757 line:95%,end
Ready?

00:18:11.824 --> 00:18:15.427 line:95%,end
Girls, she gets her ankle, ankle, go.

00:18:21.033 --> 00:18:22.868 line:95%,end
I think that Brooke--

00:18:22.935 --> 00:18:24.870 line:95%,end
one of the reasons why
she doesn't want to come

00:18:24.937 --> 00:18:28.273 line:95%,end
is because with her dancing
with kids this young,

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:29.975 line:95%,end
like, especially in gymnastics,

00:18:30.042 --> 00:18:31.477 line:95%,end
she's more advanced.

00:18:31.543 --> 00:18:32.811 line:95%,end
-Yeah.
-I mean, even her doing her--

00:18:32.878 --> 00:18:36.048 line:95%,end
that solo part in there,
it just seems like...

00:18:37.216 --> 00:18:38.350 line:95%,end
she's bored.

00:18:38.417 --> 00:18:41.286 line:95%,end
(dramatic music playing)

00:18:41.353 --> 00:18:43.355 line:95%,end
To the floor.
To the floor, Brooke.

00:18:43.422 --> 00:18:45.190 line:95%,end
To the floor.

00:18:50.129 --> 00:18:51.396 line:95%,end
You were on the wrong foot.

00:18:51.463 --> 00:18:53.699 line:95%,end
Uh, Brooke.
What's taking so long?

00:18:54.466 --> 00:18:57.002 line:95%,end
BROOKE: Well, my hip hurts.

00:18:57.069 --> 00:18:59.838 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>Brooke must have injured her hips</i>
<i>several weeks ago,</i>

00:18:59.905 --> 00:19:03.108 line:95%,end
and it's now inflamed

00:19:03.175 --> 00:19:05.978 line:95%,end
and it's bothering her because
we're doing all these new routines.

00:19:06.044 --> 00:19:07.513 line:95%,end
I have to figure this out.

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:10.215 line:95%,end
My hip is hurting.

00:19:10.282 --> 00:19:11.316 line:95%,end
What?

00:19:11.383 --> 00:19:12.484 line:95%,end
My hip still hurts.

00:19:12.551 --> 00:19:13.852 line:95%,end
Okay. Do you want me to see

00:19:13.919 --> 00:19:15.988 line:95%,end
if I can take you to the chiropractor,
real quick?

00:19:16.054 --> 00:19:16.889 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: What's the matter?

00:19:16.955 --> 00:19:19.558 line:95%,end
Her hip and her ankle and--

00:19:19.925 --> 00:19:21.226 line:95%,end
she's falling apart.

00:19:21.293 --> 00:19:22.227 line:95%,end
It's that old age.

00:19:22.294 --> 00:19:23.729 line:95%,end
I was just going to say, you turn 13

00:19:23.795 --> 00:19:25.497 line:95%,end
-and you're no good anymore.
-You're falling apart.

00:19:25.564 --> 00:19:27.032 line:95%,end
<i>It's common for a dancer</i>

00:19:27.099 --> 00:19:28.433 line:95%,end
<i>to dance through an injury.</i>

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:29.535 line:95%,end
When I was a dancer,

I always had complications.

00:19:32.171 --> 00:19:34.173 line:95%,end
You know, you always had injuries.

00:19:34.239 --> 00:19:36.241 line:95%,end
Either it was a sprained ankle

00:19:36.308 --> 00:19:38.010 line:95%,end
or a pulled muscle,

00:19:38.076 --> 00:19:39.344 line:95%,end
and you just had to work through it.

00:19:39.411 --> 00:19:42.581 line:95%,end
(indistinct chatter)

00:19:42.648 --> 00:19:44.349 line:95%,end

CATHY: <i>Give me your bag.</i>

00:19:45.817 --> 00:19:46.652 line:5%,start
<i>It is wet.</i>

00:19:46.718 --> 00:19:47.853 line:5%,start
<i>Why is your bag wet, Vivi?</i>

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.321 line:95%,end
Probably from my applesauce.

00:19:49.388 --> 00:19:51.023 line:95%,end
What did it do, have an explosion?

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:52.391 line:95%,end
Mm-hmm.

00:19:52.457 --> 00:19:53.725 line:95%,end
Oh, my God, Vivi.

00:19:53.792 --> 00:19:55.427 line:95%,end
VIVI-ANNE: That always happens.

00:19:55.894 --> 00:19:56.995 line:95%,end
But this?

00:19:57.062 --> 00:19:57.930 line:95%,end
Oh, my gosh.

00:19:57.996 --> 00:19:59.331 line:95%,end
-CATHY: What is that?
-VIVI-ANNE: I don't know.

00:19:59.398 --> 00:20:01.300 line:95%,end
CATHY: I don't understand what you did.

00:20:01.366 --> 00:20:02.301 line:95%,end
Don't sickle your foot.

00:20:02.367 --> 00:20:03.869 line:95%,end
-Do all of them.
-Here. Here.

00:20:04.536 --> 00:20:05.470 line:95%,end
-Push.
-Do all--

00:20:05.537 --> 00:20:06.872 line:95%,end
I hear you! Push your foot.

00:20:06.939 --> 00:20:07.839 line:95%,end
Push your heel forward.

00:20:07.906 --> 00:20:08.874 line:95%,end
-Do all--
-That's beautiful.

00:20:08.941 --> 00:20:11.343 line:95%,end
Vivi-Anne is a beautiful little girl.

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:13.512 line:95%,end
If I start to discipline her now

00:20:13.579 --> 00:20:15.280 line:95%,end
on etiquette and appearance,

00:20:15.347 --> 00:20:18.383 line:95%,end
she is going to grow up
to be a very poised young woman.

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:20.586 line:95%,end
Can you tell me about your solo?

00:20:20.652 --> 00:20:21.887 line:95%,end
I don't know.

00:20:22.354 --> 00:20:24.089 line:95%,end
Do you want to do your solo this weekend?

00:20:24.957 --> 00:20:25.791 line:95%,end
No.


00:20:25.857 --> 00:20:27.226 line:95%,end
I don't want to do it.

00:20:27.292 --> 00:20:28.193 line:95%,end
You don't want to do it.

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:30.529 line:95%,end
My mom wants me to dance even more

00:20:30.596 --> 00:20:31.597 line:95%,end
than I want to.

00:20:31.663 --> 00:20:32.864 line:95%,end
Remember, I told you--listen.

00:20:32.931 --> 00:20:34.633 line:95%,end
Remember, I told you that I would be

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:36.068 line:95%,end
at the side of the stage?

00:20:36.134 --> 00:20:37.135 line:95%,end
(clears throat)

00:20:37.202 --> 00:20:39.338 line:95%,end
What if I stand at the side of the stage

00:20:39.404 --> 00:20:40.339 line:95%,end
and I count for you?

00:20:40.405 --> 00:20:41.306 line:95%,end
No.

00:20:41.373 --> 00:20:42.774 line:95%,end
What--what do you think

00:20:42.841 --> 00:20:44.509 line:95%,end
is going to happen if you get up on stage?

00:20:44.576 --> 00:20:45.877 line:95%,end
I'll probably forget it.

00:20:45.944 --> 00:20:47.412 line:95%,end
What if we tried practicing it?

00:20:47.813 --> 00:20:48.814 line:95%,end
No.

00:20:49.314 --> 00:20:51.950 line:95%,end
I still won't be able to do it.

00:20:52.017 --> 00:20:53.485 line:95%,end
So how--

00:20:53.552 --> 00:20:55.020 line:95%,end
how am I supposed to handle this?

00:20:55.087 --> 00:20:56.355 line:95%,end
What do you want me to do?

00:20:57.456 --> 00:20:59.057 line:95%,end
Hm? Look what happened last week.

00:20:59.124 --> 00:21:01.526 line:95%,end
You went on stage
and you did that duo with--

00:21:01.593 --> 00:21:03.695 line:95%,end
I know. I like to dance--

00:21:03.762 --> 00:21:05.631 line:95%,end
dance with other people.

00:21:05.697 --> 00:21:07.032 line:95%,end
Not a solo.

00:21:09.167 --> 00:21:10.969 line:95%,end
CATHY: <i>I just feel that Vivi</i>
<i>is very overwhelmed</i>

00:21:11.036 --> 00:21:12.004 line:95%,end
<i>right at the moment.</i>

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:14.039 line:95%,end
<i>She has never had a solo before.</i>

00:21:14.106 --> 00:21:15.741 line:5%,start
Going out on stage,

00:21:15.807 --> 00:21:17.209 line:5%,start
forgetting your dance,

00:21:17.276 --> 00:21:19.478 line:5%,start
and then just standing there--

00:21:19.544 --> 00:21:22.180 line:5%,start
just standing there
and then finally running off

00:21:22.247 --> 00:21:24.983 line:5%,start
is the--is the ultimate worst thing

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:26.184 line:5%,start
to happen at competition.

00:21:26.251 --> 00:21:27.953 line:5%,start
Not only are you embarrassed,

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:29.354 line:5%,start
but the judges--

00:21:29.421 --> 00:21:30.656 line:95%,end
they're not even going to score you.

00:21:30.722 --> 00:21:32.157 line:95%,end
<i>It's no different than a child</i>

00:21:32.224 --> 00:21:33.425 line:95%,end
<i>who comes into class</i>

00:21:33.492 --> 00:21:34.960 line:95%,end
<i>and pees their pants</i>

00:21:35.027 --> 00:21:36.728 line:95%,end
<i>and doesn't want to go back</i>
<i>in the dance studio.</i>

00:21:36.795 --> 00:21:39.264 line:95%,end
<i>Mentally, she is not prepared.</i>

00:21:40.299 --> 00:21:43.302 line:5%,start
(dramatic music playing)

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:46.371 line:95%,end
DR. VITALE: <i>How you doing? Dr. Vitale.</i>

00:21:46.438 --> 00:21:48.373 line:95%,end
-Very nice to meet you guys.
-(chuckles)

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:49.341 line:95%,end
DR. VITALE: Come on back.

00:21:49.408 --> 00:21:51.610 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>Brooke's hip's</i>
<i>been bothering her all week.</i>

00:21:51.677 --> 00:21:53.045 line:95%,end
<i>She had pulled some muscles,</i>

00:21:53.111 --> 00:21:54.379 line:95%,end
<i>and I'm just worried about</i>

00:21:54.446 --> 00:21:56.214 line:95%,end
<i>how she's going to be able</i>
<i>to perform with it.</i>

00:21:56.281 --> 00:21:58.483 line:95%,end
So I decided to take her to a chiropractor

00:21:58.550 --> 00:21:59.551 line:95%,end
for the first time.

00:22:00.018 --> 00:22:01.153 line:95%,end
How did you hurt it, do you know?

00:22:01.219 --> 00:22:02.954 line:95%,end
-She's a dancer.
-DR. VITALE: Okay.

00:22:03.021 --> 00:22:05.023 line:95%,end
And she does a lot of contortion tricks.

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:07.559 line:95%,end
Is it like, a sharp, stabbing pain,
an achy pain?

00:22:07.626 --> 00:22:08.927 line:95%,end
When I do a split and stuff,

00:22:08.994 --> 00:22:10.028 line:95%,end
it's, like, shooting pain.

00:22:10.095 --> 00:22:12.297 line:95%,end
DR. VITALE: Okay.
And what have you been doing for it--

00:22:12.364 --> 00:22:13.498 line:95%,end
anything since it started?

00:22:13.565 --> 00:22:15.534 line:95%,end
-We've put ice on it...
-Okay.

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:16.735 line:95%,end
...when it first happened.

00:22:16.802 --> 00:22:17.636 line:95%,end
DR. VITALE: That's good.

00:22:17.703 --> 00:22:20.172 line:95%,end
KELLY: And sometimes,
she sleeps with a heating pad.

00:22:20.238 --> 00:22:21.239 line:95%,end
That's not good.

00:22:21.606 --> 00:22:23.408 line:95%,end
Did you have problems practicing?

00:22:24.209 --> 00:22:25.877 line:95%,end
Any stuff with splits in it is tough.

00:22:25.944 --> 00:22:27.379 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>Me, as a mom, I'm worried</i>

00:22:27.446 --> 00:22:29.414 line:95%,end
<i>to allow her to go on stage</i>

00:22:29.481 --> 00:22:31.149 line:95%,end
<i>and perform an acrobatic routine</i>

00:22:31.216 --> 00:22:33.018 line:95%,end
<i>because it is very strenuous on the hip.</i>

00:22:33.085 --> 00:22:35.554 line:95%,end
I just don't know what to do.
I don't know if I should allow her

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:37.923 line:95%,end
or if I should make her stay out.

00:22:37.989 --> 00:22:40.158 line:95%,end
Okay. What I want you to do
is kind of bend over.

00:22:40.225 --> 00:22:41.827 line:95%,end
Okay, just at your waist.

00:22:41.893 --> 00:22:43.729 line:95%,end
Tell me if it causes any problems.

00:22:44.563 --> 00:22:45.397 line:95%,end
BROOKE: Right there.

00:22:45.464 --> 00:22:47.132 line:95%,end
-Where do you feel the pain?
-Right here.

00:22:47.733 --> 00:22:49.735 line:95%,end
Okay. How about over to this side?

00:22:51.503 --> 00:22:52.971 line:95%,end
-Mm-hmm.
-Same place?

00:22:53.638 --> 00:22:54.473 line:95%,end
Okay.

You know, I mean, it's just--

00:23:00.178 --> 00:23:01.847 line:95%,end
it's what you have to do.

<i>I think Brooke will be fine.</i>

00:23:04.816 --> 00:23:06.952 line:95%,end
Okay. You're talking about
some serious problems.

00:23:07.486 --> 00:23:08.553 line:95%,end
We don't want to go there.

(suspenseful music playing)

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:14.393 line:95%,end

for her to be competing today
or this weekend,

00:23:16.528 --> 00:23:17.429 line:95%,end
to be honest with you.

00:23:19.865 --> 00:23:20.699 line:95%,end
We have to.

<i>It is closer to New York City,</i>

00:23:31.676 --> 00:23:33.111 line:5%,start

My hip hurts.

00:25:09.207 --> 00:25:11.910 line:95%,end
Does it feel bruised or does it feel...

00:25:12.677 --> 00:25:13.945 line:95%,end
like, hurt inside?

00:25:14.012 --> 00:25:14.946 line:95%,end
Inside.

00:25:15.013 --> 00:25:17.349 line:95%,end

00:25:23.288 --> 00:25:24.923 line:95%,end

00:25:28.493 --> 00:25:30.795 line:95%,end

<i>They think I strained it.</i>

00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:33.965 line:95%,end
ABBY: You just have to grind that down.

00:25:34.533 --> 00:25:36.635 line:95%,end
Those hip flexors, they catch on the bone

00:25:36.701 --> 00:25:37.569 line:95%,end
as she's growing.

00:25:37.636 --> 00:25:39.404 line:95%,end
And you need to open that turnout up,

00:25:39.471 --> 00:25:41.706 line:95%,end
so as it happens it grinds down.

00:25:41.773 --> 00:25:43.208 line:95%,end
And then it won't hurt anymore.

00:25:43.275 --> 00:25:44.776 line:95%,end
BROOKE: <i>Miss Abby said that</i>

00:25:44.843 --> 00:25:46.578 line:95%,end
I should, like, grind it down.

00:25:46.645 --> 00:25:48.313 line:95%,end

00:25:57.589 --> 00:25:59.724 line:95%,end
you know that we've traveled a long way...

00:25:59.791 --> 00:26:01.092 line:95%,end
-Uh-huh.

00:26:01.159 --> 00:26:03.328 line:95%,end
if we don't win the competition.

00:26:03.395 --> 00:26:05.063 line:95%,end
So we have to be prepared for that.

-We could have a letdown, okay?

00:26:06.798 --> 00:26:07.999 line:95%,end
Okay.

Okay.

we arrive the night before,

00:26:25.383 --> 00:26:26.585 line:95%,end
but not today.

00:26:26.651 --> 00:26:28.420 line:95%,end
Of course, we're only arriving
two hours early.

Hi, um...

I'm going to be backstage with you guys.

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:22.907 line:95%,end
I just want to go over a few things

00:27:22.974 --> 00:27:25.076 line:95%,end
because we have some song titles missing.

RITA: I have <i>My Pumps</i> first,
and that's Vivi-Anne, right?

00:27:29.814 --> 00:27:31.516 line:95%,end
ABBY: No. It's not <i>My Pumps.</i>

00:27:31.583 --> 00:27:33.251 line:95%,end

-RITA: <i>Bumblebee?</i>

But what's...

00:27:35.887 --> 00:27:37.322 line:95%,end
Yes. You want to come with me?

00:27:37.389 --> 00:27:38.356 line:95%,end
What is this?

00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:40.291 line:95%,end
That's what I'm confused about.

00:27:40.358 --> 00:27:41.626 line:95%,end
We need to--okay.

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.194 line:95%,end
-Cathy.
-CATHY: Yes?

00:27:43.261 --> 00:27:45.230 line:95%,end
What is with this little <i>Rock It</i> music?

00:27:45.664 --> 00:27:46.798 line:95%,end
Um...

00:27:48.066 --> 00:27:50.735 line:95%,end
Vivi was uncomfortable with the solo

00:27:50.802 --> 00:27:52.437 line:95%,end
that we worked on...

00:27:54.172 --> 00:27:57.575 line:95%,end
because she had
such a lack of rehearsal time.

00:27:58.977 --> 00:28:00.578 line:95%,end
And so we are going to go ahead

00:28:00.645 --> 00:28:03.148 line:95%,end
and do a piece that she already knows.

00:28:06.051 --> 00:28:07.519 line:95%,end

I'm just going to change this
to independent entry.

00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:21.166 line:95%,end
You're doing what?
You're changing it to independent?

00:28:21.232 --> 00:28:22.300 line:95%,end
Yes.

00:28:22.934 --> 00:28:25.470 line:95%,end
She's not going to be going
underneath your name?

00:28:25.537 --> 00:28:26.805 line:95%,end
I didn't do this number.

00:28:27.439 --> 00:28:29.974 line:95%,end
But she's--but she's going to be
representing you.

00:28:30.041 --> 00:28:32.077 line:95%,end
Not with a number I didn't do

00:28:32.143 --> 00:28:33.978 line:95%,end
in a costume I didn't design.

00:28:34.045 --> 00:28:36.014 line:95%,end
Okay. Can I see you outside, please?

00:28:39.884 --> 00:28:43.822 line:5%,start
We kind of went
against the philosophy of Abby,

00:28:43.888 --> 00:28:47.492 line:95%,end
<i>so consequently,</i>
<i>we had the wrath of Abby upon us.</i>

00:28:47.892 --> 00:28:50.495 line:95%,end
Please, we need to change this
independent thing

00:28:50.562 --> 00:28:51.429 line:95%,end
because it's important to us.

00:28:51.496 --> 00:28:53.231 line:95%,end
I have never seen her even do the number.

00:28:53.298 --> 00:28:54.899 line:95%,end
I know. You're going to have to trust me.

00:28:54.966 --> 00:28:56.234 line:95%,end
Abby, listen to me.

00:28:56.301 --> 00:28:57.969 line:95%,end
I'm not one of these dance moms.

00:28:58.036 --> 00:28:59.471 line:95%,end
Yeah, I'm Vivi's mom

00:28:59.537 --> 00:29:00.739 line:95%,end
and we're involved in dance,

00:29:00.805 --> 00:29:03.575 line:95%,end
but I'm not that hysterical dance mom.

00:29:03.641 --> 00:29:06.177 line:95%,end
<i>I know what is correct to take to stage.</i>

00:29:06.244 --> 00:29:08.780 line:95%,end
You and I are over here.

00:29:08.847 --> 00:29:11.382 line:95%,end
And if I have to make
an executive decision,

00:29:11.449 --> 00:29:14.219 line:95%,end
then you have to trust me
just as I will trust you.

00:29:14.285 --> 00:29:15.587 line:95%,end
Cathy, I came through.

00:29:15.653 --> 00:29:17.288 line:95%,end
I got the costume finished.

00:29:17.355 --> 00:29:18.456 line:95%,end
The dance was finished.

00:29:18.523 --> 00:29:19.924 line:95%,end
Any other kid,

00:29:19.991 --> 00:29:21.493 line:95%,end
whether their mother is a dance teacher

00:29:21.559 --> 00:29:23.895 line:95%,end
or their mother's a swimming coach,

00:29:23.962 --> 00:29:26.297 line:95%,end
would have had that dance nailed down.

00:29:28.266 --> 00:29:29.901 line:95%,end
She could not do a dance

00:29:29.968 --> 00:29:31.936 line:95%,end
that Abby Lee Miller has never seen

00:29:32.003 --> 00:29:33.872 line:95%,end
and pretend she came from Abby Lee Miller.

00:29:33.938 --> 00:29:35.774 line:95%,end
I have to put into perspective

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:38.176 line:95%,end
what my child's mental capacity is,

00:29:38.243 --> 00:29:39.844 line:95%,end
then she gets up on stage and she cracks--

00:29:39.911 --> 00:29:41.513 line:95%,end
I don't want it to be detrimental
for any child.

00:29:41.579 --> 00:29:42.580 line:95%,end
But I'm just saying,

00:29:42.647 --> 00:29:44.783 line:95%,end
you don't have the faith
in your kid that I do.

00:29:45.283 --> 00:29:46.384 line:95%,end
If you would have just ran it

00:29:46.451 --> 00:29:48.052 line:95%,end
maybe 10 times a day

00:29:48.119 --> 00:29:49.988 line:95%,end
for three days--

00:29:50.054 --> 00:29:51.055 line:95%,end
We tried with the bribery.

00:29:51.122 --> 00:29:53.024 line:95%,end
-We tried with getting her to get an iPad.
-You don't need to bribe her.

00:29:53.091 --> 00:29:54.058 line:95%,end
-You're the mommy.
-I know that.

00:29:54.125 --> 00:29:55.493 line:95%,end
-Just say, you're doing it.
-I realize that.

00:29:57.262 --> 00:29:59.164 line:95%,end
-I want to see her dance first.
-Okay.

00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:01.199 line:95%,end
-So you will--
-Give me that respect.

00:30:01.266 --> 00:30:02.634 line:95%,end
And when she goes out for awards,

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:04.402 line:95%,end
I want her and something red and black

00:30:04.469 --> 00:30:05.370 line:95%,end
-or a costume.
-Okay. I can--

00:30:05.436 --> 00:30:06.371 line:95%,end
Okay. Then she'll go out in costume.

00:30:06.437 --> 00:30:07.839 line:95%,end
Moms that go against me

00:30:07.906 --> 00:30:09.107 line:95%,end
don't last very long.

00:30:09.174 --> 00:30:10.942 line:95%,end

00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:28.226 line:95%,end
She likes to say that I'm her colleague.

00:30:28.293 --> 00:30:29.561 line:95%,end
Three, four, guns!

00:30:29.627 --> 00:30:31.396 line:95%,end
I may have to have special favors

00:30:31.462 --> 00:30:33.231 line:95%,end

all of the acro moves,

00:38:18.396 --> 00:38:20.631 line:95%,end

Starbound this weekend,

either you won it all
or you didn't even place.

BROOKE: <i>I was very nervous</i>

00:39:56.761 --> 00:39:59.663 line:95%,end
<i>And I didn't think I'd be able to do</i>
<i>a lot of things.</i>

00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:01.932 line:95%,end
But I guess we pulled it off

00:40:01.999 --> 00:40:03.234 line:95%,end
because we got first place.

00:40:04.235 --> 00:40:06.837 line:95%,end
<i>This weekend, my friends asked me</i>
<i>to go to the mall with them</i>

00:40:06.904 --> 00:40:08.739 line:95%,end
<i>and there was, like, two parties going on.</i>

00:40:08.806 --> 00:40:12.276 line:95%,end
<i>But since we won,</i>
<i>everything, like, turned out okay.</i>

00:40:13.077 --> 00:40:15.346 line:95%,end
It's hard to decide
which I would have rather been to

00:40:15.413 --> 00:40:16.647 line:95%,end
because I don't know how the parties went.

00:40:16.714 --> 00:40:18.482 line:95%,end
Because I was here, instead. (chuckles)

KELLY: <i>I'm very proud of Brooke</i>
<i>for pushing through it</i>

00:40:21.352 --> 00:40:23.120 line:95%,end
and, you know, dealing with the pain,

00:40:23.187 --> 00:40:25.256 line:95%,end
and getting up there and doing her best.

00:40:25.322 --> 00:40:26.690 line:95%,end
I think she did a great job,

00:40:26.757 --> 00:40:27.758 line:95%,end

Brooke, arms pretty. Good.

00:40:31.962 --> 00:40:32.897 line:95%,end
Shoot it.

<i>Winning the overall first place</i>

00:40:34.632 --> 00:40:35.966 line:95%,end
<i>is the best you can be.</i>

00:40:36.033 --> 00:40:38.469 line:95%,end
<i>That's it. You came to win and you win.</i>

00:40:38.536 --> 00:40:41.472 line:95%,end
But it's my job,
as their teacher and their coach,

00:40:41.539 --> 00:40:42.840 line:95%,end
to keep them grounded.

00:40:42.907 --> 00:40:45.643 line:95%,end
<i>So Monday,</i>
<i>when we go back into the studio,</i>

00:40:45.709 --> 00:40:47.545 line:95%,end
I have to knock them down a few pegs.

00:40:47.611 --> 00:40:49.113 line:95%,end
<i>You have to keep a dancer humble.</i>

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:50.981 line:95%,end
<i>There's always room for improvement,</i>

00:40:51.048 --> 00:40:52.616 line:95%,end
and that's my job.

00:40:52.683 --> 00:40:55.519 line:95%,end
Mommy can say, "It's fabulous,"
and "You're the best,"

00:40:55.586 --> 00:40:58.155 line:95%,end
<i>but I have to tell them,</i>
<i>"There's somebody out there better."</i>

00:40:58.222 --> 00:41:00.758 line:95%,end
"There's always someone
going to be better than you."
