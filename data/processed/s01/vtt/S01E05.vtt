ABBY: I'm going to give
every single one of you a solo.

CATHY: <i>Vivi is very uncomfortable</i>

00:00:08.375 --> 00:00:10.410 line:5%,start
Maddie is doing
two solos this weekend.

00:00:10.477 --> 00:00:12.012 line:5%,start
Everybody should have one solo.

00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:13.179 line:5%,start
Aren't you happy?

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:14.114 line:5%,start
No.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.648 line:5%,start
Abby, I think we need to talk.

00:00:15.715 --> 00:00:16.716 line:5%,start
Oh, you're not going to ruin this day.

00:00:16.783 --> 00:00:18.251 line:5%,start
And how many times
has my daughter

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:19.686 line:5%,start
beat your daughter this year?

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:21.087 line:5%,start
That (bleep) bitch!

00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:22.422 line:5%,start
ABBY: <i>Coming up on </i>Dance Moms...

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:25.392 line:5%,start
Moms, you are going
to be performing in the show.

(cheering)

00:00:27.994 --> 00:00:31.431 line:5%,start
ABBY: <i>A major Broadway casting agent</i>

00:00:31.498 --> 00:00:33.366 line:5%,start
<i>My girls better make me look good.</i>

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:34.567 line:5%,start
We can't stop. We can stop. We can stop.

00:00:34.634 --> 00:00:36.002 line:5%,start
VIVI-ANNE: My stomach hurts.

CHRISTI: <i>After the weekend had passed,</i>

00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:54.187 line:5%,start
I really felt
like I needed to call Abby

00:00:54.254 --> 00:00:55.755 line:95%,end
<i>so that we could clear the air.</i>

00:00:55.822 --> 00:00:58.024 line:95%,end
Your daughter
is holding a national title,

00:00:58.091 --> 00:00:59.592 line:95%,end
and I will take it away in a minute!

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:01.895 line:95%,end
You're a uneducated mess!

00:01:01.961 --> 00:01:03.063 line:95%,end
Quit drinking!

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.466 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>Seeing how Abby</i>
<i>gave her favorite, Maddie,</i>

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:09.035 line:95%,end
<i>two solos last week,</i>
<i>I think I had a right to be upset.</i>

00:01:09.102 --> 00:01:10.370 line:95%,end
I think I deserve
an apology, too.

00:01:10.437 --> 00:01:12.672 line:95%,end
But, you know what?
I'll be the bigger woman.

00:01:15.675 --> 00:01:17.377 line:95%,end
Hello.
You wanted to see me?

00:01:17.444 --> 00:01:18.478 line:95%,end
Yes.

00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:20.713 line:95%,end
Abby, I came here
to try to make amends with you.

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:24.784 line:95%,end
I cannot let you
on my property

00:01:25.985 --> 00:01:28.822 line:95%,end
without this being signed.

00:01:28.888 --> 00:01:30.757 line:95%,end
You need to sign this.
I need to go back to work.

00:01:30.824 --> 00:01:33.326 line:95%,end
Abby, I was out of line,
the way I behaved in that room.

00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:37.630 line:95%,end
And I am willing to take responsibility
and apologize for that.

00:01:37.697 --> 00:01:39.966 line:95%,end
I don't feel that where my feelings
were coming from

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:42.569 line:95%,end
or wrong based on things
that had happened to me

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:45.772 line:95%,end
and Chloe for the last year,
two years, three years.

00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:47.574 line:95%,end
If you weren't happy
with the education,

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.675 line:95%,end
you should have left
after the first month.

00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:49.576 line:95%,end
I should have left.

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:51.478 line:95%,end
Chloe would not be
a national title winner.

00:01:51.544 --> 00:01:52.912 line:95%,end
She would be nothing.

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.849 line:95%,end
You're dumb for letting people
walk out of your studio left and right.

00:01:55.915 --> 00:01:59.419 line:95%,end
I was trying to be an adult
and be a bigger person,

00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:00.787 line:95%,end
and she just wasn't having it.

00:02:02.856 --> 00:02:05.225 line:95%,end
White trash.

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:09.062 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>The contract Abby gave me</i>
<i>has incredible stipulations in it,</i>

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.598 line:95%,end
<i>things like I'm not to walk into the den,</i>

00:02:11.664 --> 00:02:13.666 line:95%,end
<i>I'm not allowed to walk</i>
<i>into the dressing room,</i>

00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:15.902 line:95%,end
<i>that I agree</i>
<i>that I'm in the wrong.</i>

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:17.637 line:95%,end
It's important
that Chloe stay at this studio

00:02:17.704 --> 00:02:19.772 line:95%,end
because she's a title holder.

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:22.509 line:95%,end
<i>If we leave,</i>
<i>she loses her titles.</i>

00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:25.712 line:95%,end
You know,
do I sell my soul for a crown?

00:02:25.778 --> 00:02:28.848 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:02:28.915 --> 00:02:30.717 line:5%,start
ABBY: Girls, let's go!

00:02:30.783 --> 00:02:31.918 line:5%,start
Come on, ladies!

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:33.286 line:95%,end
Come on, girls. Let's go!

00:02:33.353 --> 00:02:34.320 line:95%,end
Get in here!

00:02:34.387 --> 00:02:36.623 line:95%,end
First, I want to talk
about this past weekend.

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:39.526 line:95%,end
I am very disappointed.

00:02:39.592 --> 00:02:42.896 line:95%,end
Every single one of you
could have done better on your solo.

00:02:42.962 --> 00:02:45.431 line:95%,end
Moving on,
I want to forget about last weekend.

00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:47.167 line:95%,end
What's going to happen
this weekend?

00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:49.269 line:95%,end
It's the ALDC Showcase.

00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:50.803 line:95%,end
Thank you. Yes.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.107 line:95%,end
<i>The annual Abby Lee</i>
<i>Dance Company Showcase</i>

00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:56.309 line:95%,end
<i>is an event that we do</i>

00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:59.646 line:95%,end
<i>to showcase</i>
<i>all of our competition numbers.</i>

00:02:59.712 --> 00:03:02.248 line:5%,start
This is when
their families, their friends,

00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:07.420 line:5%,start
all of the people
that really don't understand what they do,

00:03:07.487 --> 00:03:09.322 line:95%,end
get to come and see the end result.

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:11.024 line:95%,end
<i>And at the Showcase</i>

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.360 line:95%,end
<i>I watch every solo</i>
<i>and every group number.</i>

00:03:14.427 --> 00:03:16.396 line:95%,end
Then I make a decision
on what's going to go

00:03:16.462 --> 00:03:19.265 line:95%,end
to the next regionals
and onto nationals.

00:03:19.332 --> 00:03:22.235 line:5%,start
We're doing the new number,
"Sugar Daddies," at the showcase.

00:03:22.302 --> 00:03:26.139 line:95%,end
Maddie, you won the overall
high score at the competition. Boom.

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:29.309 line:95%,end
Nia, forgot the "Solo Cup" dancing,
made it up, went on,

00:03:29.375 --> 00:03:30.510 line:95%,end
finished with the music.

00:03:30.577 --> 00:03:33.279 line:95%,end
HOLLY: <i>Nia was assigned</i>
<i>a little bit higher in the pyramid.</i>

00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:35.215 line:95%,end
I think Nia was very excited about that.

00:03:35.281 --> 00:03:37.050 line:95%,end
Chloe did a great job.

00:03:37.116 --> 00:03:39.152 line:95%,end
There were some other situations.

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:40.153 line:95%,end
You're here.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.888 line:95%,end
I want to see
that attitude improve on stage.

00:03:41.955 --> 00:03:43.189 line:95%,end
Yes?

00:03:43.256 --> 00:03:45.058 line:95%,end
You never know
who's watching you.

00:03:45.124 --> 00:03:47.560 line:95%,end
I honestly wasn't surprised
by the pyramid this week.

00:03:47.627 --> 00:03:51.264 line:95%,end
I knew Abby was going to punish Chloe
because of my behavior.


00:03:51.331 --> 00:03:54.734 line:95%,end
All right. I have a few surprises
during the showcase.

00:03:54.801 --> 00:03:57.303 line:95%,end
I don't want to pressure you,
but in the audience

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.340 line:95%,end
at the showcase
it's going to be an agent

00:04:00.406 --> 00:04:04.310 line:95%,end
coming to seek new talent
and looking for new clients to sign.

00:04:04.377 --> 00:04:05.345 line:95%,end
Yes.

00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:07.914 line:95%,end
(cheering and applause)

00:04:07.981 --> 00:04:10.383 line:95%,end
When Abby said
that there was a Broadway talent agent

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.885 line:95%,end
coming to the showcase,
my heart just stopped.

00:04:12.952 --> 00:04:14.254 line:95%,end
I mean, this is huge.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.291 line:95%,end
ABBY: Moms,
you are going to be performing

00:04:18.358 --> 00:04:19.792 line:95%,end
in the show, as well.

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:22.929 line:95%,end
(cheering)

00:04:24.664 --> 00:04:27.533 line:95%,end
ABBY: Oh, Cathy,
you're going to be the choreographer.

00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:31.304 line:95%,end
(laughter)

00:04:31.371 --> 00:04:32.905 line:95%,end
CATHY: You guys are in for trouble.

00:04:32.972 --> 00:04:34.907 line:95%,end
ABBY: Nationals are getting closer
and closer.

00:04:34.974 --> 00:04:38.077 line:95%,end
With every competition
you get better and you get stronger.

00:04:38.144 --> 00:04:41.814 line:95%,end
So this showcase is going to be
a nice chance to entertain

00:04:41.881 --> 00:04:44.884 line:95%,end
rather than compete,
but it all is leading up to nationals.

00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:46.052 line:95%,end
Because we want to do what?

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:47.253 line:95%,end
Win!

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.588 line:95%,end
You got it. All right.

00:04:48.655 --> 00:04:50.723 line:95%,end
I think Abby lays in bed
at night and thinks up this stuff.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.394 line:95%,end
We're going to be on stage
like the hippos in "Fantasia."

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.962 line:95%,end
Go ahead.
You're dismissed.

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:58.464 line:95%,end
Guys, up with "Sugar Daddies."

00:04:58.531 --> 00:05:00.700 line:95%,end
All right, let's go.
Okay, okay, you're like mosquitoes.

00:05:00.767 --> 00:05:03.536 line:5%,start
Get away. Get away. Get away.

00:05:03.603 --> 00:05:06.205 line:5%,start
(upbeat music playing)

00:05:06.272 --> 00:05:07.240 line:5%,start
ABBY: Come on, girls.

00:05:08.675 --> 00:05:11.044 line:95%,end
Do something with your face. Come on!

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.748 line:95%,end
"Sugar Daddies" is a pop jazz routine
and they use props.

00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:18.251 line:95%,end
<i>They're rectangular</i>
<i>in shape and they're--</i>

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:19.218 line:95%,end
they're big.

00:05:19.285 --> 00:05:21.721 line:95%,end
<i>It's just kind of a nightmare.</i>

00:05:21.788 --> 00:05:25.191 line:95%,end
Girls, can I see
some emotional execution?

00:05:28.628 --> 00:05:30.730 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>After the pyramid,</i>
<i>we're sitting upstairs</i>

00:05:30.797 --> 00:05:31.864 line:95%,end
<i>in the viewing room.</i>

00:05:31.931 --> 00:05:34.434 line:95%,end
<i>And it's very awkward</i>
<i>and uncomfortable.</i>

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.169 line:95%,end
Let's go in the hallway!

00:05:36.235 --> 00:05:37.570 line:95%,end
-I'm not going anywhere.
-ABBY: The children just won.

00:05:37.637 --> 00:05:39.372 line:95%,end
-My daughter's happy.
-CHRISTI: Let's go in the hallway.

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:41.174 line:95%,end
Do you want to talk
about all the things

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.042 line:95%,end
that need to be talked about?

00:05:43.109 --> 00:05:45.445 line:95%,end
CATHY: <i>Christi,</i>
<i>I think that she's a beast.</i>

00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:49.215 line:95%,end
<i>She is extremely jealous of Maddie.</i>

00:05:49.282 --> 00:05:52.218 line:5%,start
And Melissa was definitely
a victim, at that point.

00:05:52.285 --> 00:05:53.820 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I have had
some time to reflect,

00:05:53.886 --> 00:05:57.590 line:95%,end
and I just wanted to apologize
to you three and Holly, as well.

00:05:57.657 --> 00:06:00.126 line:95%,end
It just wasn't my finest moment as a--

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:02.195 line:95%,end
an adult, as a person or as a parent.

00:06:02.261 --> 00:06:04.931 line:95%,end
You know, I hope
that we all can move past this.

00:06:04.997 --> 00:06:06.466 line:95%,end
I hope you won't hold it against me.

00:06:06.532 --> 00:06:07.633 line:95%,end
I made a mistake.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.903 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>As far as the fight goes</i>
<i>with Abby and Christi, I'm neutral.</i>

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.706 line:5%,start
I see things Christi agrees with,
and same with Abby.

00:06:13.773 --> 00:06:16.709 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Well, I just want
to apologize to everybody for--

00:06:16.776 --> 00:06:18.478 line:95%,end
-for that. Because...
-Me, too.

00:06:19.645 --> 00:06:21.214 line:95%,end
It was just awful.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.815 line:95%,end
I don't even want to talk about it.

00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:24.484 line:95%,end
I just want to put it behind us.

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.621 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>The thing with Melissa</i>
<i>is she doesn't like confrontation.</i>

00:06:28.688 --> 00:06:31.424 line:95%,end
So when you finally confront her,
you know, oh, no.

00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:33.493 line:95%,end
Everything's fine. Let's move on.
Everything's great.

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:35.728 line:95%,end
<i>So we'll put on that nice front.</i>

00:06:35.795 --> 00:06:38.498 line:95%,end
<i>And, you know, underneath I think</i>
<i>all those emotions are still there.</i>

00:06:38.564 --> 00:06:41.901 line:95%,end
We have a long history,
and I absolutely think

00:06:41.968 --> 00:06:43.469 line:95%,end
Abby and Melissa
owe me an apology.

00:06:43.536 --> 00:06:45.838 line:95%,end
I'm the one who's apologizing.
But, you know what?

00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:47.407 line:95%,end
They were just as wrong as I was.

00:06:47.473 --> 00:06:50.576 line:95%,end
I think we just need to move on
and forget about it.

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:54.013 line:95%,end
KELLY: I think we should go down

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.381 line:95%,end
and see how much longer
they're going to be.

00:06:55.448 --> 00:06:56.482 line:95%,end
Okay.

00:06:58.317 --> 00:07:00.453 line:95%,end
ABBY: Back leg is not high enough!

00:07:03.656 --> 00:07:05.658 line:95%,end
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

00:07:11.364 --> 00:07:13.499 line:95%,end
(jazz music playing)

00:07:16.135 --> 00:07:18.438 line:95%,end
CATHY: <i>I was really happy</i>
<i>that Abby chose me</i>

00:07:18.504 --> 00:07:20.106 line:95%,end
to choreograph a mom's dance.

00:07:21.674 --> 00:07:25.611 line:95%,end
<i>My vision is that I give them</i>
<i>very simple choreography</i>

00:07:25.678 --> 00:07:27.980 line:95%,end
<i>that is going</i>
<i>to make them look good.</i>

00:07:28.047 --> 00:07:30.349 line:95%,end
Because I'm sure
that all of them have two left feet.

00:07:31.684 --> 00:07:33.019 line:95%,end
-Hello.
-Oh!

00:07:33.085 --> 00:07:35.855 line:95%,end
-Hi!
-Hello. Are you guys ready?

00:07:35.922 --> 00:07:37.557 line:95%,end
I don't know
if we'll ever be ready.

00:07:37.623 --> 00:07:39.659 line:95%,end
<i>I was one of Abby's students</i>
<i>years ago,</i>

00:07:39.725 --> 00:07:42.895 line:95%,end
so it's weird for me to be in the studio
as a dancer again,


00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:44.497 line:95%,end
and not as a dance mom.

00:07:44.564 --> 00:07:46.199 line:95%,end
And one and two,
sit, three, four,

00:07:46.265 --> 00:07:47.600 line:95%,end
go five, go six, go seven...

00:07:47.667 --> 00:07:50.236 line:95%,end
-(laughter)
-This is so embarrassing!

00:07:50.303 --> 00:07:53.873 line:95%,end
And a one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.741 line:95%,end
-Hi, Holly.
-Hi, birthday girl!

00:07:55.808 --> 00:07:57.543 line:95%,end
CATHY: You look like you're ready
to dance.

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:00.413 line:95%,end
-We're still missing Christi, obviously.
-It's hot in here.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.883 line:95%,end
CATHY: We had a rehearsal call time
that I had scheduled.

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:05.918 line:95%,end
<i>Christi, however, was not there.</i>

00:08:05.985 --> 00:08:07.720 line:95%,end
And it seems
like at every turn

00:08:07.787 --> 00:08:09.655 line:95%,end
there there's a dramatic issue with her.

00:08:09.722 --> 00:08:12.191 line:95%,end
Drop step, ball change.

00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:16.596 line:95%,end
Gosh, I'm so glad
that you decided

00:08:16.662 --> 00:08:18.531 line:95%,end
to finally grace us with your presence.

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:22.034 line:95%,end
<i>Christi came in very late.</i>

00:08:22.101 --> 00:08:24.203 line:95%,end
We had very little time
to prepare for this,

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:26.706 line:95%,end
<i>and I expect you</i>
<i>to be on time to get the job done.</i>

00:08:26.772 --> 00:08:28.508 line:95%,end
All right.
So you watch what we're doing,

00:08:28.574 --> 00:08:30.142 line:95%,end
Christi, and try to take notes.

00:08:30.209 --> 00:08:33.846 line:95%,end
One and two, ball change, Lindy.

00:08:33.913 --> 00:08:35.214 line:95%,end
CHRISTI:
I'm not interested in dancing.

00:08:35.281 --> 00:08:36.482 line:95%,end
My ship has sailed.

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:37.850 line:95%,end
I don't want to be on stage.

00:08:37.917 --> 00:08:40.586 line:95%,end
<i>And not only do I have</i>
<i>to perform this dance</i>

00:08:40.653 --> 00:08:42.321 line:95%,end
<i>that I really don't want to do,</i>

00:08:42.388 --> 00:08:46.325 line:95%,end
but then I have to let Cathy
be in charge of me.

00:08:46.392 --> 00:08:48.628 line:95%,end
<i>I mean, I have to do it</i>
<i>or Abby's going to punish Chloe,</i>

00:08:48.694 --> 00:08:51.197 line:95%,end
<i>whether it be for me</i>
<i>and my actions or just in general.</i>

00:08:51.264 --> 00:08:53.699 line:95%,end
And I didn't feel like putting
a bull's eye on Chloe this week,

00:08:53.766 --> 00:08:55.334 line:95%,end
and that's exactly
what she would've done.

00:08:55.401 --> 00:08:56.969 line:95%,end
You're going to do it one at a time.

00:08:58.371 --> 00:09:00.439 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I--
Cathy, this is not funny to me.

00:09:00.506 --> 00:09:01.707 line:95%,end
Like, this is humiliating.

00:09:01.774 --> 00:09:02.909 line:95%,end
KELLY: We like to be a group.

00:09:02.975 --> 00:09:05.811 line:95%,end
I know. But it's very important
that we can show

00:09:05.878 --> 00:09:07.246 line:95%,end
that we can go out
and do something on our own.

00:09:07.313 --> 00:09:08.414 line:95%,end
Shoulders,
that could be 16-count, too.

00:09:08.481 --> 00:09:10.216 line:95%,end
I don't want to do this.
I feel so stupid.

00:09:10.283 --> 00:09:11.450 line:95%,end
I could go on there like...

00:09:11.517 --> 00:09:14.220 line:95%,end
Five, six, seven, go.

00:09:14.287 --> 00:09:17.056 line:95%,end
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

00:09:17.123 --> 00:09:18.057 line:95%,end
-Woo!
-Yes!

00:09:18.124 --> 00:09:20.059 line:95%,end
-(applause)
-(laughter)

00:09:20.126 --> 00:09:22.595 line:95%,end
Oh, my God.
My mom said she used to be a good dancer.

00:09:22.662 --> 00:09:23.696 line:95%,end
(laughter)

00:09:23.763 --> 00:09:25.431 line:95%,end
Things have changed.

00:09:25.498 --> 00:09:27.967 line:95%,end
(jazz music playing)

00:09:29.902 --> 00:09:31.137 line:95%,end
(laughter)

00:09:31.203 --> 00:09:33.205 line:95%,end
MELISSA:
<i>I never really took dance as a kid.</i>

00:09:33.272 --> 00:09:34.807 line:95%,end
<i>Maddie makes it look so easy,</i>

00:09:34.874 --> 00:09:36.442 line:95%,end
<i>I just thought it would be a breeze.</i>

00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:38.678 line:95%,end
Yeah!
Ooh, yeah!

00:09:38.744 --> 00:09:42.381 line:95%,end
Oh, my God!
Holly, you are amazing.

00:09:42.448 --> 00:09:43.482 line:95%,end
Let's do it together.

00:09:43.549 --> 00:09:46.252 line:95%,end
Holly had some African dance in college,

00:09:46.319 --> 00:09:50.056 line:95%,end
<i>and she had a real</i>
<i>easy rhythm about her</i>

00:09:50.122 --> 00:09:51.290 line:95%,end
like she was, like, a lioness.

00:09:51.357 --> 00:09:54.927 line:95%,end
<i>So I was very excited to utilize Holly</i>

00:09:54.994 --> 00:09:56.395 line:95%,end
<i>and what she could do.</i>

00:09:58.531 --> 00:09:59.632 line:95%,end
KELLY: Oh, my gosh.

00:10:00.933 --> 00:10:01.767 line:95%,end
I don't want to do this.

00:10:01.834 --> 00:10:04.003 line:95%,end
Oh, if you would just
stop worrying about it

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:05.338 line:95%,end
you might have fun.

00:10:05.404 --> 00:10:07.607 line:95%,end
I don't want to have fun.
I like being backstage.

00:10:07.673 --> 00:10:10.676 line:95%,end
Nobody wants to see a fat ass
old mother on stage dancing.

00:10:10.743 --> 00:10:13.512 line:95%,end
Then you know what? This dance
is here to try and lift your spirits

00:10:13.579 --> 00:10:15.047 line:95%,end
and give you a little bit more confidence.

00:10:15.114 --> 00:10:16.582 line:95%,end
Because, clearly,
you're lacking in it.

00:10:21.187 --> 00:10:23.656 line:5%,start
ABBY: Come on in, moms.
I have a big announcement to make.

00:10:23.723 --> 00:10:27.560 line:5%,start
We have a casting associate
from Telsey and Company

00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:31.731 line:95%,end
coming right here
to my studio to look at all of you.

00:10:31.797 --> 00:10:34.233 line:95%,end
They are casting
the new production of "Annie."

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.035 line:95%,end
It's going back to Broadway.

00:10:36.102 --> 00:10:38.638 line:95%,end
(applause)

00:10:38.704 --> 00:10:39.939 line:5%,start
I think Maddie
is definitely prepared,

00:10:40.006 --> 00:10:41.707 line:5%,start
more than the other younger girls.

00:10:41.774 --> 00:10:44.010 line:5%,start
Because she's been
to several Broadway auditions

00:10:44.076 --> 00:10:45.978 line:95%,end
and she does take voice lessons
every week.

00:10:46.045 --> 00:10:49.048 line:95%,end
Cesar is the representative
that will be in town.

00:10:49.115 --> 00:10:51.917 line:95%,end
He wants you
to have a picture and resume.

00:10:51.984 --> 00:10:55.021 line:95%,end
Apparently, Cathy and Holly
have somewhere better to be,

00:10:55.087 --> 00:10:57.089 line:95%,end
so please make sure
they know what's going on.

00:10:57.156 --> 00:10:59.525 line:95%,end
I don't want their kids to be left out
because they're not here.

00:10:59.592 --> 00:11:01.127 line:95%,end
Okay, moms, you're dismissed.

00:11:01.193 --> 00:11:03.462 line:95%,end
And let's get back
to "Sugar Daddies."

00:11:03.529 --> 00:11:04.497 line:95%,end
Let's go.

00:11:04.563 --> 00:11:07.633 line:5%,start
I do want to be on Broadway someday
because lots of people

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.936 line:95%,end
would come
just to see that one person.

00:11:11.003 --> 00:11:12.038 line:95%,end
And that might be me.

00:11:12.104 --> 00:11:13.839 line:95%,end
ABBY: Let's go. Places.

00:11:13.906 --> 00:11:16.042 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>This is the first time</i>
<i>Chloe is one-on-one</i>

00:11:16.108 --> 00:11:18.411 line:95%,end
<i>with a Broadway casting agent,</i>
<i>and I'm dying.</i>

00:11:18.477 --> 00:11:21.280 line:95%,end
It finally gives her a chance
where she can shine

00:11:21.347 --> 00:11:22.748 line:95%,end
and she's not being
upstaged by Maddie.

00:11:22.815 --> 00:11:24.684 line:95%,end
ABBY: Straight arms.
Let's do it.


00:11:25.818 --> 00:11:29.155 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:11:32.625 --> 00:11:34.493 line:95%,end
CATHY: A casting director
is going to be coming

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:37.029 line:5%,start
to the showcase,
and everybody was supposed

00:11:37.096 --> 00:11:41.333 line:95%,end
to have their resume and a head shot
prepared to give to him.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.035 line:95%,end
ABBY: Girls, let's go!

00:11:43.102 --> 00:11:45.404 line:95%,end
The most important things
to bring to an audition

00:11:45.471 --> 00:11:47.840 line:95%,end
would be your resume,
your head shot

00:11:47.907 --> 00:11:49.675 line:5%,start
<i>and, of course, your talent.</i>

00:11:49.742 --> 00:11:51.143 line:5%,start
One, up!

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.481 line:95%,end
Point those feet. Come on.

00:11:57.216 --> 00:11:58.484 line:95%,end
Tilt that head.

00:11:58.551 --> 00:11:59.785 line:95%,end
Releve.

00:11:59.852 --> 00:12:00.920 line:95%,end
Stick your butt out.

00:12:00.986 --> 00:12:02.021 line:95%,end
Flip, flirty.

00:12:02.088 --> 00:12:03.656 line:95%,end
Both arms reaching.

00:12:04.957 --> 00:12:05.958 line:95%,end
Ugh.

00:12:06.025 --> 00:12:06.992 line:95%,end
Delete.

00:12:07.059 --> 00:12:09.361 line:95%,end
The girls have one shot
with his talent agent

00:12:09.428 --> 00:12:11.497 line:95%,end
and the photos
need to be perfect.

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:13.499 line:95%,end
Do it again.

00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:14.934 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.268 line:5%,start
Supporting foot, turned out.

00:12:16.335 --> 00:12:17.603 line:5%,start
Supporting foot, turned out.

00:12:21.741 --> 00:12:23.976 line:95%,end
Back leg is not high enough!

00:12:24.043 --> 00:12:26.846 line:95%,end
10 times, 10 times, I've told her.

00:12:26.912 --> 00:12:29.115 line:95%,end
<i>There's lots of things</i>
<i>that could go wrong with a number</i>

00:12:29.181 --> 00:12:30.549 line:95%,end
<i>when you use props.</i>

00:12:30.616 --> 00:12:33.185 line:95%,end
These "Sugar Daddy" lollipops can break.

00:12:33.252 --> 00:12:34.887 line:95%,end
You could injure yourself with them.

00:12:34.954 --> 00:12:37.223 line:95%,end
You could injure somebody else next
to you with them.

00:12:37.289 --> 00:12:40.726 line:95%,end
You're too far stage right!
No one's going to see you!

00:12:44.563 --> 00:12:46.031 line:95%,end
They're really heavy?

00:12:46.098 --> 00:12:47.633 line:95%,end
-GIANNA: Yeah.
-(indistinct chatter)

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:50.636 line:95%,end
ABBY: If any of you
ever work professionally,

00:12:50.703 --> 00:12:53.939 line:95%,end
a comment like that
is going to get you fired.

00:12:54.006 --> 00:12:55.141 line:95%,end
Deal with it.

00:12:55.207 --> 00:12:56.942 line:95%,end
Let's go, from the top.

00:12:57.009 --> 00:12:59.478 line:5%,start
The "Sugar Daddy" props
were bigger than I was,

00:12:59.545 --> 00:13:00.780 line:95%,end
<i>so they're really hard to dance with.</i>

00:13:02.014 --> 00:13:04.350 line:95%,end
Left leg, higher on the straddle.

00:13:04.416 --> 00:13:06.051 line:95%,end
GIANNA: One, up. Two, up.

00:13:06.118 --> 00:13:10.422 line:95%,end
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

00:13:10.489 --> 00:13:13.392 line:95%,end
BROOKE: Ow! Ow.

00:13:13.459 --> 00:13:16.328 line:95%,end
(CRYING)

00:13:16.395 --> 00:13:18.297 line:95%,end
ABBY: What happened?

00:13:18.364 --> 00:13:19.765 line:95%,end
She hit my face.

00:13:23.335 --> 00:13:25.004 line:95%,end
The stick went up my nose.

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:25.905 line:95%,end
ABBY: All by itself?

00:13:27.406 --> 00:13:28.707 line:95%,end
She was right behind me and...

00:13:28.774 --> 00:13:30.376 line:95%,end
ABBY: Your back hit her stick?

00:13:30.442 --> 00:13:32.411 line:95%,end
Yeah, and then it hit her in the mouth.

00:13:32.478 --> 00:13:35.314 line:95%,end
ABBY: Let me see. Is it bleeding?

00:13:35.381 --> 00:13:37.316 line:95%,end
Are you all right?

00:13:37.383 --> 00:13:39.852 line:95%,end
It just feels weird, huh,
because it's swollen?

I don't know why Abby would put
Christi and I as the PR people

00:14:30.569 --> 00:14:31.904 line:95%,end
It has to be
some kind of punishment.

00:14:33.072 --> 00:14:34.340 line:5%,start
Abby made us come here today.

-Can we...

00:14:45.651 --> 00:14:46.585 line:95%,end
No, thank you.

00:14:46.652 --> 00:14:48.254 line:95%,end
-No? Oh, come on.
-You don't want flyers?

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.488 line:95%,end
-We're just giving you flyers.
-You want one.

00:14:49.555 --> 00:14:50.756 line:95%,end
I know you do.
Just take it!

00:14:50.823 --> 00:14:53.525 line:95%,end
Oh, I've never been
rejected by three men at once.

00:14:53.592 --> 00:14:54.693 line:95%,end
(laughs)

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:56.195 line:95%,end
My God, it's a dance recital.

00:14:56.262 --> 00:14:57.730 line:95%,end
There's rhinestones and sequins.

00:14:57.796 --> 00:14:58.898 line:95%,end
We're in Shadyside.

00:14:58.964 --> 00:15:00.966 line:95%,end
Come on,
where's all the gay men?

00:15:01.033 --> 00:15:02.034 line:95%,end
Hello.

00:15:02.101 --> 00:15:03.769 line:95%,end
Can we give you guys
a flyer for our daughters'

dance recital this weekend?

00:15:05.237 --> 00:15:06.205 line:95%,end
Do you dance?

00:15:06.272 --> 00:15:07.239 line:95%,end
I get down at the club.

00:15:07.306 --> 00:15:08.474 line:95%,end
-Yes!
-(laughs)

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:10.075 line:95%,end
Hey, me, too.

00:15:10.142 --> 00:15:13.379 line:95%,end
Hey, Kel,
let's go grab a refreshment.

00:15:13.445 --> 00:15:15.948 line:95%,end
I would love to know
how we got this job because...

00:15:16.015 --> 00:15:16.982 line:95%,end
Oh, we're being punished.

00:15:17.049 --> 00:15:18.784 line:95%,end
...Melissa is the friendly one.

00:15:18.851 --> 00:15:20.286 line:95%,end
Mm.

00:15:20.352 --> 00:15:22.021 line:95%,end
Cheers to our new jobs.

00:15:22.087 --> 00:15:23.422 line:95%,end
Ooh, that's refreshing.

00:15:23.489 --> 00:15:25.391 line:95%,end
I'm afraid somebody's going
to walk in here that I know.

00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:29.061 line:95%,end
Like, what are you doing drinking
in the middle of the day?

00:15:29.128 --> 00:15:30.062 line:95%,end
Yeah.

00:15:32.631 --> 00:15:33.732 line:95%,end
Nobody will know any different.

00:15:33.799 --> 00:15:35.267 line:95%,end
It looks like iced tea.

00:15:35.334 --> 00:15:36.802 line:95%,end
Let's get these people out of here.

00:15:36.869 --> 00:15:38.103 line:95%,end
Hello!
Hello!

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:39.471 line:95%,end
Come here. Let's go.

00:15:39.538 --> 00:15:41.240 line:95%,end
Hello!

00:15:41.307 --> 00:15:44.209 line:95%,end
You guys look like the perfect
kind of people we're looking for.

00:15:44.276 --> 00:15:47.046 line:95%,end
Wouldn't you love to come
to a dance recital this weekend?

00:15:47.112 --> 00:15:48.881 line:95%,end
I'm actually a dancer, too, so...

00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:50.049 line:95%,end
KELLY: You are?

00:15:50.115 --> 00:15:51.550 line:95%,end
Have you auditioned
for anything lately?

00:15:51.617 --> 00:15:53.419 line:95%,end
Yeah, it's called,
"Naked boys Singing."

00:15:53.485 --> 00:15:56.689 line:95%,end
(laughs) I'm sorry.

00:15:58.257 --> 00:16:00.159 line:95%,end
It's really funny, ladies.

00:16:01.961 --> 00:16:03.562 line:95%,end
KELLY: We're out of flyers.

00:16:03.629 --> 00:16:04.630 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: We're out of flyers?

00:16:04.697 --> 00:16:06.465 line:95%,end
That must mean it's lunch time.

(laughter)

00:16:11.437 --> 00:16:13.806 line:5%,start
GIANNA: One line on the front line,
one line on the back line.

00:16:13.872 --> 00:16:15.274 line:95%,end
Hey, girls. How we doing?

00:16:15.341 --> 00:16:17.276 line:95%,end
Chloe, what's with the hair?

00:16:17.343 --> 00:16:18.544 line:95%,end
GIANNA: I told her four times.

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:20.813 line:95%,end
ABBY: You told her four times
to get it up?

00:16:20.879 --> 00:16:23.015 line:95%,end
Push ups, go. 25.

00:16:23.082 --> 00:16:24.917 line:95%,end
Can't listen to your teacher.

00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:27.186 line:95%,end
<i>Every dance studio has rules.</i>

00:16:27.252 --> 00:16:28.454 line:95%,end
Chloe broke the rules.

00:16:29.555 --> 00:16:30.923 line:95%,end
<i>Rules are for safety.</i>

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:33.659 line:95%,end
Safety for the dancer,
safety for those around her.

00:16:33.726 --> 00:16:35.260 line:95%,end
GIANNA: ...two,
straighten your bottom knee.

00:16:36.528 --> 00:16:39.698 line:95%,end
Every dancer knows
you come with your hair up to class.

00:16:41.567 --> 00:16:44.370 line:95%,end
You're not going to start turning again,
with your hair still down.

00:16:44.436 --> 00:16:45.371 line:95%,end
For real?

00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:51.043 line:95%,end
Leave the room, get the hair up,
and don't come back until it's up.

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:54.113 line:95%,end
(dramatic music playing)

00:16:58.917 --> 00:17:01.286 line:95%,end
ABBY: Chloe, here, pigtail holder.

00:17:01.353 --> 00:17:02.755 line:95%,end
Why didn't you open your mouth
and ask for it?

00:17:03.922 --> 00:17:05.424 line:95%,end
Ridiculous.

00:17:05.491 --> 00:17:07.960 line:95%,end
You could have asked for a rubber band
at the front desk. Right?

00:17:08.027 --> 00:17:10.829 line:95%,end
Why she was crying,
I don't know.

00:17:10.896 --> 00:17:12.931 line:95%,end
<i>Kids should cry</i>
<i>when their arm is broken</i>

00:17:12.998 --> 00:17:14.867 line:95%,end
and it's hanging off or somebody died.

00:17:14.933 --> 00:17:16.802 line:95%,end
That's it.

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:18.504 line:95%,end
We're working on turns
and it's taken you 20 minutes

00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:20.139 line:95%,end
to get your hair up.

00:17:23.742 --> 00:17:26.378 line:95%,end
<i>A Broadway talent scout</i>

I don't have time
to be nice and sweet.

00:17:33.619 --> 00:17:37.556 line:95%,end
We are turning these girls
into athletes, not pageant queens.

arabesque turn, six...

Look at you.

00:17:53.572 --> 00:17:56.809 line:95%,end
Let's go ahead and start
to recap what we did.

00:17:56.875 --> 00:17:58.444 line:5%,start
Me doing a two minute dance on stage

00:17:58.510 --> 00:17:59.778 line:5%,start
wasn't worth taking the heat.

00:17:59.845 --> 00:18:02.581 line:95%,end
<i>I stayed in</i>
<i>because I really thought about it,</i>

00:18:02.648 --> 00:18:05.117 line:95%,end
and I need to pick
my battles with Abby Miller.

00:18:05.184 --> 00:18:07.719 line:95%,end
I know that you guys
probably remember the combination.

00:18:07.786 --> 00:18:08.821 line:95%,end
Where is Holly?

00:18:08.887 --> 00:18:10.122 line:95%,end
CATHY: Where is Holly?

00:18:10.189 --> 00:18:13.025 line:5%,start
As we're starting
to go over our choreography,

00:18:13.092 --> 00:18:14.726 line:5%,start
I'm thinking
there's somebody missing.

00:18:14.793 --> 00:18:17.896 line:95%,end
And lo and behold,
Holly is not here.

00:18:17.963 --> 00:18:19.231 line:95%,end

-CATHY-Hi, Holly, this is--this is Cathy.

00:18:22.534 --> 00:18:25.370 line:95%,end
You know, I'm here for rehearsal
because we are dancing tomorrow night.

00:18:25.437 --> 00:18:28.073 line:95%,end
HOLLY: I am not going to be able
to perform.

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:30.442 line:5%,start
I will not be at the showcase
this weekend.

00:18:30.509 --> 00:18:33.112 line:95%,end
Cathy may not be happy about it,
but I'm graduating

00:18:33.178 --> 00:18:35.147 line:95%,end
and she's not the one
who's just earned her doctorate.

00:18:35.214 --> 00:18:38.450 line:95%,end
Listen, Holly, we really need
to keep you in this number. Okay?

00:18:38.517 --> 00:18:41.854 line:95%,end
Because you are, like,
the best at the walk.

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:44.623 line:95%,end
HOLLY: I'm just not going to be able
to make it.

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:47.025 line:95%,end
Holly is not dedicated to dance,

00:18:47.092 --> 00:18:48.994 line:95%,end
and I think
that it's very reflective

00:18:49.061 --> 00:18:50.562 line:95%,end
on the way that Nia dances.

00:18:50.629 --> 00:18:53.699 line:95%,end
How are we supposed to go on
if she's not here?

00:18:53.765 --> 00:18:55.467 line:95%,end
Do you guys realize
we're dancing tomorrow night?

00:18:59.771 --> 00:19:02.674 line:95%,end

it was really cool.

00:20:20.986 --> 00:20:21.820 line:95%,end
-So...
-(gasps)

00:20:21.887 --> 00:20:24.323 line:95%,end
...you know, you never know
when we're going to find that next star.

00:20:24.389 --> 00:20:26.625 line:5%,start
MADDIE: I think it's a big deal
because I would really like

00:20:26.692 --> 00:20:28.393 line:5%,start
to be on a Broadway show.

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:29.795 line:95%,end
MELISSA: You know
which one you're going to read?

00:20:29.861 --> 00:20:31.430 line:95%,end
The most important thing
is to be yourself.

00:20:31.496 --> 00:20:32.731 line:95%,end
And I know I shouldn't like it.

00:20:32.798 --> 00:20:34.066 line:95%,end
And I know
I shouldn't like it, but...

00:20:34.132 --> 00:20:36.335 line:95%,end
ABBY: It's understandable
that the children would be nervous.

00:20:36.401 --> 00:20:38.303 line:95%,end
This is a big time casting agent.

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:39.871 line:95%,end
<i>I mean, this is huge.</i>

00:20:39.938 --> 00:20:42.341 line:95%,end
For him to come to Pittsburgh
and be in my studio,

00:20:42.407 --> 00:20:43.709 line:95%,end
I was a nervous wreck.

00:20:43.775 --> 00:20:45.177 line:95%,end
An 8 and 1/2 by 11.

00:20:45.244 --> 00:20:47.312 line:95%,end
Your mom has her doctorate.
Measure it.

00:20:47.379 --> 00:20:50.382 line:95%,end
I specifically said don't bring me
an 8 and 1/2 by 11 piece of paper.

00:20:50.449 --> 00:20:53.685 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>Before the casting director came,</i>
<i>Abby just exploded.</i>

00:20:53.752 --> 00:20:55.887 line:5%,start
It just added
so much stress to everyone.

00:20:55.954 --> 00:20:58.156 line:5%,start
Everybody was nervous
about the audition to begin with,

00:20:58.223 --> 00:20:59.491 line:95%,end
and then she just flipped out.

00:20:59.558 --> 00:21:01.093 line:95%,end
So it just made everybody on edge.

00:21:01.159 --> 00:21:03.195 line:95%,end
My legs won't stop shaking.

00:21:07.165 --> 00:21:09.401 line:95%,end
All right, we're ready to begin!

00:21:09.468 --> 00:21:10.969 line:95%,end
-Let's go!
-CHRISTI: Chloe.

00:21:11.036 --> 00:21:14.006 line:95%,end
Abby made Chloe go in first
because she's her Guinea pig.

00:21:14.072 --> 00:21:15.374 line:95%,end
You know, she wanted her to go in.

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:18.043 line:95%,end
She wanted her to see
everything that went on

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:19.978 line:95%,end
so she could go out
and give the other kids notes.

00:21:20.045 --> 00:21:22.481 line:95%,end
Chloe, you're fine. Go!

00:21:22.547 --> 00:21:24.349 line:95%,end
Chloe, don't cry.

00:21:24.416 --> 00:21:26.084 line:95%,end
Stop crying.

00:21:30.522 --> 00:21:32.824 line:95%,end
-Hey, how are you?
-I'm good. How are you?

00:21:32.891 --> 00:21:34.059 line:95%,end
-Good. What's your name?
-Chloe.

00:21:34.126 --> 00:21:35.394 line:95%,end
Hey, Chloe.
Nice to meet you.

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:38.497 line:5%,start
I've never danced in front
of a Broadway agent before,

00:21:38.563 --> 00:21:41.066 line:95%,end
and I really want to do good
for Miss Abby and my mom.

00:21:41.133 --> 00:21:43.435 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:21:43.502 --> 00:21:45.570 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>I hope he does great</i>
<i>in front of the casting director.</i>

00:21:45.637 --> 00:21:49.141 line:95%,end
She has a--a cute personality,
you know, a talented dancer.

00:21:49.207 --> 00:21:52.110 line:95%,end
<i>But sometimes, you know,</i>
<i>when the pressure's on,</i>

00:21:52.177 --> 00:21:54.313 line:95%,end
<i>I have seen Chloe</i>
<i>either rise to the occasion</i>

00:21:54.379 --> 00:21:55.981 line:95%,end
or kind of crumble under the pressure.

00:21:56.048 --> 00:21:58.483 line:95%,end
So, you know,
it's always a tossup.

00:22:02.454 --> 00:22:04.356 line:95%,end
CESAR: Good job. Cool, Chloe.

00:22:04.423 --> 00:22:05.957 line:95%,end
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:22:06.024 --> 00:22:07.559 line:95%,end
ABBY: Nia, let's go.

00:22:07.626 --> 00:22:10.062 line:95%,end
NIA: <i>It's really scary</i>
<i>auditioning for the first time.</i>


00:22:10.128 --> 00:22:11.363 line:95%,end
I wish my mom were here.

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:13.031 line:95%,end
Do you sing?

00:22:13.098 --> 00:22:15.000 line:95%,end
A little bit.

00:22:15.067 --> 00:22:16.468 line:95%,end
<i>âª</i><i>Tomorrow</i><i>âª</i>

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:19.004 line:95%,end
Nah.

00:22:19.071 --> 00:22:21.573 line:5%,start
I was doing my best,
but I just got nervous.

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:24.543 line:95%,end
(ominous music playing)

00:22:28.947 --> 00:22:30.649 line:95%,end
No, stop. We can stop.
We can stop. We can stop.

00:22:30.716 --> 00:22:32.351 line:95%,end
We can stop.
Just stop. Yeah.

00:22:32.417 --> 00:22:35.487 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>Brooke and Paige</i>
<i>are performing in front of Cesar,</i>

00:22:35.554 --> 00:22:36.755 line:95%,end
<i>and I'm a nervous wreck.</i>

00:22:36.822 --> 00:22:38.957 line:95%,end
We have not had a lot
of time to prepare.

00:22:39.024 --> 00:22:40.559 line:95%,end
<i>Abby's on a rampage.</i>

00:22:40.625 --> 00:22:42.594 line:95%,end
I just hope that they're performing okay
for Cesar.

00:22:42.661 --> 00:22:44.296 line:95%,end
-Are you Paige's sister?
-Yes.

00:22:44.363 --> 00:22:45.831 line:95%,end
How is it dancing with your sister?

00:22:45.897 --> 00:22:47.466 line:95%,end
She gets rather annoying.

00:22:47.532 --> 00:22:48.500 line:95%,end
She does?

00:22:48.567 --> 00:22:49.568 line:95%,end
BROOKE: <i>I'm really nervous</i>

00:22:49.634 --> 00:22:52.037 line:5%,start
because he's a real
Broadway casting agent.

00:22:52.104 --> 00:22:54.106 line:95%,end
CESAR: Take a--
take a breath before you start.

00:22:54.172 --> 00:22:55.941 line:95%,end
BROOKE: If I see
one more brussels sprouts,

00:22:56.007 --> 00:22:57.642 line:95%,end
I'm never cleaning
my room again.

00:22:57.709 --> 00:22:58.777 line:95%,end
I'm going on strike.

00:22:58.844 --> 00:23:00.912 line:95%,end
Try to bring your eyes up more
so I--you can--I can make a--

00:23:00.979 --> 00:23:02.714 line:95%,end
so I can see you,
just because I--

00:23:02.781 --> 00:23:04.583 line:95%,end
this is what I'm seeing right now.

00:23:04.649 --> 00:23:07.452 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>I am very disappointed</i>
<i>in my girls at the audition.</i>

00:23:07.519 --> 00:23:09.521 line:95%,end
It should have been
a piece of cake for them.

00:23:09.588 --> 00:23:11.623 line:95%,end
But instead,
they got in there and acted

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:15.127 line:95%,end
like they had no idea
what they were doing in front of Cesar.

00:23:15.193 --> 00:23:18.130 line:95%,end
Listen to what I'm telling you.
And this is not Abby Lee Miller's problem,

00:23:18.196 --> 00:23:19.698 line:95%,end
this is your school teacher's problem.

00:23:19.765 --> 00:23:22.134 line:95%,end
You didn't read the sentence.

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.069 line:95%,end
Do you have
reading comprehension at school?

00:23:24.136 --> 00:23:26.571 line:95%,end
This is way beyond the realm
of dance teacher.

00:23:28.206 --> 00:23:30.909 line:95%,end
MELISSA: <i>Abby got mad at the girls</i>
<i>for the reading comprehension,</i>

00:23:30.976 --> 00:23:33.979 line:95%,end
but she always says
dance needs to come before school.

00:23:34.045 --> 00:23:36.681 line:95%,end
So I kept saying,
our girls don't even go to school.

00:23:36.748 --> 00:23:38.250 line:95%,end
They miss school
all the time for dance.

00:23:38.316 --> 00:23:40.218 line:95%,end
Mackenzie, you want to sing?
You're going to sing, honey.

00:23:40.285 --> 00:23:41.553 line:95%,end
-No!
-But honey, why?

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:43.355 line:95%,end
I don't want to sing!

00:23:43.422 --> 00:23:44.423 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Are you going to sing,
Mackenzie?

00:23:44.489 --> 00:23:45.991 line:95%,end
-No.
-Then go in the car.

00:23:46.057 --> 00:23:47.859 line:95%,end
-Get the keys, sit in the car.
-I don't want to go in the car.

00:23:47.926 --> 00:23:49.895 line:95%,end
But you're--
that's why we're here, to sing.

00:23:49.961 --> 00:23:52.297 line:95%,end
I spend all this money
for you to sing every week.

00:23:52.364 --> 00:23:53.698 line:95%,end
Uh-uh.

00:23:58.103 --> 00:23:58.970 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Come here.

00:23:59.037 --> 00:24:01.106 line:95%,end
You have to sing
or Abby's gonna flip out.

00:24:01.173 --> 00:24:02.874 line:95%,end
Oh, my God.

00:24:02.941 --> 00:24:03.942 line:95%,end
Mackenzie, come here.

00:24:04.009 --> 00:24:08.513 line:95%,end
Where is Vivi-Anne?
No matter what they ask you, yes.

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:10.348 line:95%,end
S--put the S on it.

00:24:10.415 --> 00:24:11.283 line:95%,end
-Let me hear it.
-Yes.

00:24:11.349 --> 00:24:12.784 line:95%,end
-Yes.
-ABBY: Yes.

00:24:12.851 --> 00:24:13.852 line:95%,end
Can you sing?

00:24:13.919 --> 00:24:15.086 line:95%,end
-Yes.
-ABBY: Can you dance?

00:24:15.153 --> 00:24:16.121 line:95%,end
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:24:16.188 --> 00:24:17.322 line:95%,end
CESAR: Hey, ladies.
How are you?

00:24:17.389 --> 00:24:19.858 line:95%,end
This is Mackenzie Ziegler,
and this is Vivi-Anne.

00:24:19.925 --> 00:24:21.393 line:95%,end
Hey, Mackenzie.

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:23.328 line:95%,end
Can I take your picture?

00:24:23.395 --> 00:24:24.696 line:95%,end
Have fun. Okay?

00:24:24.763 --> 00:24:27.766 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:24:34.072 --> 00:24:36.107 line:95%,end
CATHY: <i>I don't know</i>
<i>why everybody else was stressing.</i>

00:24:36.174 --> 00:24:37.843 line:95%,end
I thought that Vivi did great.

00:24:37.909 --> 00:24:40.045 line:95%,end
CESAR: I have a question.
Do either of you sing?

00:24:40.111 --> 00:24:41.880 line:95%,end
Mackenzie,
do you want to sing a little bit?

00:24:41.947 --> 00:24:43.014 line:95%,end
-ABBY: Yes.
-CESAR: No?

00:24:43.081 --> 00:24:44.716 line:95%,end
-ABBY: Yes.
-CESAR: You can sing anything.

00:24:44.783 --> 00:24:45.984 line:95%,end
If you don't want to sing,
you don't have to.

00:24:46.051 --> 00:24:47.319 line:95%,end
You don't want to?

00:24:47.385 --> 00:24:49.387 line:95%,end
Didn't we just have a little chat
in the other room

00:24:49.454 --> 00:24:52.090 line:95%,end
about if you--
he asks you anything you say yes?

00:24:52.157 --> 00:24:53.558 line:95%,end
I'll tell you what.

00:24:53.625 --> 00:24:56.461 line:95%,end
Your mother--her money
that she spends on voice lessons...

00:24:58.096 --> 00:25:00.932 line:95%,end
CESAR: Yeah, Abby, can--just--
I--I appreciate you bringing them in.

00:25:00.999 --> 00:25:02.734 line:95%,end
Just if you can step out,
just because they get nervous.

00:25:02.801 --> 00:25:04.269 line:95%,end
Next time I see you,
you're going to sing for me.

00:25:04.336 --> 00:25:06.071 line:95%,end
Right? You promise?

00:25:06.137 --> 00:25:08.106 line:95%,end
Here Mackenzie

00:25:14.312 --> 00:25:16.281 line:95%,end
to get voice lessons every week.

00:25:16.348 --> 00:25:18.183 line:95%,end
But, Kenz, we just went over
and you just sang it in there.

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:20.185 line:95%,end
-Vivi-Anne...
-MELISSA: No more.

00:25:20.252 --> 00:25:22.220 line:95%,end
I'm not paying for you to sing anymore.

00:25:22.287 --> 00:25:23.889 line:95%,end
I did a chin stand and it hurt.

00:25:23.955 --> 00:25:25.724 line:95%,end
Okay, Kenz.
Okay. Okay.

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:27.092 line:95%,end
Walk away from me, please.

I know you--I know you're nervous.

Just breathe. Breathe.
So don't be so nervous.

00:25:49.614 --> 00:25:51.182 line:95%,end
You just come in,

Absolutely not.

CATHY: Oh, my gosh!
Look at this place!

00:26:42.267 --> 00:26:43.335 line:95%,end
-This place is adorable!
-Hey!

00:26:43.401 --> 00:26:44.369 line:95%,end
How are you, honey?

00:26:44.436 --> 00:26:46.571 line:95%,end
CATHY: <i>Melissa's taking me</i>
<i>to a little boutique</i>

00:26:46.638 --> 00:26:49.641 line:95%,end
that has jewelry that we're going to be
able to use for our costumes.

00:26:49.708 --> 00:26:50.942 line:95%,end
-Do you own this place?
-I do.

00:26:51.009 --> 00:26:53.612 line:95%,end
Oh, my gosh.
You need to franchise it to Ohio.

00:26:53.678 --> 00:26:57.182 line:5%,start
I don't think that Melissa
is at my level of style,

00:26:57.248 --> 00:26:59.884 line:95%,end
but she's the only one
that volunteered

00:26:59.951 --> 00:27:01.519 line:95%,end
to go shopping with me today.

00:27:01.586 --> 00:27:03.321 line:95%,end
-We have costumes...
-Okay.

00:27:03.388 --> 00:27:04.823 line:95%,end
...for this recital that we're in.

00:27:04.889 --> 00:27:06.992 line:95%,end
So this is not just because it's going
to camouflage

00:27:07.058 --> 00:27:08.460 line:95%,end
-everybody's hips...
-Okay. Okay.

00:27:08.526 --> 00:27:10.996 line:95%,end
...you know, especially Christi,
because she's got a big butt. And...

00:27:11.062 --> 00:27:13.131 line:95%,end
(laughs)

00:27:13.198 --> 00:27:14.666 line:95%,end
She's not here
to defend herself.

00:27:14.733 --> 00:27:17.402 line:5%,start
I love her handbags
and I so love the way she dresses.

00:27:17.469 --> 00:27:19.537 line:5%,start
She looks so cute
every time I see her.

00:27:19.604 --> 00:27:20.639 line:95%,end
-That purse...
-This is really cute.

00:27:20.705 --> 00:27:21.673 line:95%,end
And look at this.
This looks like...

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:23.108 line:95%,end
-MELISSA: Yes.
-That looks like me.

00:27:23.174 --> 00:27:24.009 line:95%,end
MELISSA: That look--
totally looks like you.

00:27:24.075 --> 00:27:24.909 line:95%,end
This is really cute.

00:27:24.976 --> 00:27:27.145 line:95%,end
I am the handbag queen.

00:27:27.212 --> 00:27:29.014 line:95%,end
I need to stay in here
and look around, I really do.

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:30.015 line:95%,end
I know.
But we don't have time.

00:27:30.081 --> 00:27:31.416 line:95%,end
-I am--I adore bright...
-(gasps)

00:27:31.483 --> 00:27:32.851 line:95%,end
-You know what?
-Look at that.

00:27:32.917 --> 00:27:34.486 line:95%,end
I don't care
about the rehearsal right now.

00:27:34.552 --> 00:27:35.654 line:95%,end
-(laughs)
-I'd rather buy handbags.

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.789 line:95%,end
-Yay! We'll order one.
-CATHY: I'd rather buy handbags.

00:27:37.856 --> 00:27:40.525 line:95%,end
<i>I would say</i>
<i>next to the dance studio</i>

00:27:40.592 --> 00:27:43.328 line:95%,end
that shopping is, like,
my all time hobby.

00:27:43.395 --> 00:27:47.832 line:95%,end
When I'm shopping
with people and they're done,

00:27:47.899 --> 00:27:50.301 line:95%,end
I've got four more hours
to go in high heels.

00:27:50.368 --> 00:27:52.871 line:95%,end
My Bunco friends call me,
"the purse-whore."

00:27:52.937 --> 00:27:54.005 line:95%,end
(laughs)

00:27:54.072 --> 00:27:55.340 line:95%,end
Oh, my goodness!

00:27:57.042 --> 00:28:00.045 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:28:04.449 --> 00:28:06.918 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: We only have
a one number change.

00:28:06.985 --> 00:28:09.120 line:5%,start
<i>It's our annual Dance</i>
<i>Company Showcase,</i>

00:28:09.187 --> 00:28:10.922 line:5%,start
<i>and it's every mother's nightmare.</i>

00:28:10.989 --> 00:28:14.426 line:5%,start
This dress rehearsal in--
in the showcase, it's insane.

00:28:14.492 --> 00:28:15.593 line:95%,end
I mean, we're running
down the hallway.

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:17.729 line:95%,end
<i>Bobby pins are flying.</i>
<i>Kids are out of breath.</i>

00:28:17.796 --> 00:28:19.898 line:95%,end
People are frustrated and upset.
It's madness.

00:28:19.964 --> 00:28:22.133 line:95%,end
-Thanks.
-MELISSA: Losing it!

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.535 line:95%,end
ABBY: Okay. Places, girls.

00:28:23.601 --> 00:28:25.637 line:95%,end
Let's do this, again.

00:28:25.704 --> 00:28:28.740 line:95%,end
The Showcase week is really more
stressful than the competition

00:28:28.807 --> 00:28:32.444 line:95%,end
because everybody is doing every number.

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:34.312 line:95%,end
<i>We do a dress rehearsal all day</i>

00:28:34.379 --> 00:28:36.948 line:95%,end
<i>and during the dress rehearsal</i>
<i>I call the show.</i>

00:28:37.015 --> 00:28:38.550 line:95%,end
<i>I'm calling the curtains.</i>
<i>I'm calling the sound.</i>

00:28:38.616 --> 00:28:40.085 line:95%,end
<i>I'm calling the lights.</i>

00:28:40.151 --> 00:28:42.020 line:95%,end
<i>I'm calling you who enters, who exits.</i>

00:28:42.087 --> 00:28:43.254 line:95%,end
<i>So I sit up in the booth.</i>

00:28:43.321 --> 00:28:44.989 line:95%,end
<i>I watch the show from the top,</i>

00:28:45.056 --> 00:28:46.925 line:95%,end
and I control
everything that's going on.

00:28:46.991 --> 00:28:48.860 line:95%,end
And we have to stop
and start and stop and start

00:28:48.927 --> 00:28:50.195 line:95%,end
<i>to make sure it's right.</i>

00:28:50.261 --> 00:28:54.099 line:95%,end
If everybody's doing their job,
things go off without a hitch.

00:28:54.165 --> 00:28:55.800 line:95%,end
Christi, I need you in two minutes!

00:28:55.867 --> 00:28:57.602 line:95%,end
Can you tell me
how soon it is to "Honeybee?"

00:28:57.669 --> 00:28:59.204 line:95%,end
-Oh, please, don't do that.
-ABBY: No.

00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:02.407 line:95%,end
Stage left. Stage left.
Stage left. Go.

00:29:02.474 --> 00:29:03.641 line:95%,end
Maybe not.

00:29:05.076 --> 00:29:07.078 line:5%,start
Okay. Come on, girls.

00:29:08.179 --> 00:29:10.381 line:5%,start
I am behind schedule already.

00:29:10.448 --> 00:29:12.484 line:95%,end
You need to be on stage, ready to go.

00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:14.652 line:95%,end
That's what a call time is,
ready to dance,

00:29:14.719 --> 00:29:17.388 line:95%,end
hair and makeup,
not just walking in the door.

00:29:17.455 --> 00:29:18.990 line:95%,end
Yes?

00:29:19.057 --> 00:29:20.492 line:95%,end
Nia, where is your mother?

00:29:20.558 --> 00:29:21.559 line:95%,end
She's at work.

00:29:21.626 --> 00:29:24.329 line:95%,end
CATHY: Abby,
she's been at work all weekend

00:29:24.395 --> 00:29:26.765 line:95%,end
and she's not dancing today
in the mom's dance.

00:29:26.831 --> 00:29:28.833 line:95%,end
-She's not?
-No.

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:30.602 line:95%,end
Cathy, I know you're upset.

00:29:30.668 --> 00:29:32.804 line:95%,end
I'm a little upset
because I had to repaginate,

00:29:32.871 --> 00:29:36.608 line:95%,end
and I'm not sure
that we are totally comfortable with it.

00:29:36.674 --> 00:29:38.576 line:95%,end
-Well...
-CATHY: I have a brilliant idea.

00:29:38.643 --> 00:29:40.311 line:95%,end
-Would you please do the honors...
--No.

00:29:40.378 --> 00:29:41.780 line:95%,end
...and dance with--oh, come on.

00:29:41.846 --> 00:29:43.281 line:95%,end
-Oh, come on.
-MELISSA: Come on, Abby!

00:29:43.348 --> 00:29:45.483 line:95%,end
No. Actually,
insurance-wise, I can't.

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:48.386 line:95%,end
There was no way
that I could have stepped on stage

00:29:48.453 --> 00:29:51.289 line:95%,end
and then still cued everybody
for what they needed to do.

00:29:51.356 --> 00:29:54.793 line:95%,end
Plus, I don't do my own choreography
let alone somebody else's.

00:29:54.859 --> 00:29:57.662 line:95%,end
And, remember,
we have an agent in the audience.

00:29:57.729 --> 00:29:59.764 line:95%,end
So if you think you were fabulous,

00:29:59.831 --> 00:30:01.833 line:95%,end
then be fabulous again.

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:05.336 line:95%,end
If you weren't fabulous,
let him see what you can do.

00:30:05.403 --> 00:30:08.006 line:95%,end
MELISSA: <i>I'm so excited</i>
<i>that the casting agent from New York</i>

00:30:08.072 --> 00:30:09.140 line:95%,end
<i>is here to see Maddie.</i>

00:30:09.207 --> 00:30:11.476 line:95%,end
<i>I think that she's going to blow him away.</i>

00:30:11.543 --> 00:30:13.344 line:95%,end
<i>And maybe he'll see me</i>
<i>in the mom dance</i>

00:30:13.411 --> 00:30:15.613 line:95%,end
and cast us in something together.

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:16.714 line:95%,end
(laughs)

00:30:16.781 --> 00:30:19.417 line:95%,end
Safety first, and no bare feet.

00:30:23.087 --> 00:30:25.089 line:5%,start

Center!

<i>that can't be beat</i><i>âª</i>

00:30:37.268 --> 00:30:39.204 line:95%,end
I'm really freaked out
about these because they're...

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:40.104 line:95%,end
A mess?

00:30:40.171 --> 00:30:41.673 line:95%,end
Oh, my God, they're a mess.

00:30:41.739 --> 00:30:44.609 line:95%,end
<i>Abby told us that the girls</i>
<i>in the "Sugar Daddies" dance</i>


00:30:44.676 --> 00:30:47.212 line:95%,end
<i>needed to have</i>
<i>a lollipop as a prop.</i>

00:30:47.278 --> 00:30:50.348 line:5%,start
And it was an issue
from the get-go.

00:30:50.415 --> 00:30:53.218 line:95%,end
She gave us something
that was awful to work with.

00:30:53.284 --> 00:30:54.485 line:95%,end
They kept breaking.

Can you hold
that right there for a second?

00:31:11.836 --> 00:31:14.205 line:95%,end
See, if we had--if we had straight pins,
we could pin that in.

00:31:14.272 --> 00:31:17.342 line:5%,start
As far as being the studio owner
of Candy Apples Dance Center,

00:31:17.408 --> 00:31:21.012 line:5%,start
we would never,
ever go to dress rehearsal,

00:31:21.079 --> 00:31:24.148 line:95%,end
let alone the performance,
and our props would not be done.

00:31:24.215 --> 00:31:26.584 line:95%,end
They are done weeks beforehand.

00:31:26.651 --> 00:31:29.487 line:95%,end
ABBY: Can you send the people
that are doing the props up to me

00:31:29.554 --> 00:31:31.623 line:95%,end
so I make sure
they're doing the right thing?

00:31:31.689 --> 00:31:34.192 line:5%,start
And I am sick
and tired of policing them

00:31:34.259 --> 00:31:35.627 line:5%,start
about every little thing.

00:31:35.693 --> 00:31:37.662 line:5%,start
Can't their mothers
do anything right?

00:31:37.729 --> 00:31:39.964 line:95%,end
Where--where is the adult
in this situation?

00:31:40.031 --> 00:31:43.401 line:95%,end
You know, guys, everybody thinks
I'm the one at the last minute.

00:31:43.468 --> 00:31:44.903 line:95%,end
These have been done.

00:31:44.969 --> 00:31:47.205 line:95%,end
I told your children to take them
on Friday night

00:31:47.272 --> 00:31:48.806 line:95%,end
and pitch in and get them done.

00:31:48.873 --> 00:31:50.541 line:95%,end
<i>All I need these mothers to do</i>

Easy, right?

00:31:56.681 --> 00:31:58.049 line:95%,end
No, not with these mothers.

00:31:58.116 --> 00:31:59.150 line:95%,end
It's always something.

Everybody's worked really hard.

This is the Showcase.

00:32:15.033 --> 00:32:18.202 line:95%,end
You know what I need you to rotate

<i>But then having a Broadway agent</i>
<i>in the audience,</i>

00:32:30.548 --> 00:32:32.517 line:95%,end
it's like, my head's going to explode.

00:32:32.583 --> 00:32:34.419 line:95%,end
I just want my kids

00:40:18.482 --> 00:40:21.685 line:95%,end
And I don't know,
what did you say?

00:40:21.752 --> 00:40:23.721 line:95%,end
You said you're not upset but it hurts.

00:40:23.788 --> 00:40:25.423 line:95%,end
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

00:40:25.489 --> 00:40:26.924 line:95%,end
-Thank you.
-Great. You looked beautiful on stage.

00:40:26.991 --> 00:40:28.526 line:95%,end
--Thank you.
-CESAR: Thanks.

MELISSA: <i>I knew Cesar would love her.</i>
<i>It's kind of a given.</i>

00:40:30.494 --> 00:40:31.762 line:95%,end
<i>And she has a cute</i>

00:40:31.829 --> 00:40:32.763 line:95%,end

Christi is jealous
of my eight-year-old daughter,

00:40:35.065 --> 00:40:36.700 line:5%,start
and I think it's totally ridiculous.

00:40:36.767 --> 00:40:38.102 line:5%,start
<i>It's because my kid is the star.</i>

00:40:38.169 --> 00:40:40.004 line:5%,start
<i>She is the most talented girl there,</i>

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:42.773 line:5%,start
<i>and Abby knows that she has a future.</i>

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:44.708 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: <i>I don't know how much longer</i>
<i>I can put up with Abby.</i>

00:40:44.775 --> 00:40:47.511 line:5%,start
<i>The whole Broadway casting agent thing</i>
<i>was total bull (bleep).</i>

00:40:47.578 --> 00:40:49.146 line:5%,start
We all know
why this guy came in.

00:40:49.213 --> 00:40:51.649 line:5%,start
And it was for her precious little Maddie,
no one else.

00:40:51.715 --> 00:40:54.585 line:5%,start
<i>I might have agreed to play</i>
<i>by Abby's dumb little rules,</i>

00:40:54.652 --> 00:40:55.853 line:5%,start
<i>but no more.</i>

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:57.988 line:5%,start
I'm not keeping my mouth shut,
and it's on.

00:40:58.055 --> 00:40:59.056 line:5%,start
CESAR: Thank you.
Congratulations.

00:40:59.123 --> 00:41:00.357 line:5%,start
MELISSA: Thank you.
It was nice to meet you.

00:41:00.424 --> 00:41:02.126 line:5%,start
CESAR: Nice to meet you, too.
Nice to meet you, Maddie.
