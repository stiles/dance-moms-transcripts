Vivi-Anne, you're going to do a solo

00:00:03.636 --> 00:00:04.904 line:5%,start
in the competition this weekend.

00:00:04.971 --> 00:00:06.639 line:5%,start
Vivi was uncomfortable

00:00:06.706 --> 00:00:08.875 line:5%,start
with the solo that we worked on,

00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:12.579 line:5%,start
so we are going to go ahead
and do a piece that she already knows.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.714 line:5%,start
KELLY: <i>Brooke's hip</i>
<i>has been bothering her,</i>

00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:17.017 line:5%,start
<i>so I decided to take her</i>
<i>to a chiropractor.</i>

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:18.785 line:5%,start
I really don't think
that it's a good thing for her

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:20.153 line:5%,start
to be competing this week.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.121 line:5%,start
We have to.

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:22.756 line:5%,start
-(sobbing)
-Why are you crying now?

00:00:22.822 --> 00:00:24.224 line:5%,start
ABBY: <i>Coming up on </i>Dance Moms...

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.892 line:5%,start
Since we're in Pittsburgh this weekend,

00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:28.128 line:5%,start
I'm going to give
every single one of you a solo.

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:29.396 line:5%,start
Did you know Maddie's doing two solos?

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:30.797 line:5%,start
She has double the chance of winning.

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:32.332 line:5%,start
KELLY: <i>Maddie had a lot of practice,</i>

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.801 line:5%,start
<i>but not all of us</i>
<i>have private lesson time slots.</i>

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:37.270 line:5%,start
ABBY: <i>That has happened to me in 25 years.</i>

00:00:37.337 --> 00:00:38.271 line:5%,start
<i>It's humiliating.</i>

00:00:38.338 --> 00:00:40.073 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: <i>I am so fed up with the BS.</i>

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.374 line:5%,start
-Get out of here now.
-Let's go.

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:43.109 line:5%,start
She is holding a national title

00:00:43.176 --> 00:00:44.511 line:5%,start
and I will take it away in a minute.

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:46.212 line:5%,start
That (bleep) bitch.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.382 line:95%,end

ABBY: <i>Let's talk about</i>
<i>Starbound Competition.</i>

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:07.167 line:5%,start
Can we have round of applause?

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:09.002 line:5%,start
-Whoo-hoo.
-(applause)

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:11.638 line:5%,start
Okay, so Brooke,

00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:12.839 line:5%,start
you blew them away.

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:15.842 line:5%,start
The people sitting around me were in awe

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:17.610 line:95%,end
when you did your handstand twist.

00:01:17.677 --> 00:01:20.680 line:95%,end
(cheers and applause)

00:01:21.714 --> 00:01:23.650 line:95%,end
But why all the drama

00:01:23.716 --> 00:01:25.251 line:95%,end
with the hip? Hmm?

00:01:25.318 --> 00:01:27.520 line:95%,end
If you are seriously injured,

00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:28.888 line:95%,end
you don't need to go to your mother

00:01:28.955 --> 00:01:30.223 line:95%,end
and get everybody worked up.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.491 line:95%,end
You come to me,

00:01:31.558 --> 00:01:33.793 line:95%,end
and that needs to be clear, yes?

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.296 line:5%,start
Abby's comment about
Brooke crying about her,

00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:37.831 line:5%,start
had been complaining that it hurt,

00:01:37.897 --> 00:01:38.731 line:95%,end
<i>I thought was crazy.</i>

00:01:38.798 --> 00:01:40.800 line:95%,end
<i>If Brooke's hurt, she should come to me.</i>

00:01:40.867 --> 00:01:42.435 line:95%,end
<i>If she didn't complain about it</i>

00:01:42.502 --> 00:01:44.604 line:95%,end
<i>and we didn't put ice and stuff on it,</i>

00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:46.639 line:95%,end
she probably wouldn't have been able
to perform the dance.

00:01:47.574 --> 00:01:50.076 line:95%,end
I want to talk
about this week's competition.

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:53.880 line:95%,end
This week's competition
is Onstage New York,

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:55.648 line:95%,end
right here in our hometown,

00:01:55.715 --> 00:01:57.383 line:95%,end
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.486 line:95%,end
This is one competition

00:01:59.552 --> 00:02:03.890 line:95%,end
where we cannot have anything go wrong.

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:06.059 line:95%,end
All of my peers will be here.

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:08.928 line:95%,end
All of my competitors will be here.

00:02:08.995 --> 00:02:11.164 line:95%,end
All of my enemies will be here.

00:02:12.098 --> 00:02:14.067 line:95%,end
Do you see there's somebody new on top?

00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:16.436 line:95%,end
Yes. Brooke, you are here

00:02:16.503 --> 00:02:17.904 line:95%,end
because of your performance.

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:19.172 line:95%,end
You worked through an injury.

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.106 line:95%,end
You did what you had to do.

00:02:20.173 --> 00:02:21.074 line:95%,end
You were a team player.

00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:22.575 line:5%,start
It feels good to be on top of the pyramid,

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:24.344 line:5%,start
but I don't really care.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.445 line:95%,end
Like, it doesn't matter to me

00:02:25.512 --> 00:02:27.046 line:95%,end
whether I'm on the bottom or the top.

00:02:27.113 --> 00:02:29.215 line:95%,end
You are getting a solo this weekend.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.285 line:95%,end
All right, Chloe, Maddie,

00:02:32.352 --> 00:02:34.621 line:95%,end
you are also getting solos this weekend.

00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:36.122 line:95%,end
The bottom row,

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:37.891 line:95%,end
what am I supposed to do with you four?

00:02:37.957 --> 00:02:39.025 line:95%,end
You need to step it up.

00:02:39.092 --> 00:02:40.994 line:95%,end
You need to get your butts
back in the class

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.795 line:95%,end
and start working on your technique.

00:02:42.862 --> 00:02:43.763 line:95%,end
And you know what?

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.131 line:95%,end
Since we're in Pittsburgh this weekend,

00:02:45.198 --> 00:02:47.433 line:95%,end
I'm going to give
every single one of you a solo.

00:02:47.767 --> 00:02:50.537 line:95%,end
(applause)

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:52.372 line:95%,end
CATHY: <i>I wasn't clapping</i>

00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:53.806 line:5%,start
because I knew

00:02:53.873 --> 00:02:56.176 line:5%,start
that we were going
to have to do the bee dance.

00:02:56.242 --> 00:02:58.244 line:95%,end
<i>She has not mastered that solo yet,</i>

00:02:58.311 --> 00:03:00.914 line:95%,end
and I know that Vivi is very uncomfortable

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.182 line:95%,end
with new choreography.

00:03:02.248 --> 00:03:03.683 line:95%,end
Moms, it's going to be a busy week.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.385 line:95%,end
I expect them to be amazing.

00:03:05.451 --> 00:03:06.619 line:95%,end
Do you understand?

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:08.054 line:95%,end
Yes? Sit up straight.

00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:09.622 line:95%,end
Ladies, let's go.

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:11.324 line:95%,end
<i>Competing locally in Pittsburgh</i>

00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:12.458 line:95%,end
is always important.

00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:15.562 line:95%,end
<i>It's a big deal because my name</i>
<i>and my reputation are on the line.</i>

00:03:15.628 --> 00:03:17.397 line:5%,start
<i>So we have a lot of work to do.</i>

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:22.202 line:5%,start
It's like you're dancing
out of control a little bit.

00:03:22.268 --> 00:03:23.736 line:5%,start
You need to bring it down.

00:03:23.803 --> 00:03:24.704 line:5%,start
Yes.

00:03:24.771 --> 00:03:26.372 line:5%,start
And if everything's big,

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:27.707 line:5%,start
then nothing's big.

00:03:27.774 --> 00:03:28.608 line:95%,end
<i>This week,</i>

00:03:28.675 --> 00:03:30.810 line:95%,end
each girl has a solo to perform.

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:32.111 line:95%,end
<i>Solos are very difficult</i>

00:03:32.178 --> 00:03:33.546 line:95%,end
<i>because there's nobody to hide</i>

00:03:33.613 --> 00:03:34.914 line:95%,end
<i>behind out there on stage.</i>

00:03:34.981 --> 00:03:36.115 line:95%,end
It's all about you.

00:03:36.683 --> 00:03:38.084 line:95%,end
<i>I love solo work.</i>

00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:41.387 line:95%,end
<i>I love the one on one work</i>
<i>with the student.</i>

00:03:41.454 --> 00:03:44.657 line:95%,end
<i>I think every child grows</i>
<i>from doing a solo.</i>

00:03:44.724 --> 00:03:47.393 line:95%,end
Watch all the way on that heel
on that jete.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.929 line:95%,end
(slow music playing)

ABBY: <i>This week,</i>

00:03:50.997 --> 00:03:52.732 line:95%,end
Maddie is doing two solos,

one to the music <i>Cry,</i>

00:03:54.267 --> 00:03:56.135 line:95%,end
which she competed several weeks ago,

00:03:56.202 --> 00:03:58.371 line:95%,end
and the other is a new tap routine.

00:04:02.742 --> 00:04:04.377 line:95%,end
MADDIE: <i>I love having a solo,</i>

00:04:04.444 --> 00:04:07.013 line:5%,start
and I think I do the best
when I'm dancing alone.

00:04:08.014 --> 00:04:09.482 line:95%,end
I'm going to put the music on

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.684 line:95%,end
and I want to see you do it, okay?

00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:14.754 line:5%,start

Push hard.

00:04:19.792 --> 00:04:21.494 line:95%,end
Kick it up. Get it up.

00:04:21.561 --> 00:04:25.331 line:95%,end
I am not happy with Vivi doing this
"Bumblebee" dance this week.

00:04:25.398 --> 00:04:27.700 line:95%,end
<i>So being a dance teacher,</i>
<i>I just kind of took it upon myself</i>

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:29.636 line:95%,end
<i>to say, hey, you know,</i>
<i>let's get together in a little room</i>

00:04:29.702 --> 00:04:31.204 line:95%,end
<i>and let's rehearse the dance.</i>

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:34.540 line:95%,end
But she doesn't want to jump
on to a new dance.

00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:35.541 line:95%,end
I don't want to.

00:04:35.608 --> 00:04:36.542 line:95%,end
Come here.

00:04:37.076 --> 00:04:38.645 line:95%,end
-Don't want to anymore.
-(chuckles) Don't be mad at me.

00:04:38.711 --> 00:04:40.113 line:95%,end
You make me keep doing this.

00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:41.981 line:95%,end
-What?
-Don't want to dance anymore.

00:04:42.048 --> 00:04:43.783 line:95%,end
All right, don't be upset.

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.184 line:95%,end
Don't be upset.

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:48.187 line:95%,end
Okay, don't be upset.

00:04:48.988 --> 00:04:50.823 line:95%,end
All right, let's do it again.

00:04:53.826 --> 00:04:55.194 line:95%,end
ABBY: Up to your shoulders.

00:04:56.763 --> 00:04:58.031 line:5%,start
More turn onto the passe.


00:04:58.097 --> 00:04:59.032 line:5%,start
Easy.

00:04:59.098 --> 00:05:00.266 line:95%,end
Do that again. Stand up.

00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:02.535 line:95%,end
Paige's solos is primarily jazz

00:05:02.602 --> 00:05:04.804 line:95%,end
with a few gymnastic tumbling passes.

00:05:04.871 --> 00:05:06.773 line:95%,end
Those are good feet. Good.

PAIGE: <i>This is my first time doing a solo,</i>

00:05:08.574 --> 00:05:09.976 line:5%,start
and I'm really scared

00:05:10.043 --> 00:05:12.812 line:5%,start
'cause I'm going to be out on stage
all by myself.

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:14.414 line:95%,end
Get in forced arch.

00:05:14.881 --> 00:05:15.882 line:95%,end
Good girl.

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:17.650 line:95%,end
It's scarier when you're alone

00:05:17.717 --> 00:05:20.086 line:95%,end
because if you mess up on stage,

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:22.889 line:95%,end
you don't really have anyone
to look at or anything.

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:26.793 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>Come on. Slide on that Jete.</i>

00:05:26.859 --> 00:05:27.727 line:95%,end
<i>Point your feet.</i>

<i>Legs together.</i>

WOMAN: <i>Iced tea, no lemon.</i>

00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:37.503 line:95%,end
And this one a regular Pepsi.

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:38.738 line:95%,end
That's me.

00:05:38.805 --> 00:05:40.673 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>(indistinct) is a place</i>
<i>that we can go</i>

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.242 line:5%,start
and just kind of get out
of that dance jail.

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:45.044 line:95%,end
<i>This time, we invited Cathy to come along</i>

00:05:45.111 --> 00:05:46.212 line:95%,end

we were including her and things.

So what did you guys think
of the competition this weekend?

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:52.452 line:95%,end
It was far away,

too far away.

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:55.521 line:95%,end
I mean, we sat there.
At least we got to go home.

00:05:55.588 --> 00:05:56.723 line:95%,end
You're right, I did.

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:57.890 line:95%,end
All right, guys,

00:05:57.957 --> 00:05:59.726 line:95%,end
-we will see you later.
-Are you leaving?

00:05:59.792 --> 00:06:01.394 line:95%,end
-Yes, we're leaving.
-(overlapping chatter)

00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:03.129 line:95%,end
We all came here early to watch her.

00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:05.331 line:95%,end
(indistinct chatter)

00:06:05.765 --> 00:06:07.100 line:95%,end
Yeah, that wasn't fair.

00:06:07.166 --> 00:06:08.000 line:95%,end
Well, you know what?

00:06:08.067 --> 00:06:09.969 line:95%,end
This is how I feel about that, ladies.

00:06:10.036 --> 00:06:11.871 line:95%,end
We're in this for a different reason

00:06:11.938 --> 00:06:14.173 line:95%,end
and we don't need to have a jury section,

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.175 line:95%,end
and we probably will be leaving

00:06:16.242 --> 00:06:18.211 line:95%,end
at the competitions. I'm sorry.

00:06:18.277 --> 00:06:19.212 line:95%,end
That's upsetting for us

00:06:19.278 --> 00:06:20.880 line:95%,end
because I think we all care

00:06:20.947 --> 00:06:23.049 line:95%,end
-about the kids and those dancers.
-Yeah.

00:06:23.116 --> 00:06:26.519 line:95%,end
Yeah. I--and if you don't want us
to be cheerleaders, that's fine,

00:06:26.586 --> 00:06:28.688 line:95%,end
but I like supporting the other kids.

00:06:28.755 --> 00:06:31.924 line:95%,end
When you say, "I like that,"
that's you're like.

00:06:31.991 --> 00:06:33.426 line:95%,end
It's not my like.

<i>I don't want to be a part of the team.</i>

00:06:35.595 --> 00:06:37.363 line:95%,end
I don't want to have to be a cheerleader.

When Vivi's done dancing,

00:06:38.998 --> 00:06:39.932 line:95%,end
I want to go home

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:41.267 line:95%,end

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.775 line:95%,end
shopping, even.

00:06:48.841 --> 00:06:50.777 line:95%,end
This is just not working well with me.

00:06:50.843 --> 00:06:52.245 line:95%,end
I like you guys,

00:06:52.311 --> 00:06:54.080 line:95%,end

Cool. Straight knee, front.

00:07:14.066 --> 00:07:15.034 line:95%,end
Breathe.

00:07:15.668 --> 00:07:17.637 line:95%,end
I like to dance, but I like to hang out

00:07:19.338 --> 00:07:20.873 line:95%,end

Nia, what's going on with your legs?

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.748 line:95%,end
<i>Oh, yes, I'm brutally honest.</i>

00:07:28.815 --> 00:07:30.116 line:95%,end
I have to be.

00:07:30.183 --> 00:07:31.517 line:95%,end
That leg, yes?

00:07:31.584 --> 00:07:32.585 line:95%,end
Do it again.

This is my job.

00:07:39.025 --> 00:07:40.226 line:95%,end
This is what I do.

00:07:41.527 --> 00:07:42.762 line:95%,end
I don't know why
you're leaning in the heels,

00:07:42.829 --> 00:07:43.663 line:95%,end

Why are you so sloppy?

00:07:49.902 --> 00:07:51.938 line:95%,end
Why is that foot hanging
on the ground? Come on.

00:07:52.004 --> 00:07:53.739 line:95%,end
Well, she always helps me,

00:07:53.806 --> 00:07:55.608 line:95%,end

00:07:55.675 --> 00:07:57.376 line:95%,end

00:07:57.443 --> 00:07:59.946 line:95%,end

Wiggle.

Move to the back.

What are you doing?

00:08:20.266 --> 00:08:22.068 line:95%,end
I just forgot.

ABBY: What?

00:08:23.302 --> 00:08:24.337 line:95%,end
You forgot?

00:08:24.837 --> 00:08:25.771 line:95%,end
But you have to keep going.

00:08:25.838 --> 00:08:27.306 line:95%,end
You can't just quit dancing.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:28.941 line:95%,end
All right, start again.

00:08:29.408 --> 00:08:31.611 line:95%,end

stay home and eat chips.

Turn it out.

Slow down.

You know, I appreciate all of
the camaraderie and everything,

00:08:53.933 --> 00:08:54.901 line:95%,end
I think the different system--

00:08:54.967 --> 00:08:56.636 line:95%,end

going to offend you, Christi--

I am Abby's colleague,

I think she's really a sweet person

00:09:09.849 --> 00:09:11.350 line:95%,end

Abby's making a ton of money
off of me, ladies.

She's making a ton of money off
of all of us.

Well, she's probably making
a lot more off of me

00:09:18.991 --> 00:09:21.193 line:95%,end

getting charged double.

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:25.925 line:95%,end

<i>is probably Maddie</i>

<i>Maddie gets two solos</i>

all year from September to June,
once a week,

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:45.578 line:95%,end
<i>and there's where she learns</i>

How do you practice
your dance without music?

00:11:22.915 --> 00:11:23.949 line:95%,end
Well, Melissa's
in charge of music.

00:11:24.016 --> 00:11:25.551 line:95%,end
Isn't that ironic?

00:11:25.618 --> 00:11:26.585 line:95%,end
Yeah.

00:12:06.592 --> 00:12:07.660 line:95%,end
That's not the point.

00:12:07.727 --> 00:12:09.695 line:95%,end
That's not how we're
learning to pick up quickly.

00:12:09.762 --> 00:12:11.163 line:95%,end
So this week,

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:13.799 line:95%,end
I made sure I pulled that kid out
of the dressing room,

00:12:13.866 --> 00:12:15.668 line:95%,end
<i>I put that bumblebee costume on her.</i>

00:12:15.735 --> 00:12:19.305 line:95%,end
I had her run that routine
over and over and over

00:12:19.371 --> 00:12:21.373 line:95%,end
so that that mother
could not change it.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:24.910 line:95%,end
Oh, that fits you beautifully.

00:12:24.977 --> 00:12:27.513 line:5%,start
I don't like makeup and costumes.

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.349 line:95%,end
SINGER: <i>âª Tastes so sweet</i>

00:12:30.416 --> 00:12:32.551 line:95%,end
<i>âª You now that's something</i>
<i>that can't be beat âª</i>

00:12:32.618 --> 00:12:34.720 line:95%,end
-I'll let you get back to work.
-Okay, thank you.

00:12:34.787 --> 00:12:35.788 line:95%,end
Bye.

00:12:37.156 --> 00:12:38.858 line:95%,end
Sashay. SautÃ©.

00:12:38.924 --> 00:12:40.893 line:95%,end
Oh, what do we have on?

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.027 line:95%,end
ABBY: Point, point.

00:12:42.094 --> 00:12:45.664 line:95%,end
CATHY: <i>If she is insistent that Vivi have</i>
<i>to do this "Bumblebee" dance,</i>

00:12:45.731 --> 00:12:48.300 line:5%,start
I will certainly
reimburse her for her time

00:12:48.367 --> 00:12:50.870 line:95%,end
<i>and we may not</i>
<i>even be at the competition.</i>

00:12:52.037 --> 00:12:53.172 line:95%,end
Do you want to see?

00:12:53.239 --> 00:12:54.840 line:95%,end
I would love to see.

00:12:54.907 --> 00:12:56.842 line:95%,end
It's your time to show
mom that you can do this.

00:12:56.909 --> 00:12:58.677 line:95%,end
She doesn't have
any faith in you.

00:12:58.744 --> 00:13:00.579 line:95%,end
<i>Cathy underestimates Vivi-Anne.</i>

00:13:00.646 --> 00:13:02.181 line:95%,end
<i>She does not push her.</i>

00:13:02.248 --> 00:13:03.582 line:95%,end
<i>I think owning a studio,</i>

00:13:03.649 --> 00:13:06.252 line:95%,end
<i>she does not want it to be</i>
<i>all about her daughter.</i>

00:13:06.318 --> 00:13:07.820 line:95%,end
She does not want
to lose customers.

00:13:07.887 --> 00:13:09.588 line:95%,end
But in the process,

00:13:09.655 --> 00:13:12.892 line:95%,end
<i>the child isn't where</i>
<i>she should be, technically,</i>

00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.994 line:95%,end
<i>and that's why</i>
<i>she's bringing her to me.</i>

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:17.196 line:95%,end
And that's my job
and that's what I'm going to do.

00:13:17.263 --> 00:13:18.364 line:95%,end
She just needs to butt out.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:21.834 line:95%,end
Good girl.

00:13:23.502 --> 00:13:24.703 line:95%,end
(indistinct)

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:26.372 line:95%,end
Oh, ye of little faith.

00:13:26.438 --> 00:13:29.074 line:95%,end
The situation with Cathy
is very bizarre.

00:13:29.141 --> 00:13:32.278 line:95%,end
<i>Cathy really wants nothing</i>
<i>to do with the ALDC team.</i>


00:13:32.344 --> 00:13:33.379 line:95%,end
She really doesn't.

00:13:33.445 --> 00:13:35.614 line:95%,end
I need you to be a role model.

00:13:35.681 --> 00:13:36.982 line:95%,end
You're a dance teacher.

00:13:37.049 --> 00:13:38.918 line:95%,end
You know how important it is
to get these mothers to do--

00:13:38.984 --> 00:13:40.820 line:95%,end
Abby, I cannot ride a bus,

00:13:40.886 --> 00:13:42.188 line:95%,end
if this is where this is going.

00:13:42.855 --> 00:13:44.924 line:95%,end
The attitude
that I'm too good for the bus,

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:46.592 line:95%,end
no, that has to stop.

00:13:46.659 --> 00:13:48.928 line:95%,end
I can't do these field trips, I'm sorry.

00:13:48.994 --> 00:13:50.129 line:95%,end
But that's part of the team.

00:13:50.196 --> 00:13:51.163 line:95%,end
-You want her to be--
-I can't.

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:52.264 line:95%,end
Then let her go by herself.

00:13:52.331 --> 00:13:53.599 line:95%,end
-Okay. Okay.
-That's fine.

00:13:53.666 --> 00:13:55.167 line:95%,end
Vivi comes with me, that's fine.

00:13:55.234 --> 00:13:56.902 line:95%,end
-Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
-You don't have to go.

00:13:56.969 --> 00:13:58.604 line:95%,end
We're not going
to do that either.

00:13:58.671 --> 00:14:00.472 line:95%,end
I don't like not being in control.

00:14:00.539 --> 00:14:03.075 line:95%,end
<i>I'm being told what I have to do,</i>
<i>where I have to go,</i>

00:14:03.142 --> 00:14:04.844 line:95%,end
<i>and this is just not</i>
<i>sitting well with me.</i>

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:06.679 line:95%,end
But we want to arrive
together as a team.

00:14:06.745 --> 00:14:09.348 line:95%,end
Why do we have to do that?
Are we part of the Olympics?

00:14:11.717 --> 00:14:13.252 line:95%,end
Cathy, why are you here?

00:14:13.319 --> 00:14:15.588 line:95%,end
You're here to be part
of the Abby Lee Dance Company,

00:14:15.654 --> 00:14:16.889 line:95%,end
but you don't want
to play the game.

00:14:16.956 --> 00:14:18.257 line:95%,end
I know, I don't.

00:14:18.324 --> 00:14:19.692 line:95%,end
This is how I feel, Abby.

00:14:19.758 --> 00:14:22.228 line:95%,end
They should be
focused on themselves

00:14:22.294 --> 00:14:23.963 line:95%,end
and we'll be focused
on ourselves.

00:14:24.029 --> 00:14:25.631 line:95%,end
ABBY: I know, but that's selfish

00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:27.733 line:95%,end
and I'm not trying
to raise selfish children.

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:28.701 line:95%,end
We live in America.

00:14:28.767 --> 00:14:31.537 line:95%,end
I feel like I'm in jail
that I have to jump on a bus

00:14:31.604 --> 00:14:34.240 line:95%,end
and ride with everybody
like I'm an elementary student.

00:14:34.306 --> 00:14:35.241 line:95%,end
I set my rules.

00:14:35.307 --> 00:14:37.343 line:95%,end
If you don't like them,
go somewhere else.

00:14:37.409 --> 00:14:38.978 line:95%,end
I don't care.

00:14:39.044 --> 00:14:40.613 line:95%,end
We're doing your solo this week.

00:14:40.679 --> 00:14:41.947 line:95%,end
I'm very pleased
with what I saw.

00:14:42.014 --> 00:14:44.250 line:95%,end
The costume is just as hideous
as I thought it was.

00:14:44.316 --> 00:14:45.818 line:95%,end
-Sorry. Sorry.
-Why would you say that to me?

00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:47.219 line:95%,end
Why would I create
a hideous costume?

00:14:47.286 --> 00:14:48.354 line:95%,end
I'm sorry.

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:49.622 line:95%,end
Okay, I got to go.

00:14:49.688 --> 00:14:51.257 line:95%,end
So we're going
to get the address

00:14:51.323 --> 00:14:55.027 line:95%,end
to meet you at the venue
this weekend and all is good.

00:14:55.094 --> 00:14:56.462 line:95%,end
You're going to go
look up the address.

00:14:56.528 --> 00:14:57.463 line:95%,end
-Okay.
-And we'll meet you.

00:14:59.398 --> 00:15:02.668 line:5%,start
(dramatic music playing)

00:15:02.735 --> 00:15:03.669 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: <i>Well, go ahead.</i>

00:15:03.736 --> 00:15:04.703 line:5%,start
You guys can start eating.

00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:05.871 line:5%,start
I know everybody's starving.

00:15:05.938 --> 00:15:08.274 line:5%,start
I decided to have all
the moms over for lunch

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:11.710 line:95%,end
because I thought that it was important
that we come together as a group

00:15:11.777 --> 00:15:13.178 line:95%,end
and talk about Cathy

00:15:13.245 --> 00:15:15.714 line:95%,end
and sort of what her intentions were
at our studio.

00:15:15.781 --> 00:15:18.017 line:95%,end
All right, girls, I asked you
to come over here

00:15:18.083 --> 00:15:21.720 line:95%,end
because I think we need
to talk about Cathy.

00:15:21.787 --> 00:15:24.990 line:95%,end
If she's going to benefit
from being a member of the team,

00:15:25.057 --> 00:15:27.226 line:95%,end
then she needs to get
her ass on the bus.

00:15:27.293 --> 00:15:30.296 line:95%,end
She needs to stay
and support my kid

00:15:30.362 --> 00:15:31.997 line:95%,end
-at 9 o'clock at night.
-HOLLY: All the kids.

00:15:32.064 --> 00:15:33.432 line:95%,end
If we have to abide
by Abby's rules,

00:15:33.499 --> 00:15:35.000 line:95%,end
everyone has to abide
by Abby's rules.

00:15:35.067 --> 00:15:37.269 line:95%,end
Because if you start making
exceptions to the rules,

00:15:37.336 --> 00:15:38.904 line:95%,end
then why have rules?

00:15:38.971 --> 00:15:39.905 line:95%,end
Exactly.

00:15:39.972 --> 00:15:42.141 line:95%,end
MELISSA: <i>I understood the concern</i>
<i>of the other mothers.</i>

00:15:42.207 --> 00:15:44.810 line:5%,start
I kind of feel caught in the middle
because I really like Cathy a lot.

00:15:44.877 --> 00:15:48.714 line:95%,end
I guess the other issue
is to level the playing field.

00:15:48.781 --> 00:15:50.950 line:95%,end
Would you be willing
to pull one of Maddie's solos?

00:15:51.016 --> 00:15:52.284 line:95%,end
I don't know about that.

00:15:52.351 --> 00:15:54.286 line:95%,end
I have to talk
to Maddie about that.

00:15:54.353 --> 00:15:57.056 line:95%,end
<i>Christi asked me to pull</i>
<i>one of Maddie's solos.</i>

00:15:57.122 --> 00:15:58.657 line:95%,end
<i>I thought it was</i>
<i>very inappropriate.</i>

00:15:58.724 --> 00:16:01.627 line:95%,end
Maddie gets two solos
because she has a tap private,

00:16:01.694 --> 00:16:03.929 line:95%,end
so she has a tap solo every year

00:16:03.996 --> 00:16:06.065 line:95%,end
and then Abby just gives her
an extra solo.

00:16:06.131 --> 00:16:08.834 line:95%,end
<i>I don't see why wouldn't be</i>
<i>fair for my daughter doing two solos.</i>

00:16:08.901 --> 00:16:10.169 line:95%,end
I don't think I would do that

00:16:10.235 --> 00:16:11.503 line:95%,end
because I don't think you
guys would do that.

00:16:12.271 --> 00:16:13.605 line:95%,end
I did do it.

00:16:13.672 --> 00:16:15.341 line:95%,end
-I did it this year. Yes, I did.
-This year?

00:16:15.407 --> 00:16:16.575 line:95%,end
I did it at DEA.

00:16:16.642 --> 00:16:17.977 line:95%,end
I could have had Chloe compete
and didn't.

00:16:18.043 --> 00:16:18.911 line:95%,end
Why not?

00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:21.947 line:95%,end
Because Paige and Nia
deserved a chance to shine.

00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:24.016 line:95%,end
I have to think about that.

00:16:24.083 --> 00:16:25.217 line:95%,end
I have to talk
to my daughter about that.

00:16:25.284 --> 00:16:26.852 line:95%,end
What would be
your reasons for not doing it?

00:16:26.919 --> 00:16:28.520 line:95%,end
Because I'm not going
to hurt my daughter.

00:16:28.587 --> 00:16:31.223 line:5%,start
Maddie, by far, is one
of the strongest dancers.

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:32.891 line:5%,start
There's no question about that.

00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:35.194 line:95%,end
<i>There's no need for her to have</i>
<i>two solos to prove</i>

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:36.895 line:95%,end
<i>that she's a really strong dancer.</i>

00:16:36.962 --> 00:16:38.130 line:95%,end
<i>We know that.</i>

00:16:38.197 --> 00:16:40.733 line:95%,end
If you looked at it
from our perspective,

00:16:40.799 --> 00:16:42.968 line:95%,end
you would be upset
if Chloe were doing two solos

00:16:43.035 --> 00:16:44.570 line:95%,end
and Maddie only had
a chance to do one.

00:16:44.636 --> 00:16:45.904 line:95%,end
I would not.

00:16:45.971 --> 00:16:48.307 line:95%,end
If another mom
had their child in two solos,

00:16:48.374 --> 00:16:50.542 line:95%,end
I would never go to that mom
and ask them to pull

00:16:50.609 --> 00:16:51.844 line:95%,end
<i>one of their daughter's solos.</i>

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:54.513 line:95%,end
It's really none of my business
what their daughter is doing.

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:57.549 line:95%,end
I have to worry about my children,
not their children.

00:16:57.616 --> 00:16:58.684 line:95%,end
It's coming very cutthroat

00:16:58.751 --> 00:17:00.452 line:95%,end
and I don't think
it needs to be that way.

00:17:01.253 --> 00:17:02.654 line:95%,end
I don't want to discuss it.

00:18:01.647 --> 00:18:03.649 line:95%,end
and Paige still hadn't
heard the music.

00:18:03.715 --> 00:18:05.651 line:95%,end
All right, well if Abby comes out at all,

00:18:05.717 --> 00:18:08.087 line:95%,end
can you just tell her
that I need to talk to her?

00:18:08.153 --> 00:18:08.987 line:95%,end
Yes.

00:18:09.054 --> 00:18:10.155 line:95%,end
ABBY: Go.

00:18:10.222 --> 00:18:11.290 line:95%,end
Good, Nic.

00:18:11.957 --> 00:18:12.825 line:95%,end
Push.

00:18:12.891 --> 00:18:14.493 line:5%,start
When we don't have
music to rehearse to,

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:17.296 line:5%,start
we have to use counts,
like five, six, seven, eight.

00:18:17.362 --> 00:18:19.798 line:95%,end
But it's not as fun
when we don't have music.

00:18:20.899 --> 00:18:22.434 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Now we're doing acro?

00:18:22.501 --> 00:18:24.369 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Yes, can you believe it?

00:18:24.436 --> 00:18:27.206 line:95%,end
We are supposed
to be competing new solos,

00:18:27.272 --> 00:18:30.175 line:95%,end
and she needs to get these kids
who are dancing this weekend

00:18:30.242 --> 00:18:31.477 line:95%,end
to rehearse their solos.

00:18:31.543 --> 00:18:33.178 line:95%,end
-It's 7:30.
-HOLLY: I know.

00:18:33.245 --> 00:18:35.647 line:95%,end
It's the night
before our competition.

00:18:35.714 --> 00:18:37.683 line:95%,end
Ooh, that was scary, Kennedy.

00:18:37.749 --> 00:18:39.318 line:95%,end
Straighten your legs.

00:18:39.384 --> 00:18:41.320 line:95%,end
I'm in the middle
of teaching an acrobatic class.

00:18:41.386 --> 00:18:45.023 line:95%,end
<i>The mothers were not confident</i>
<i>in their children, which saddens me.</i>

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:46.725 line:95%,end
I have more faith
in their kids than they do.

00:18:46.792 --> 00:18:49.528 line:95%,end
<i>They want that kid to practice,</i>
<i>practice, practice on their solos</i>

00:18:49.595 --> 00:18:51.029 line:95%,end
<i>that they're</i>
<i>going to get on stage</i>

00:18:51.096 --> 00:18:53.098 line:95%,end
<i>and do for two minutes</i>
<i>and 30 seconds</i>

00:18:53.165 --> 00:18:56.001 line:95%,end
instead of learning
how to dance.

00:18:56.068 --> 00:18:58.370 line:95%,end
Then they could learn
a combination like that

00:18:58.437 --> 00:19:00.072 line:95%,end
and then get on stage
and perform it.

00:19:00.139 --> 00:19:03.275 line:95%,end
So obviously, she's not
going to perform very well

00:19:03.342 --> 00:19:06.612 line:95%,end
when she's the youngest age
in the category and she has no music.

00:19:06.678 --> 00:19:08.547 line:95%,end
And she hasn't had
any super secret privates.

00:19:08.614 --> 00:19:09.548 line:95%,end
Exactly.

00:19:09.615 --> 00:19:13.185 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>I absolutely think that Maddie</i>
<i>got more time than anybody.</i>

00:19:13.252 --> 00:19:15.187 line:5%,start
She got those extra
rehearsal times in there.

00:19:15.254 --> 00:19:16.555 line:5%,start
ABBY: Good.

00:19:16.622 --> 00:19:20.058 line:5%,start
I work really hard,
and that sometimes makes me tired,

00:19:20.125 --> 00:19:22.094 line:95%,end
<i>but that doesn't</i>
<i>stop me from dancing.</i>

00:19:22.161 --> 00:19:24.329 line:95%,end
When are we going to start
running dances and get started?

00:19:24.396 --> 00:19:26.031 line:95%,end
ABBY: Get that weight
into your left shoulder.

00:19:26.098 --> 00:19:28.033 line:95%,end
I think everybody's
ready to do their solos.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.737 line:95%,end
<i>Paige does not have her music,</i>
<i>but her solo looks great.</i>

00:19:31.803 --> 00:19:32.838 line:95%,end
You know what, guys?

00:19:32.905 --> 00:19:33.972 line:95%,end
This is ridiculous.

00:19:34.706 --> 00:19:36.542 line:95%,end
I'm going down
and getting Paige

00:19:36.608 --> 00:19:38.877 line:95%,end
and telling her to run her solo
with Emma.

00:19:38.944 --> 00:19:40.179 line:95%,end
Good.

00:19:40.245 --> 00:19:41.446 line:95%,end
And then pull Brooke in after,

00:19:41.513 --> 00:19:43.815 line:95%,end
and then put Nia in,
and I'll bring up the rear.

00:19:43.882 --> 00:19:45.417 line:95%,end
-I like that attitude.
-KELLY: Ridiculous.

00:19:47.219 --> 00:19:49.154 line:95%,end
Melissa, can I have
Paige's music?

00:19:49.221 --> 00:19:50.322 line:95%,end
It's downloading.

00:19:50.389 --> 00:19:51.823 line:95%,end
It's been downloading
for 14 minutes.

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:53.025 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>I mean, Paige is 10.</i>

00:19:53.091 --> 00:19:55.794 line:5%,start
She needs to run
her dance to her music.

00:19:55.861 --> 00:19:59.097 line:5%,start
<i>And it was Friday night,</i>
<i>8 o'clock,</i>


00:19:59.164 --> 00:20:01.099 line:95%,end
and I still had
no music for Paige,

00:20:01.166 --> 00:20:02.768 line:95%,end
and we were competing
the next morning.

00:20:02.834 --> 00:20:04.603 line:95%,end
This wireless is so slow.

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:06.038 line:95%,end
Still three minutes. God.

00:20:06.104 --> 00:20:08.207 line:95%,end
Everything
is always so last minute.

00:20:08.273 --> 00:20:10.642 line:95%,end
-She's teaching acro.
-MELISSA: I don't know.

00:20:10.709 --> 00:20:13.011 line:95%,end
KELLY: And since when do we do
a five-hour acro class

00:20:13.078 --> 00:20:14.646 line:95%,end
the night before competition?

00:20:14.713 --> 00:20:16.548 line:95%,end
Hiding in there
doing an acro class.

00:20:16.615 --> 00:20:18.350 line:95%,end
-MELISSA: Who's hiding?
-CHRISTI: Abby, because she knows

00:20:18.417 --> 00:20:20.219 line:95%,end
that our kids need to rehearse.

00:20:20.285 --> 00:20:23.288 line:95%,end
My daughter rehearsed
with her private today with Matt.

00:20:23.355 --> 00:20:24.790 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: But at least
she got to rehearse.

00:20:24.856 --> 00:20:27.125 line:95%,end
Well, I have a standing
private every week, so.

00:20:27.192 --> 00:20:28.894 line:95%,end
I'm still waiting
for Paige's music.

00:20:28.961 --> 00:20:31.163 line:95%,end
You guys don't realize
what I do for your kids.

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:33.098 line:95%,end
-I mean, I work.
-No one's saying

00:20:33.165 --> 00:20:34.032 line:95%,end
you don't do for the kids,

00:20:34.099 --> 00:20:36.902 line:95%,end
but we also know
that there are things

00:20:36.969 --> 00:20:38.370 line:95%,end
that our kids
don't benefit from, either.

00:20:38.437 --> 00:20:40.072 line:95%,end
Because I mean,
just throwing the cards on the table.

00:20:40.138 --> 00:20:43.742 line:5%,start
Typically, when there's
a conflict or a confrontation,

00:20:43.809 --> 00:20:45.744 line:95%,end
<i>Melissa has</i>
<i>a tendency to deflect.</i>

00:20:45.811 --> 00:20:48.380 line:95%,end
Melissa always
has something else

00:20:48.447 --> 00:20:51.016 line:95%,end
that she's willing to talk about
that's not the topic

00:20:51.083 --> 00:20:52.451 line:95%,end
that she wants to talk about.

00:20:52.517 --> 00:20:54.386 line:95%,end
And when we go
to competitions,

00:20:54.453 --> 00:20:56.622 line:95%,end
Gianna is like
your own personal helper.

00:20:56.688 --> 00:20:58.156 line:95%,end
But she would do anything
for any of the kids

00:20:58.223 --> 00:20:59.291 line:95%,end
-because she loves the girls.
-But she doesn't.

00:20:59.358 --> 00:21:00.592 line:95%,end
She only does it for Maddie.

00:21:00.659 --> 00:21:03.428 line:95%,end
The point is we need our kids
out of that room

00:21:03.495 --> 00:21:04.796 line:95%,end
and in B, running their dances.

00:21:04.863 --> 00:21:06.064 line:95%,end
(sighs) Please.

00:21:06.131 --> 00:21:07.899 line:95%,end
I just feel that the moms

00:21:07.966 --> 00:21:11.169 line:95%,end
<i>don't like me because my daughter</i>
<i>is a great dancer</i>

00:21:11.236 --> 00:21:13.438 line:95%,end
<i>and they kind</i>
<i>of hold that against me.</i>

00:21:13.505 --> 00:21:15.607 line:95%,end
They don't realize
what I do behind the scenes.

00:21:15.674 --> 00:21:17.209 line:95%,end
<i>If they didn't have</i>
<i>me at the studio,</i>

00:21:17.276 --> 00:21:18.644 line:95%,end
things wouldn't get done.

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:20.078 line:95%,end
<i>It's just how they are.</i>

00:21:20.145 --> 00:21:21.446 line:95%,end
<i>They're just little bitches.</i>

00:21:22.147 --> 00:21:23.615 line:95%,end
Her music's ready.

00:21:25.584 --> 00:21:26.952 line:95%,end
I'm so sick of this.

00:21:27.019 --> 00:21:28.854 line:95%,end
I'm sick of them saying,
oh, it's all about Maddie.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:29.988 line:95%,end
-It's all about Maddie.
-What's--

00:21:30.055 --> 00:21:31.156 line:95%,end
Maddie's in class.

00:21:31.223 --> 00:21:33.125 line:95%,end
-They all want to learn their solos.
-ABBY: No.

00:21:33.191 --> 00:21:34.793 line:95%,end
MELISSA: <i>I work my ass off</i>
<i>for these mothers</i>

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:36.695 line:95%,end
<i>and all they do is bitch at me.</i>

00:21:36.762 --> 00:21:39.031 line:95%,end
This is it for me.
I'm sick of them.

00:21:39.998 --> 00:21:41.967 line:5%,start
These mothers are going
to be the death of me.

00:21:42.034 --> 00:21:44.336 line:95%,end
I run their daughter's numbers
between classes.

00:21:44.403 --> 00:21:47.105 line:95%,end
<i>They just need to trust me</i>
<i>and let me do my job.</i>

00:21:47.172 --> 00:21:48.340 line:95%,end
Are they going to be able

00:21:48.407 --> 00:21:50.442 line:95%,end
to continue running their solos
with you, Abby?

00:21:50.509 --> 00:21:53.745 line:95%,end
ABBY: Maddie had a half hour
private with Matt (indistinct)

00:21:53.812 --> 00:21:55.180 line:95%,end
her tap teacher today.

00:21:55.247 --> 00:21:56.915 line:95%,end
Chloe came in today.

00:21:56.982 --> 00:21:58.450 line:95%,end
Emma worked with her.

00:21:58.517 --> 00:22:00.385 line:95%,end
But she's learning
a whole new dance.

00:22:00.452 --> 00:22:02.521 line:95%,end
All the moms
are like in a tizzy

00:22:02.587 --> 00:22:04.456 line:95%,end
because they don't have
their solo rehearsal time.

00:22:04.523 --> 00:22:06.258 line:95%,end
They don't have the
right solo music.

00:22:06.325 --> 00:22:08.827 line:95%,end
<i>Like, Chloe learned a new routine,</i>

00:22:08.894 --> 00:22:10.028 line:95%,end
and her mother's, oh my God.

00:22:10.095 --> 00:22:11.963 line:95%,end
She's the only one that has
a new routine, new routine.

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:12.964 line:95%,end
BS.

00:22:13.031 --> 00:22:15.734 line:95%,end
There's no way
that because she ran it twice

00:22:16.668 --> 00:22:17.803 line:95%,end
to new music

00:22:17.869 --> 00:22:19.971 line:95%,end
that she's going to be able
to compete on Saturday.

00:22:20.038 --> 00:22:21.239 line:95%,end
I'm worried about that.

00:22:21.306 --> 00:22:25.110 line:95%,end
Everybody in town is going
to this particular competition,

00:22:25.177 --> 00:22:27.679 line:95%,end
so I want my best foot forward.

00:22:27.746 --> 00:22:29.481 line:95%,end
They need to have faith
in their daughters

00:22:29.548 --> 00:22:30.949 line:95%,end
and faith in my training.

00:22:31.016 --> 00:22:33.318 line:95%,end
I didn't just fall off
the turnip truck, you know.

00:22:33.385 --> 00:22:35.020 line:95%,end
I've been doing this
for 25 years.

00:22:35.087 --> 00:22:36.888 line:95%,end
Is this preparation
for an audition?

00:22:36.955 --> 00:22:37.789 line:95%,end
Yes.

00:22:37.856 --> 00:22:39.624 line:95%,end
Is this good for all of them?

00:22:39.691 --> 00:22:40.759 line:95%,end
Absolutely.

00:22:42.094 --> 00:22:42.994 line:95%,end
All right.

00:22:46.498 --> 00:22:47.866 line:95%,end
Still not rehearsing.

Hi, Brookie.

00:23:01.847 --> 00:23:03.448 line:95%,end
<i>These are important</i>

<i>Abby's kids win,</i>

00:23:05.917 --> 00:23:06.785 line:95%,end

more kids from this.

00:23:08.954 --> 00:23:10.122 line:95%,end
Come on, get a seat.

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:18.397 line:5%,start
technique, precision, performance,

00:23:18.463 --> 00:23:19.564 line:5%,start

Maddie had a lot of practice

privates every week,

00:39:38.342 --> 00:39:39.777 line:95%,end
-Why? Why are you doing this?
-Let's go in the hallway.

00:39:39.844 --> 00:39:42.146 line:95%,end
I'm not going anywhere.
My daughter's happy.

00:39:42.213 --> 00:39:44.782 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Let's go in the hallway.
Do you want to talk about all

00:39:44.849 --> 00:39:46.517 line:95%,end
the things that need to be talked about?

00:39:46.584 --> 00:39:47.551 line:95%,end
Not here, not now.

00:39:47.618 --> 00:39:50.154 line:95%,end
Because you won't talk about it
and you won't talk about it.

00:39:50.221 --> 00:39:51.889 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I won't ever talk to you again.

00:39:51.956 --> 00:39:52.923 line:95%,end
(interposing voices)

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:55.526 line:95%,end
You're making my daughter cry, so shut up.

00:39:55.593 --> 00:39:59.196 line:95%,end
And how many times did my daughter
beat your daughter this year.

00:39:59.263 --> 00:40:00.097 line:95%,end
(bleep).

00:40:00.164 --> 00:40:02.266 line:95%,end
We were stacked against
everybody this weekend

00:40:02.333 --> 00:40:03.634 line:95%,end
because you didn't.

00:40:03.701 --> 00:40:04.602 line:95%,end
Get out of here now.

00:40:04.668 --> 00:40:05.770 line:95%,end
-Let's go.
-Bitch.

00:40:05.836 --> 00:40:06.904 line:95%,end
Let's go.

00:40:06.971 --> 00:40:09.974 line:95%,end
Your kids feel bad, but it doesn't matter
that my daughter feels bad.

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:11.876 line:95%,end
Your daughter is holding a national title

00:40:11.942 --> 00:40:13.511 line:95%,end
and I will take it away in a minute.

00:40:13.577 --> 00:40:15.613 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Go ahead and take it away.
I'll leave your studio.

00:40:15.679 --> 00:40:17.915 line:95%,end
ABBY: That's fine.
Where are you going to go?

00:40:17.982 --> 00:40:20.184 line:95%,end
HOLLY: <i>I would say the fight</i>
<i>between Abby and Christi</i>

00:40:20.251 --> 00:40:21.552 line:95%,end
<i>was incredibly embarrassing.</i>

00:40:21.619 --> 00:40:23.687 line:95%,end
<i>That could've been handled</i>
<i>behind closed doors,</i>

00:40:23.754 --> 00:40:25.322 line:95%,end
<i>definitely not in front of children.</i>

00:40:25.389 --> 00:40:27.558 line:5%,start
Even with our issues,
I try to limit the things

00:40:27.625 --> 00:40:29.260 line:5%,start
that I'm saying in front of the kids

00:40:29.326 --> 00:40:30.661 line:5%,start
because it makes them feel bad.

00:40:30.728 --> 00:40:32.430 line:95%,end
It makes them feel
self-conscious and awkward.

00:40:32.496 --> 00:40:33.964 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Now, come with me.

00:40:34.031 --> 00:40:36.267 line:95%,end
Girls, they are staying with me.

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:39.103 line:95%,end
You are uneducated mess.

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:40.538 line:95%,end
Quit drinking.

00:40:41.972 --> 00:40:43.841 line:95%,end
I'm not going on that (bleep) bitch.

00:40:43.908 --> 00:40:45.309 line:95%,end
-That (bleep) bitch.
-Don't cry.

00:40:45.376 --> 00:40:46.210 line:95%,end
Don't cry.

00:40:46.277 --> 00:40:47.111 line:95%,end
I'm telling you.

00:40:47.178 --> 00:40:48.245 line:95%,end
Give me a phone.

00:40:48.312 --> 00:40:51.515 line:95%,end
-CHRISTI: No, she didn't even do--
-You are out of control.

00:40:51.582 --> 00:40:54.452 line:95%,end
I'm (bleep) at your studio.

00:40:54.518 --> 00:40:56.554 line:95%,end
-There you go.
-Then I need to leave.

00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:57.788 line:95%,end
You're done.

00:41:00.391 --> 00:41:01.392 line:95%,end
Congratulations.

00:41:01.459 --> 00:41:02.927 line:95%,end
ABBY: Thank you, sir.

00:41:02.993 --> 00:41:04.094 line:95%,end
Thank you very much.

00:41:07.765 --> 00:41:09.366 line:95%,end
How did I get stuck in this?

00:41:12.536 --> 00:41:15.539 line:5%,start
(upbeat music playing)
