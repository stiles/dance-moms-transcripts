ABBY: <i>This is national,</i>

00:00:03.636 --> 00:00:05.271 line:5%,start
there's no more second chances.

00:00:05.338 --> 00:00:06.172 line:5%,start
This is it.

00:00:06.239 --> 00:00:07.540 line:5%,start
We need to learn a new group for team.

00:00:07.607 --> 00:00:09.776 line:5%,start
We have to do it today, and there's props.

00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:11.745 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: Chloe Told me
that she wants to put dance.

00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:14.114 line:5%,start
ABBY: If she wants to quit,
I have a whole list of people

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.348 line:5%,start
that want to take her spot.

00:00:15.415 --> 00:00:18.318 line:5%,start
KELLY: Maddie wins,
because she's with two choreographers

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:20.520 line:5%,start
<i>who work with her seven days a week.</i>

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:21.788 line:5%,start
I will do everything possible

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:24.224 line:5%,start
for my daughter
to leave your studio next year.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.227 line:5%,start
The top junior group winner

00:00:27.293 --> 00:00:31.264 line:5%,start
is by the Abby-Lee Dance Company!

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:32.699 line:5%,start
We're going to Hollywood!

00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.534 line:5%,start
(squealing)

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:36.269 line:5%,start
ABBY: <i>Here we are in Hollywood again.</i>

00:00:36.336 --> 00:00:38.905 line:5%,start
<i>The girls auditioning for the music video.</i>

00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:42.008 line:5%,start
<i>For all of my students,</i>
<i>this is the biggest opportunity</i>

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:43.410 line:5%,start
<i>they have ever had in their career.</i>

00:00:43.476 --> 00:00:46.946 line:5%,start
I would say hip hop is the most difficult
of choreography to get.

00:00:47.013 --> 00:00:47.847 line:5%,start
Listen to me.

00:00:47.914 --> 00:00:49.382 line:5%,start
ABBY: You cannot act like this and cry,

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:51.751 line:5%,start
because you become difficult to work with.

00:00:51.818 --> 00:00:55.055 line:5%,start
GIRL: I'm the one that always really
practices have to dance studio,

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:56.222 line:5%,start
because it's a big deal.

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:57.123 line:5%,start
I'm done!

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.892 line:5%,start
HOLLY: Excuse me. Don't talk to me
that way. That's the first thing.

00:00:58.958 --> 00:00:59.793 line:5%,start
-I'm just saying--I'm done.
-Melissa.

ABBY: <i>Ready, girls? Let's go.</i>

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:21.214 line:95%,end
Come on in.

00:01:21.981 --> 00:01:24.717 line:95%,end
Well, you thought you were going home
after Lake Tahoe.

00:01:25.318 --> 00:01:27.554 line:95%,end
And here we are back in LA.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.722 line:95%,end
I have a big surprise. It's very exciting.

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:33.326 line:95%,end
Before I get into that,
you notice there's no pyramid.

00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:34.227 line:95%,end
Yes?

00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:35.929 line:95%,end
(applause)

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.135 line:95%,end
ABBY: Everybody's in a straight line
because here in LA...

00:01:42.202 --> 00:01:43.503 line:95%,end
it's not really about the talent.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:44.838 line:95%,end
It's about the look.

00:01:44.904 --> 00:01:47.540 line:95%,end
<i>The girls have some hard lessons</i>
<i>to learn here in Hollywood.</i>

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:51.077 line:5%,start
It doesn't matter how well you dance,
how well you sing,

00:01:51.144 --> 00:01:52.312 line:95%,end
how well you act.

00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:54.247 line:95%,end
If you're not the look that they need,

00:01:54.314 --> 00:01:57.050 line:95%,end
and you're not the package
that they're searching for,

00:01:57.117 --> 00:01:58.184 line:95%,end
you're not gonna get the job.

00:01:58.251 --> 00:02:01.654 line:95%,end
I'm ready to talk a little bit
about this surprise.

00:02:01.721 --> 00:02:03.256 line:95%,end
This is LA.

00:02:03.323 --> 00:02:06.960 line:95%,end
The best people in the world come here.

00:02:07.026 --> 00:02:09.195 line:95%,end
They're all vying for the same job.

00:02:09.262 --> 00:02:10.930 line:95%,end
Everybody wants to be a star.

00:02:12.532 --> 00:02:15.535 line:95%,end
You are going to get
the opportunity to audition

00:02:15.602 --> 00:02:17.971 line:95%,end
for a major music video.

00:02:18.037 --> 00:02:20.273 line:95%,end
(screaming)

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.976 line:5%,start
MELISSA: In LA, I think this is,
like, the big deal

00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:25.211 line:95%,end
<i>that Maddie has a chance</i>
<i>to be in a music video.</i>

00:02:25.278 --> 00:02:27.247 line:95%,end
<i>She'll do great.</i>
<i>She really enjoys auditioning.</i>

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:28.281 line:95%,end
<i>That's her thing.</i>

00:02:28.348 --> 00:02:29.716 line:95%,end
I don't know who's going to get it.

00:02:29.782 --> 00:02:31.084 line:95%,end
I don't know if all of you
are going to get it

00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:32.252 line:95%,end
or just some of you.

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:33.720 line:95%,end
It's not up to me.

00:02:33.786 --> 00:02:35.255 line:95%,end
I don't make the decisions.

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:37.590 line:95%,end
So it's every man for himself.

00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:39.759 line:95%,end
Tomorrow, instead of a rehearsal,

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:41.427 line:95%,end
we will be having a class.

00:02:41.494 --> 00:02:42.962 line:95%,end
I'm going to teach a hip hop combination,

00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:44.998 line:95%,end
since that audition
is going to be in hip hop.

00:02:46.132 --> 00:02:48.868 line:95%,end
ABBY: This week is a whole new
ball game for the girls.

00:02:48.935 --> 00:02:50.670 line:95%,end
It's not a competition.

00:02:50.737 --> 00:02:52.105 line:95%,end
It's not about your costume.

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:54.073 line:95%,end
It's not an awards ceremony.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.308 line:95%,end
That's all gone.

00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:57.844 line:95%,end
This is a real-life,
professional experience.

00:02:57.911 --> 00:02:58.978 line:95%,end
This is Hollywood.

00:02:59.045 --> 00:03:01.481 line:95%,end
They can chew up and spit you out,

00:03:01.548 --> 00:03:04.017 line:95%,end
or they can make all
your dreams come true.

00:03:04.083 --> 00:03:05.051 line:95%,end
It just depends.

00:03:05.118 --> 00:03:06.986 line:95%,end
You have to be in the right place
at the right time,

00:03:07.053 --> 00:03:10.023 line:95%,end
and you have to be prepared for the worst.

00:03:11.824 --> 00:03:15.195 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:03:15.261 --> 00:03:16.396 line:95%,end
ABBY: Okay!

00:03:16.462 --> 00:03:17.430 line:95%,end
Come on, back it up,

00:03:17.497 --> 00:03:20.300 line:95%,end
I have no idea
how this is going to go down tomorrow.

00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:21.768 line:95%,end
It could be a hip hop combination

00:03:21.834 --> 00:03:23.369 line:95%,end
just to see how quickly you pick up

00:03:23.436 --> 00:03:26.406 line:95%,end
because I would say hip hop
is the most difficult

00:03:26.472 --> 00:03:28.041 line:95%,end
of choreography to get.

00:03:28.107 --> 00:03:29.008 line:95%,end
<i>We tap.</i>

00:03:29.075 --> 00:03:30.910 line:95%,end
We do acrobatics, gymnastics, hip hop,

00:03:30.977 --> 00:03:32.912 line:95%,end
you know, ethnic dance, creative movement.

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:34.147 line:95%,end
Whatever you need, we do it.

00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:37.951 line:95%,end
<i>But I would say</i>
<i>that hip hop was not their forte.</i>

00:03:38.017 --> 00:03:40.453 line:95%,end
And going up against all these kids
here in Hollywood

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.989 line:95%,end
to do hip hop five days a week--

00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:44.557 line:95%,end
we have our work cut out for us.

00:03:45.258 --> 00:03:46.826 line:95%,end
WOMAN: Aw, you're too funny.

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:48.995 line:95%,end
-Only in a dream.
-Only in a dream.

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:52.398 line:95%,end
Well-deserved, well-deserved.

00:03:52.465 --> 00:03:54.400 line:5%,start
Having the opportunity for my daughters

00:03:54.467 --> 00:03:56.903 line:5%,start
to try out for a music video is amazing.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.839 line:95%,end
I'm going to kind of take it
with what it is.

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:01.975 line:95%,end
We'll go full-out. We'll do it.
We'll see what happens.

00:04:02.041 --> 00:04:03.710 line:95%,end
This is all very foreign to me.

00:04:03.776 --> 00:04:05.078 line:95%,end
I would imagine it's a time commitment,

00:04:05.144 --> 00:04:08.214 line:95%,end
whether you get the gig,
initially--all the running around.

00:04:08.281 --> 00:04:10.416 line:95%,end
-Right. I think that's the thing, is--
-With the auditioning,

00:04:10.483 --> 00:04:11.751 line:95%,end
because you don't just get it off the bat.

00:04:11.818 --> 00:04:14.120 line:95%,end
There's a lot of back work,
and that takes a lot of time.

00:04:14.187 --> 00:04:16.889 line:95%,end
And I worry about that for myself,
because I don't have that amount of time

00:04:16.956 --> 00:04:18.157 line:95%,end
because I have a school.

00:04:18.224 --> 00:04:20.627 line:95%,end
I have two boys.
I have a household to run.

00:04:20.693 --> 00:04:23.896 line:95%,end
I mean, I'm a housewife,
and that's good that I could just leave.

00:04:23.963 --> 00:04:26.332 line:95%,end
I mean, Maddie went to New York
seven times,

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:27.900 line:95%,end
and they would call on a Tuesday.

00:04:27.967 --> 00:04:30.370 line:95%,end
Oh, we have somebody that
wants to see Maddie tomorrow.

00:04:30.436 --> 00:04:31.871 line:95%,end
And I'm like, oh, my gosh. You know?

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:33.239 line:95%,end
Tomorrow, to go to New York.

00:04:33.306 --> 00:04:34.641 line:95%,end
Yeah. We thought we can't.

00:04:34.707 --> 00:04:36.809 line:95%,end
I can't sit here and say that
if an opportunity came along

00:04:36.876 --> 00:04:38.444 line:95%,end
for Nia that I would say...

00:04:38.511 --> 00:04:40.146 line:95%,end
-Oh, can't do that.
-...I can't do it,

00:04:40.213 --> 00:04:41.447 line:95%,end
because Nia wants this.

00:04:41.514 --> 00:04:42.949 line:95%,end
I think we've proved our mettle,

00:04:43.016 --> 00:04:44.617 line:95%,end
that we're willing
to put ourselves out there

00:04:44.684 --> 00:04:45.985 line:95%,end
and do what our kids need.

00:04:46.052 --> 00:04:46.886 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Whatever they need.

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:49.489 line:95%,end
So if things come about, I'm sure that

00:04:49.555 --> 00:04:51.958 line:95%,end
if there's any group of women
that would make it happen,

00:04:52.025 --> 00:04:53.326 line:95%,end
-I think it's us.
-Oh, yeah.

00:04:53.393 --> 00:04:54.594 line:95%,end
And we would help each other, too--

00:04:54.661 --> 00:04:55.928 line:95%,end
-I mean, in a minute.
-WOMAN: Absolutely.

00:04:55.995 --> 00:04:58.931 line:95%,end
If we were going to an audition,
we would take your girls.

<i>Melissa is the master manipulator.</i>

00:05:01.334 --> 00:05:03.036 line:95%,end
I always say that she's calculated.

00:05:03.102 --> 00:05:06.472 line:95%,end
But she's always saying,
oh, I would do anything for the children.

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:07.940 line:95%,end
You know what?

00:05:08.007 --> 00:05:09.942 line:95%,end
She would do anything for your children.

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:11.644 line:95%,end
WOMAN: <i>Melissa knows how to play the game,</i>

00:05:11.711 --> 00:05:12.945 line:95%,end

00:05:13.012 --> 00:05:15.014 line:95%,end
MELISSA: We all think

00:05:15.081 --> 00:05:16.149 line:95%,end
-Of course we do.
-MELISSA: ...but LA?

00:05:16.215 --> 00:05:19.986 line:95%,end
-Everybody thinks their kids are special.
-MELISSA: LA? These kids are a lot.

00:05:20.053 --> 00:05:21.421 line:95%,end
There are amazing kids here.

00:05:21.487 --> 00:05:23.156 line:95%,end
I'm not worried about Maddie

00:05:23.222 --> 00:05:25.425 line:95%,end
<i>because she is the best all-round</i>
<i>dancer in the studio,</i>

00:05:25.491 --> 00:05:27.427 line:95%,end

Strut, two, three, four, draw plie.

Wow.

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:39.205 line:95%,end
Got it?

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:42.075 line:5%,start
Abby is funny-looking when
she tries to do hip hop.

00:05:42.675 --> 00:05:46.379 line:95%,end
Cross, chainee turn, bevel, kiss.

00:05:46.446 --> 00:05:48.381 line:95%,end
Girls, you need to be stronger.

00:05:48.448 --> 00:05:49.716 line:95%,end
Emphasize each movement.

00:05:49.782 --> 00:05:51.017 line:95%,end
It needs to be bigger.

00:05:51.084 --> 00:05:53.286 line:95%,end
That girl standing
next to you at that audition

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:54.954 line:95%,end
could have already done 20 videos.

00:05:55.822 --> 00:05:56.956 line:95%,end

<i>for that music video audition,</i>

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:01.527 line:95%,end
<i>but I'm also kind of excited.</i>

00:06:01.594 --> 00:06:05.898 line:5%,start
The bad part is, Abby told us
that it's going to be a hip hop audition.

00:06:15.074 --> 00:06:16.309 line:95%,end
You either get it, or you don't.

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:18.211 line:95%,end
You have to be able to pull it off.

00:06:18.277 --> 00:06:20.179 line:95%,end
There's really no way to prepare for this

00:06:20.246 --> 00:06:23.649 line:95%,end
except by being an amazing dancer
in all genres of dance.

00:06:25.251 --> 00:06:26.552 line:95%,end
All right, next two.

Come on. Hustle up.

MSA is casting this video,

00:06:42.468 --> 00:06:44.404 line:95%,end
a major dance agency

As you all know, MSA represents

00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:08.594 line:5%,start
the top dancers and choreographers
in the business.

00:07:08.661 --> 00:07:09.996 line:95%,end
What we're doing here today is,

00:07:10.062 --> 00:07:12.298 line:95%,end
we're looking for our next
generation of stars.

00:07:12.365 --> 00:07:13.633 line:95%,end
So with that, please have fun,

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:15.234 line:95%,end

BEN: All right. So in an audition setting,

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.308 line:95%,end
paying attention is key. All right?

00:07:22.375 --> 00:07:25.144 line:95%,end
We want to take our time
so you guys can get the combo well.

00:07:25.211 --> 00:07:28.214 line:5%,start
So your timing is one,
two, three, and four.

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:30.516 line:5%,start
Five, six, seven, and eight.

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:34.754 line:95%,end

00:07:34.821 --> 00:07:38.224 line:95%,end
CHLOE: <i>We're having to learn</i>
<i>the combination really fast,</i>

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:40.226 line:95%,end
and it's actually pretty long.

00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:43.663 line:95%,end
And then we have to go
and audition for the agents.

00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:45.531 line:95%,end
So that's a little nerve-wracking.

00:07:45.598 --> 00:07:46.532 line:95%,end
From the top--

00:07:46.599 --> 00:07:48.901 line:95%,end
five, six, seven, and eight.

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:51.571 line:95%,end
Go switch, drop, pull, switch, switch.

00:07:53.806 --> 00:07:55.575 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>Usually, the way an audition works</i>

00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:57.243 line:95%,end
is, the girls learn the choreography

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:58.377 line:95%,end
in big, huge groups.

00:07:58.444 --> 00:08:00.313 line:95%,end
You could take 100 kids in at a time.

00:08:00.379 --> 00:08:02.081 line:95%,end
Then they start to cut,

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:05.418 line:95%,end
and they break it down into smaller groups
to actually go in and audition.

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:08.554 line:95%,end

00:08:15.228 --> 00:08:16.929 line:95%,end
Do as much as you can. Okay?

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:18.364 line:95%,end
I want you try for as much as you can.

00:08:18.431 --> 00:08:19.298 line:95%,end
Don't worry about it.

00:08:23.703 --> 00:08:25.538 line:95%,end
they're going to look you up

Yes. No. Thank you.

00:08:27.273 --> 00:08:29.842 line:95%,end
You can leave. Yes, yes, maybe.

00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:31.577 line:95%,end
And whisper about you
right in front of you.

00:08:31.644 --> 00:08:33.379 line:95%,end
Girls, this is a chance of a lifetime.

00:08:33.446 --> 00:08:36.749 line:95%,end
Yes. There aren't any second chances.

00:08:36.816 --> 00:08:39.318 line:95%,end
The very first impression
is the most important.

00:08:39.385 --> 00:08:40.686 line:95%,end
Do you understand me? Yes?

00:08:40.753 --> 00:08:41.988 line:95%,end
All right, let's give it to them.

00:08:42.054 --> 00:08:43.556 line:95%,end
Have fun, and keep dancing.

16 counts to improv,

00:09:32.204 --> 00:09:34.407 line:95%,end

One thing that you're learning about

00:09:50.089 --> 00:09:52.625 line:95%,end
is that rejection
is a huge part of the business.

they have ever had in their career.

There's a number of things
that we look for

when we have an audition.

00:10:14.947 --> 00:10:17.617 line:95%,end
It's not always about dance technique

and all of those sorts of things.

00:10:19.185 --> 00:10:21.220 line:95%,end
There's a commercial aspect
that we look for--

00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:24.590 line:95%,end
dance-ability and your presence
and how you adapt.

00:10:24.657 --> 00:10:27.793 line:95%,end
As we always say, as you walk in
from the very first moment

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.696 line:95%,end
into the audition, we do take notice.

00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:34.900 line:95%,end
But we do have amazing news
for all of you ladies,

00:10:34.967 --> 00:10:37.603 line:95%,end

for a girl dance group,

would be perfect for that.

BROOKE: I normally don't get
very excited about things,

Okay, cool.

00:12:39.125 --> 00:12:40.893 line:95%,end
So I'm on both of those shows.

And you guys are going to have long days,

00:12:42.161 --> 00:12:44.563 line:95%,end

like you've never done before.

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:46.198 line:95%,end

an on-screen test

00:12:50.202 --> 00:12:53.606 line:95%,end
I'm going to get to select just one of you

00:12:53.672 --> 00:12:55.074 line:95%,end
who's going to get to be the star
of this video.

00:12:55.141 --> 00:12:56.242 line:95%,end
So...

00:12:57.476 --> 00:12:58.544 line:95%,end
you girls up for it?

00:12:58.611 --> 00:12:59.745 line:95%,end
-GIRLS: Yes.
-RAY: Awesome.

00:12:59.812 --> 00:13:00.646 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>The bar is set.</i>

00:13:00.713 --> 00:13:03.382 line:95%,end
<i>The stakes are raised</i>
<i>because one child gets to be the lead.</i>

00:13:03.449 --> 00:13:06.252 line:95%,end
<i>So of course there is that</i>
<i>internal competition between us</i>

00:13:06.318 --> 00:13:08.387 line:95%,end
because who doesn't want
their kid to be the star?

00:13:08.454 --> 00:13:10.289 line:95%,end
Ray, whip them into shape.

00:13:10.356 --> 00:13:11.657 line:95%,end
-All righty.
-We'll see you in a little bit.

00:13:11.724 --> 00:13:13.859 line:95%,end
-Good luck. Will do.
-GIRLS: Thank you.

00:13:13.926 --> 00:13:17.062 line:95%,end
CHLOE: <i>I want to be the lead</i>
<i>in this video so bad.</i>

00:13:17.129 --> 00:13:19.532 line:5%,start
I would like to make it big in Hollywood

00:13:19.598 --> 00:13:22.535 line:5%,start
and be the featured one in a music video--

00:13:22.601 --> 00:13:24.036 line:95%,end
my first music video.

00:13:24.103 --> 00:13:26.205 line:95%,end
MADDIE: <i>I hope I get chosen</i>

00:13:26.272 --> 00:13:29.708 line:5%,start
because I just like
being the lead of stuff.

00:13:29.775 --> 00:13:31.443 line:95%,end
Five, six, seven, eight.

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:36.048 line:95%,end
We have one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.

00:13:36.115 --> 00:13:37.449 line:95%,end
Roll.

00:13:37.516 --> 00:13:39.251 line:95%,end
-And up. Perfect.
-Good.

00:13:39.318 --> 00:13:41.020 line:95%,end
You have to look at the boy on four

00:13:41.086 --> 00:13:42.488 line:95%,end
and make eye contact with him.

00:13:42.555 --> 00:13:43.489 line:95%,end
Chloe has it.

00:13:43.556 --> 00:13:44.456 line:95%,end
All right, Mackenzie.

00:13:44.523 --> 00:13:45.658 line:95%,end
Ready to try this?

00:13:45.724 --> 00:13:47.793 line:95%,end
Five, six, seven, eight.

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:49.762 line:95%,end
One, two, three, four,

00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:51.764 line:95%,end
go five, six, seven, knees.

00:13:51.831 --> 00:13:55.000 line:95%,end
One, two, three, four, bend, five, six.


00:13:57.069 --> 00:13:58.838 line:95%,end
Oh, it's okay. No tears.

00:13:58.904 --> 00:14:00.039 line:95%,end
You okay, Mackenzie?

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.374 line:95%,end
You're good. You want to get a drink?

00:14:02.942 --> 00:14:03.776 line:95%,end
Quick drink? All right.

00:14:03.843 --> 00:14:05.044 line:95%,end
Let's get a quick drink real quick.

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:06.612 line:95%,end
Go take a two-minute water break, yeah?

00:14:09.949 --> 00:14:10.816 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Honey, I promise you.

00:14:11.684 --> 00:14:12.818 line:95%,end
You did so good.

00:14:12.885 --> 00:14:14.220 line:95%,end
Please don't make me go.

00:14:14.286 --> 00:14:16.722 line:95%,end
MELISSA: <i>She doesn't want to do it.</i>
<i>She doesn't want to dance.</i>

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:19.592 line:5%,start
She had a little meltdown.

00:14:19.658 --> 00:14:20.659 line:95%,end
Is she okay?

00:14:21.227 --> 00:14:22.361 line:95%,end
MELISSA: She can't keep up with them.

00:14:22.428 --> 00:14:23.562 line:95%,end
You know, she's trying.

00:14:23.629 --> 00:14:25.264 line:95%,end
The moves were too fast for me.

00:14:25.331 --> 00:14:26.899 line:95%,end
I was just confused.

00:14:26.966 --> 00:14:28.901 line:95%,end
Okay, let's just go sit in there
and watch.

00:14:28.968 --> 00:14:30.069 line:95%,end
Don't. You can't hold me.

00:14:30.135 --> 00:14:31.737 line:95%,end
You're not a baby
and I'm not dealing with it.

00:14:31.804 --> 00:14:32.905 line:5%,start
-You okay?
-MELISSA: She's fine.

00:14:32.972 --> 00:14:35.207 line:95%,end
All righty. Let's just listen
to these words. Okay, ladies?

00:14:36.308 --> 00:14:37.576 line:95%,end
Here we are in Hollywood,

00:14:37.643 --> 00:14:39.979 line:95%,end
and there's all these
wonderful opportunities

00:14:40.045 --> 00:14:41.614 line:95%,end
that we don't get
in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.883 line:95%,end
<i>Right now, we're in</i>
<i>a professional atmosphere,</i>

00:14:43.949 --> 00:14:45.751 line:95%,end
<i>and they need to pull it together.</i>

00:14:46.418 --> 00:14:49.188 line:95%,end
On the day of the video shoot,
we have the boys coming in.

00:14:49.255 --> 00:14:51.156 line:95%,end
We still have to see the set.

00:14:51.223 --> 00:14:52.191 line:95%,end
The director's going to be there.

00:14:52.258 --> 00:14:54.026 line:95%,end
He's going to be giving us new direction.

00:14:54.093 --> 00:14:56.195 line:95%,end
So I really need you to
know these lyrics and these dance moves

00:14:56.262 --> 00:14:58.931 line:95%,end
right in the first thing in the morning
of the video shoot, okay?

00:14:58.998 --> 00:15:00.733 line:95%,end
-GIRLS: Thank you.
-Perfect. Thank you so much.

00:15:00.799 --> 00:15:01.734 line:95%,end
I'll see you guys later.

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.903 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:15:03.969 --> 00:15:05.638 line:95%,end
-GIRL: I'm so excited.
-Here we are!

00:15:06.972 --> 00:15:07.806 line:95%,end
WOMAN: <i>Hi, ladies.</i>

00:15:07.873 --> 00:15:10.075 line:95%,end
CHLOE: We had to do a screen test
for the music video,

00:15:10.142 --> 00:15:12.678 line:95%,end
so we went to the salon and got our nails

00:15:12.745 --> 00:15:15.147 line:95%,end
<i>and tested out our hair</i>
<i>and tested out our makeup.</i>

00:15:15.214 --> 00:15:17.383 line:95%,end
It was totally awesome.

00:15:17.449 --> 00:15:18.918 line:95%,end
I think big.

00:15:18.984 --> 00:15:21.253 line:95%,end
Either have a high ponytail

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.322 line:95%,end
with a lot of volume.

00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:25.391 line:95%,end
I hope I get chosen as the lead

00:15:25.457 --> 00:15:28.327 line:95%,end
<i>because I'm more of an actress.</i>

00:15:28.394 --> 00:15:30.162 line:95%,end
How are the nails doing?

00:15:30.229 --> 00:15:32.164 line:95%,end
-Great.
-That looks amazing.

00:15:32.231 --> 00:15:33.799 line:95%,end
That choreographer was awesome.

00:15:33.866 --> 00:15:34.700 line:95%,end
I mean, Mackenzie...

00:15:34.767 --> 00:15:36.235 line:95%,end
Yeah, they're going to need
to work on that all week.

00:15:36.302 --> 00:15:37.236 line:95%,end
(groans)

00:15:37.836 --> 00:15:39.605 line:95%,end
MELISSA: <i>I'm not worried about Maddie</i>

00:15:39.672 --> 00:15:42.574 line:95%,end
<i>because she can handle all</i>
<i>the rehearsal time and all the practice.</i>

00:15:42.641 --> 00:15:44.276 line:95%,end
<i>Mackenzie, on the other hand--</i>

00:15:44.343 --> 00:15:46.078 line:95%,end
<i>she can't handle all the long hours.</i>

00:15:46.145 --> 00:15:48.647 line:95%,end
So I definitely am
a little concerned about her.

00:15:48.714 --> 00:15:49.949 line:95%,end
And they're going to dance with boys.

00:15:50.015 --> 00:15:51.850 line:95%,end
I think that's cute
that they're going to partner.

00:15:51.917 --> 00:15:53.986 line:95%,end
But I'm confused because
the artist is, like, in her 20s.

00:15:54.053 --> 00:15:55.654 line:95%,end
Why does she want little kids
in her videos?

00:15:55.721 --> 00:15:56.922 line:95%,end
I don't know.

00:15:58.457 --> 00:16:00.292 line:95%,end
Chloe, you look so pretty.

00:16:01.393 --> 00:16:02.761 line:95%,end
BROOKE: <i>I think it's super cool</i>

00:16:02.828 --> 00:16:06.532 line:95%,end
that somebody gets to be
the lead in the music video,

00:16:06.598 --> 00:16:09.401 line:95%,end
and I think it would be really cool
to be the lead.

00:16:09.468 --> 00:16:11.403 line:95%,end
All the crazy talk from Abby

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:14.073 line:95%,end
about learning a new routine in a week.

00:16:14.139 --> 00:16:16.608 line:95%,end
-And I thought that was crazy.
-Oh my god. It paid off.

00:16:16.675 --> 00:16:18.477 line:95%,end
-It paid off.
-Here's my crow.

00:16:18.544 --> 00:16:21.347 line:95%,end
Here's your helping.
Here's your helping. Here's my helping.

00:16:21.413 --> 00:16:22.681 line:95%,end
It's a little bitter.

00:16:23.582 --> 00:16:27.186 line:95%,end
CHLOE: I think we all had big hair
and big makeup,

00:16:27.252 --> 00:16:30.289 line:95%,end
and it was kind of funny to see us all...

00:16:32.091 --> 00:16:32.992 line:95%,end
big everything.

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:36.328 line:95%,end
Oh, my gosh!

00:16:36.395 --> 00:16:38.130 line:95%,end
(laughing)

00:16:38.197 --> 00:16:39.865 line:95%,end
Can you dance in that hairdo?

00:16:41.367 --> 00:16:42.835 line:95%,end
You look amazing, Chloe.

00:16:42.901 --> 00:16:44.470 line:95%,end
You look like Barbie.

00:16:45.504 --> 00:16:47.406 line:95%,end
Oh, my gosh. You look so pretty.

00:16:48.607 --> 00:16:50.476 line:95%,end
Oh, I love it.

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:52.878 line:95%,end
Ahh!

00:16:52.945 --> 00:16:54.313 line:95%,end
Look, how cute!

00:16:56.315 --> 00:16:58.517 line:95%,end
Ooh, it grew!

00:16:58.584 --> 00:16:59.952 line:95%,end
We're going to send this off to Seven

00:17:00.019 --> 00:17:01.687 line:95%,end
and see if he approves
the look and everything.

00:17:01.754 --> 00:17:04.156 line:95%,end
Ready? One, two, three.

00:17:05.057 --> 00:17:06.425 line:95%,end
Amazing.

00:17:06.492 --> 00:17:07.960 line:95%,end
See you ladies on set.

00:17:08.027 --> 00:17:11.263 line:95%,end
-Thank you!
-Okay, goodbye.

00:17:13.832 --> 00:17:16.702 line:95%,end
MELISSA: <i>There's going to be a video</i>
<i>competition for the lead.</i>

00:17:16.769 --> 00:17:20.105 line:95%,end
And if it's for dance, of course--
just based on dance,

00:17:20.172 --> 00:17:22.307 line:95%,end
we all pretty much know
that Maddie will get it.

00:17:22.374 --> 00:17:23.642 line:95%,end
But we're in Hollywood,

00:17:23.709 --> 00:17:25.878 line:95%,end
<i>so I think it's going to be</i>
<i>a tough competition.</i>

00:17:25.944 --> 00:17:28.614 line:95%,end
<i>I will do anything to help</i>
<i>Maddie become the star.</i>

00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:30.883 line:95%,end
-Hi.
-Hey.

00:17:30.949 --> 00:17:32.317 line:95%,end
-How are you, Melissa?
-Good.

00:17:32.384 --> 00:17:34.086 line:95%,end
-Good to see you.
-Nice to see you, too.

00:17:34.153 --> 00:17:36.388 line:95%,end
-Thanks so much for meeting me.
-Of course.

00:17:36.455 --> 00:17:38.524 line:95%,end
MELISSA: It's so awesome.
I really appreciate it.

00:17:39.925 --> 00:17:41.460 line:95%,end
What can I help you with?

00:17:41.527 --> 00:17:43.162 line:95%,end
You know, in wanting
to meet with me, today--

00:17:43.228 --> 00:17:45.364 line:95%,end
what can I really help you to achieve?

00:17:45.431 --> 00:17:46.832 line:95%,end
Um...


00:17:48.801 --> 00:17:51.537 line:95%,end
(suspenseful music playing)

00:17:52.438 --> 00:17:55.140 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I decided to call Seven,
the producer,

00:17:55.207 --> 00:17:58.010 line:5%,start
to see what he's looking for in the girls.

00:17:58.077 --> 00:17:59.378 line:5%,start
SEVEN: So I love Maddie.

00:17:59.445 --> 00:18:00.979 line:5%,start
She's a great kid.

00:18:01.046 --> 00:18:02.681 line:95%,end
She wants to get into show biz.

00:18:02.748 --> 00:18:03.849 line:95%,end
You know, it's her dream.

00:18:03.916 --> 00:18:07.486 line:95%,end
SEVEN: This career--it's really
about having that "it factor."

00:18:07.553 --> 00:18:10.889 line:95%,end
You think that she has
the "it factor" that you're saying?

00:18:12.691 --> 00:18:14.393 line:95%,end
She definitely has talent.

00:18:15.227 --> 00:18:16.795 line:95%,end
As far as this video is concerned,

00:18:16.862 --> 00:18:18.997 line:95%,end
it all comes down to all the things

00:18:19.064 --> 00:18:21.667 line:95%,end
that need to be there--
the dancing, the acting.

00:18:21.733 --> 00:18:24.570 line:95%,end
MELISSA: We're in LA, and I want Maddie
to have the best chance she can

00:18:24.636 --> 00:18:25.938 line:95%,end
to make it in this business.

00:18:26.004 --> 00:18:29.074 line:95%,end
So as her mom, I'm going to do
whatever I can do to help her.

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:34.113 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:18:34.179 --> 00:18:36.782 line:5%,start
WOMAN: Four, five, six, seven, eight.

00:18:37.216 --> 00:18:38.183 line:5%,start
Slide, two...

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:39.351 line:5%,start
MADDIE: <i>I think I have a good chance</i>

00:18:39.418 --> 00:18:41.553 line:5%,start
<i>of being the lead in the music video</i>

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:43.655 line:5%,start
because I'm the one
that always really practices

00:18:43.722 --> 00:18:44.756 line:5%,start
at the dance studio.

00:18:44.823 --> 00:18:46.658 line:95%,end
<i>And I think it's really important for me</i>

00:18:46.725 --> 00:18:49.161 line:95%,end
<i>just to practice this music video</i>
<i>by myself</i>

00:18:49.228 --> 00:18:50.429 line:95%,end
because it's a big deal.

00:18:50.496 --> 00:18:53.532 line:95%,end
Three, four, sass, sway, seven, eight.

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:56.835 line:95%,end
Two, Three, four, and walk.

00:18:56.902 --> 00:18:58.904 line:95%,end
MADDIE: We don't really do hip hop
in our dance studio,

00:18:58.971 --> 00:19:01.073 line:95%,end
but I think I'm just going to keep trying,

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:04.309 line:95%,end
so that might help me get the main part.

00:19:04.376 --> 00:19:05.344 line:95%,end
WOMAN: Up and in.

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:08.247 line:95%,end
Walk, walk, three-step turn, blow.

00:19:08.847 --> 00:19:09.681 line:95%,end
Good.

00:19:14.419 --> 00:19:16.221 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: <i>For the music video,</i>
<i>they're looking for someone</i>

00:19:16.288 --> 00:19:19.691 line:5%,start
<i>who can really act, somebody</i>
<i>who's really going to be, you know,</i>

00:19:19.758 --> 00:19:22.427 line:5%,start
<i>animated and believable on camera.</i>

00:19:22.494 --> 00:19:24.196 line:5%,start
<i>So I set up a meeting for Chloe</i>

00:19:24.263 --> 00:19:27.166 line:5%,start
<i>with one of the best acting coaches</i>
<i>in LA, Howard Fine.</i>

00:19:27.232 --> 00:19:29.801 line:95%,end
HOWARD: If your goal
is really to be an actress,

00:19:29.868 --> 00:19:31.470 line:95%,end
you have to have this open heart.

00:19:31.537 --> 00:19:34.339 line:95%,end
So we're going to explore
a little bit emotional recall.

00:19:34.406 --> 00:19:37.009 line:95%,end
Can you remember
the saddest day of your life,

00:19:37.075 --> 00:19:38.443 line:95%,end
what that would be?

00:19:39.511 --> 00:19:42.848 line:95%,end
I think when my great-grandfather died

00:19:42.915 --> 00:19:45.150 line:95%,end
because I had a very good
relationship with him.

00:19:45.217 --> 00:19:47.419 line:95%,end
-HOWARD: Do you remember that day?
-CHLOE: Mm-hmm.

00:19:47.486 --> 00:19:48.520 line:95%,end
HOWARD: Tell me about it.

00:19:50.956 --> 00:19:53.825 line:95%,end
I know my mind
was kind of just blank there.

00:19:55.727 --> 00:19:57.796 line:5%,start
I'm having a hard time getting emotional,

00:19:57.863 --> 00:20:00.966 line:5%,start
and I'm having a hard time
expressing myself to him.

00:20:01.033 --> 00:20:03.602 line:95%,end
So as an actress,
this is what it's all about--

00:20:03.669 --> 00:20:05.904 line:95%,end
contacting real sources.

00:20:06.672 --> 00:20:08.774 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>He really made her</i>
<i>look inside herself,</i>

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:10.642 line:95%,end
<i>and it became very introspective.</i>

00:20:10.709 --> 00:20:13.412 line:95%,end
And I don't think
that's what Chloe envisioned

00:20:13.478 --> 00:20:15.113 line:95%,end
an acting class to be like.

00:20:16.114 --> 00:20:18.650 line:95%,end
HOWARD: Do you consider yourself
the number one dancer in the company?

00:20:19.718 --> 00:20:22.654 line:95%,end
There's another girl that's pretty good.

00:20:22.721 --> 00:20:23.655 line:95%,end
Her name is Maddie.

00:20:23.722 --> 00:20:28.227 line:95%,end
I think we're maybe
the better ones in the group.

00:20:28.293 --> 00:20:32.064 line:95%,end
Good. What stops you
from going for number one?


00:20:33.098 --> 00:20:34.733 line:95%,end
Nothing, I guess.

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.101 line:95%,end
-What's that?
-Nothing.

00:20:36.168 --> 00:20:38.737 line:95%,end
HOWARD: Nothing stops you
from going for number one.

00:20:38.804 --> 00:20:40.706 line:95%,end
I have a feeling you stop yourself.

00:20:42.474 --> 00:20:44.710 line:95%,end
And it could be because
you're such a sensitive little girl

00:20:44.776 --> 00:20:46.979 line:95%,end
that you think about how
the others might be hurt.

00:20:47.613 --> 00:20:49.047 line:95%,end
-Does that make sense?
-Yes.

00:20:49.114 --> 00:20:52.517 line:95%,end
HOWARD: Okay, you have to understand that
your success doesn't hurt anybody else.

00:20:52.584 --> 00:20:54.553 line:95%,end
CHLOE: Mr. Fine said,
when I walk in there,

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:57.256 line:95%,end
pretend like I already have
the lead character

00:20:57.322 --> 00:20:58.590 line:95%,end
and be really confident.

00:20:58.657 --> 00:21:01.660 line:95%,end
HOWARD: So, Chloe, I want you
not to be afraid,

00:21:01.727 --> 00:21:04.463 line:95%,end
to be strong.

00:21:04.529 --> 00:21:08.834 line:95%,end
You have to stop beating yourself up
and doubting yourself.

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:11.069 line:95%,end
Chloe has really been struggling
with her confidence lately,

00:21:11.136 --> 00:21:13.639 line:95%,end
and personally, I think it has a lot to do
with Abby constantly

00:21:13.705 --> 00:21:15.474 line:95%,end
yelling at her and berating her.

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:17.876 line:95%,end
I think if she could get comfortable
in her own skin,

00:21:17.943 --> 00:21:19.411 line:95%,end
she could totally pull this off.

00:21:19.478 --> 00:21:20.345 line:95%,end
Absolutely.

00:21:20.412 --> 00:21:21.346 line:95%,end
-All right
-Thank you.

00:21:21.413 --> 00:21:23.548 line:95%,end
-Bye-bye, thank you so much.
-Thank you.

00:21:23.615 --> 00:21:26.618 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:21:27.286 --> 00:21:29.087 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>When the girls are busy rehearsing,</i>

00:21:29.154 --> 00:21:32.257 line:95%,end
<i>it's an opportunity for us moms</i>
<i>to get out and see the town.</i>

00:21:32.324 --> 00:21:34.860 line:5%,start
I feel bad for the girls
because us moms are always out

00:21:34.926 --> 00:21:36.428 line:5%,start
having fun while they're busy rehearsing.

00:21:36.495 --> 00:21:38.964 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I'm just excited that our girls
are finally getting to do something

00:21:39.031 --> 00:21:41.633 line:95%,end
that Abby doesn't determine
who the star is.

00:21:42.434 --> 00:21:45.704 line:95%,end
I am, and I mean,
I'm not going to beat around the bush.

00:21:45.771 --> 00:21:47.773 line:95%,end
I think all of us are sitting here
hoping it's our kids

00:21:47.839 --> 00:21:50.242 line:95%,end
because they're so used to Abby
being the way she is.

00:21:50.309 --> 00:21:51.843 line:95%,end
WOMAN: I guarantee you, it'll be mine.

00:21:52.911 --> 00:21:56.448 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I actually went out to coffee
with Seven the other day.

00:21:59.951 --> 00:22:01.486 line:95%,end
-Oh, did you?
-MELISSA: Mm-hmm.

00:22:01.553 --> 00:22:02.387 line:95%,end
Oh!

00:22:02.454 --> 00:22:05.557 line:95%,end
KELLY: So I'm assuming
since you met with him for lunch--

00:22:05.624 --> 00:22:07.292 line:95%,end
-is Maddie the star?
-No.

00:22:07.359 --> 00:22:08.694 line:95%,end
No, no, no. Not at all.

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.162 line:95%,end
That's not playing by the rules.

00:22:10.228 --> 00:22:11.763 line:95%,end
I would never think
to go with the producer

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:13.699 line:95%,end
because I think of playing by the rules.

00:22:13.765 --> 00:22:15.734 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Playing by the rules?
Why is that not playing by the rules?

00:22:15.801 --> 00:22:18.737 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Because it's going above
and beyond what the rest of us do.

00:22:20.272 --> 00:22:21.106 line:95%,end
I don't think that at all.

00:22:21.173 --> 00:22:23.208 line:95%,end
<i>Of course Melissa met</i>
<i>with the producer Seven.</i>

00:22:23.275 --> 00:22:24.710 line:5%,start
It's Maddie we're talking about.

00:22:24.776 --> 00:22:27.145 line:5%,start
She would do anything
to make sure Maddie got the starring role.

00:22:27.212 --> 00:22:28.947 line:95%,end
You have an advantage over us.

00:22:29.815 --> 00:22:31.650 line:5%,start
MELISSA: Christi says
I don't play by the rules.

00:22:31.717 --> 00:22:33.085 line:5%,start
What rules? This is Hollywood.

00:22:33.151 --> 00:22:34.586 line:5%,start
This isn't Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:22:34.653 --> 00:22:35.687 line:95%,end
<i>I'll do whatever I want.</i>

00:22:35.754 --> 00:22:36.621 line:95%,end
<i>I don't answer to her.</i>

00:22:36.688 --> 00:22:39.124 line:95%,end
KELLY: I don't know.
That's why Maddie gets ahead.

00:22:40.258 --> 00:22:42.394 line:95%,end
And I'm really naive, because I think
if you just go to an audition,

00:22:42.461 --> 00:22:44.129 line:95%,end
you get (indistinct)
based on your audition.

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:47.065 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>Once again,</i>
<i>it's not an even playing field.</i>

00:22:47.132 --> 00:22:49.101 line:95%,end
This is what we've been dealing
with all season.

00:22:49.167 --> 00:22:51.737 line:95%,end
And frankly, this is what
we've been dealing with for years.

00:22:51.803 --> 00:22:54.106 line:95%,end
So, you know, I went into this thinking

00:22:54.172 --> 00:22:56.375 line:95%,end
that my daughter had at least a chance.

00:22:56.441 --> 00:22:58.910 line:95%,end
And at this point,
of course she doesn't have a chance.

00:22:58.977 --> 00:23:02.381 line:95%,end
I didn't take the director out
for, you know, cocktails, so.

00:23:02.447 --> 00:23:03.882 line:95%,end
HOLLY: And those connections
involving relationships.

00:23:03.949 --> 00:23:05.317 line:95%,end
-I'm sorry.
-Melissa--

00:23:05.384 --> 00:23:06.551 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I'm done. I'm done.

00:23:06.618 --> 00:23:07.886 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Excuse me.
Don't talk to me that way.

00:23:07.953 --> 00:23:09.588 line:95%,end
-That's the first thing.
-MELISSA: I'm just saying, I'm done.

00:23:09.654 --> 00:23:11.656 line:95%,end
You don't understand. I'm done.


00:23:14.393 --> 00:23:17.162 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:23:20.799 --> 00:23:23.402 line:95%,end
(indistinct chatter)

00:23:23.468 --> 00:23:25.036 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I feel like
we're in an AA meeting.

00:23:25.103 --> 00:23:27.973 line:95%,end
Hi, my name is Christi,
and I'm a dance mom.

00:23:28.039 --> 00:23:29.374 line:5%,start
Here we are--the day the music video,

00:23:29.441 --> 00:23:32.411 line:5%,start
and it's so amazing to be in Hollywood.

00:23:32.477 --> 00:23:35.013 line:95%,end
<i>All I can think is, how did we get here?</i>

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:38.016 line:95%,end
We are a bunch of moms
with kids from Pittsburgh.

00:23:38.083 --> 00:23:40.585 line:95%,end
Like, how did we end up here?

00:23:43.221 --> 00:23:44.156 line:95%,end
ABBY: Now, listen.

00:23:44.222 --> 00:23:45.791 line:95%,end
This is a professional job.

00:23:45.857 --> 00:23:47.859 line:95%,end
You're in LA. You're in Hollywood.

00:23:47.926 --> 00:23:49.761 line:95%,end
You're at a soundstage.

00:23:49.828 --> 00:23:52.197 line:95%,end
You are doing a real video shoot.

00:23:52.264 --> 00:23:54.299 line:5%,start
Today, the girls are going to get
their first taste

00:23:54.366 --> 00:23:55.934 line:5%,start
of being a professional dancer.

00:23:56.001 --> 00:23:58.103 line:5%,start
This is everything
that they have worked for.

00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:00.572 line:95%,end
<i>They just need to apply</i>
<i>everything I've taught them,</i>

00:24:00.639 --> 00:24:02.307 line:95%,end
<i>remember everything they've learned,</i>

00:24:02.374 --> 00:24:03.375 line:95%,end
<i>and they'll do fine.</i>

00:24:03.442 --> 00:24:05.811 line:95%,end
I think all of these boys
have worked before.

00:24:06.378 --> 00:24:07.546 line:95%,end
<i>They've all done videos.</i>

00:24:07.612 --> 00:24:08.880 line:95%,end
<i>They're used to doing this.</i>

00:24:08.947 --> 00:24:11.583 line:95%,end
<i>I want you to be</i>
<i>just as professional as they are.</i>

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:12.617 line:95%,end
Okay?

00:24:12.684 --> 00:24:14.920 line:5%,start
The girls are dancing with boys.

00:24:14.986 --> 00:24:17.122 line:95%,end
<i>And the girls are really excited</i>
<i>about that part.</i>

00:24:17.189 --> 00:24:18.523 line:95%,end
<i>It's really adorable.</i>

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:21.460 line:95%,end
ABBY: Thank you all
for working with my girls today,

00:24:21.526 --> 00:24:23.695 line:95%,end
and have fun, and make them look good.

00:24:23.762 --> 00:24:25.530 line:95%,end
You know, that's the guy's job, right?

00:24:25.597 --> 00:24:27.432 line:95%,end
I'm watching the boys partner my girls,

00:24:27.499 --> 00:24:28.834 line:95%,end
and I'm a little bit concerned.

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:30.469 line:95%,end
<i>First of all, they're not very big.</i>

00:24:30.535 --> 00:24:32.971 line:95%,end
A guy should be about six inches taller
than his partner.

00:24:33.038 --> 00:24:36.041 line:95%,end
RAY: Phillip, we're going to put you
with Mackenzie.

00:24:36.107 --> 00:24:37.509 line:95%,end
Mackenzie is with this little boy.

00:24:37.576 --> 00:24:40.712 line:95%,end
He's darling, and I'm sure
he's very good at what he does.

00:24:40.779 --> 00:24:44.115 line:95%,end
But he has to drop her down
to a split and pick her back up.

00:24:44.182 --> 00:24:46.017 line:95%,end
I don't think he could pick up
his backpack.

00:24:46.084 --> 00:24:48.186 line:95%,end
One, two, three, and four,

00:24:48.253 --> 00:24:50.655 line:95%,end
back, five, six, seven, and eight.

00:24:50.722 --> 00:24:54.226 line:95%,end
MELISSA: We're watching the boys and
the girls starting to rehearse together,

00:24:54.292 --> 00:24:57.062 line:95%,end
and Mackenzie's partner
is the same size as her.

00:24:57.729 --> 00:25:00.832 line:95%,end
<i>And he is a bit clueless.</i>

00:25:00.899 --> 00:25:03.502 line:95%,end
RAY: Five, six, seven, eight.

00:25:03.568 --> 00:25:06.037 line:95%,end
One and two, three and four,

00:25:06.104 --> 00:25:08.206 line:95%,end
five, six, seven, eight.

00:25:08.273 --> 00:25:09.107 line:95%,end
Up one.

00:25:09.174 --> 00:25:10.742 line:95%,end
Let's try it again, okay,

00:25:10.809 --> 00:25:12.444 line:95%,end
just so we can get it all
in our heads and partner together.

00:25:12.511 --> 00:25:14.279 line:95%,end
-What's wrong?
-What's wrong?

00:25:14.813 --> 00:25:16.081 line:95%,end
You knew it perfectly.

00:25:16.147 --> 00:25:17.349 line:95%,end
I can't do it.

00:25:17.415 --> 00:25:18.517 line:95%,end
Why?

00:25:19.451 --> 00:25:22.187 line:95%,end
Okay, what--yes, you can.

00:25:22.787 --> 00:25:25.056 line:95%,end
-Mackenzie, you look good.
-RAY: Mackenzie, you look great, girl.

00:25:25.857 --> 00:25:27.192 line:95%,end
Do you want to try it one more time?

00:25:27.259 --> 00:25:28.660 line:95%,end
You're ready to do it, Mackenzie.

00:25:28.727 --> 00:25:30.095 line:95%,end
-What's wrong, babe?
-MACKENZIE: No, I'm not.

00:25:30.161 --> 00:25:31.162 line:95%,end
I'm not ready.

00:25:31.229 --> 00:25:32.564 line:95%,end
-MELISSA: Yes, you are.
-I'm not ready.

00:25:32.631 --> 00:25:34.199 line:95%,end
Mom, I'm not ready.

00:25:35.367 --> 00:25:36.568 line:95%,end
I'm not.

00:25:36.635 --> 00:25:38.003 line:95%,end
I'm not ready.

00:25:38.069 --> 00:25:39.137 line:95%,end
-I don't want to...
-MELISSA: Yes, you are.

00:25:39.204 --> 00:25:40.038 line:95%,end
RAY: All right, let's keep going.

00:25:40.105 --> 00:25:42.541 line:95%,end
-Ready. Here we go.
-No, I don't want--

00:25:42.607 --> 00:25:43.975 line:95%,end
RAY: She'll be back. Ready.

00:25:45.877 --> 00:25:47.712 line:95%,end
He's clueless, he can't do it.

00:25:47.779 --> 00:25:49.548 line:95%,end
ABBY: Mackenzie runs out of the group

00:25:49.614 --> 00:25:51.917 line:95%,end
over to mommy, crying.

00:25:51.983 --> 00:25:54.419 line:95%,end
Big temper tantrum
because she doesn't want to do it.

00:25:54.486 --> 00:25:56.288 line:95%,end
She's not ready. She doesn't want
to do it. She's not ready.

00:25:56.354 --> 00:25:58.990 line:95%,end
Listen to me, you cannot act
like this and cry

00:25:59.057 --> 00:26:01.359 line:95%,end
because you become difficult to work with.

00:26:01.426 --> 00:26:03.628 line:95%,end
People don't want to work
with kids who are difficult.

00:26:03.695 --> 00:26:04.796 line:95%,end
You are professional.

00:26:04.863 --> 00:26:06.097 line:95%,end
You are representing me.

00:26:06.164 --> 00:26:07.699 line:95%,end
If I didn't think you could do the dance,

00:26:07.766 --> 00:26:09.167 line:95%,end
you wouldn't have been at the audition.

00:26:09.234 --> 00:26:11.303 line:95%,end
If the choreographer
didn't think you could do it,

00:26:11.369 --> 00:26:13.338 line:95%,end
he would have come to me
and said, look, this kid's not ready.

00:26:13.405 --> 00:26:14.439 line:95%,end
Give me another kid.

00:26:14.506 --> 00:26:16.341 line:95%,end
Do you understand? I believe you.

00:26:16.408 --> 00:26:18.310 line:95%,end
She believes you,
and the choreographer believes in you.

00:26:18.376 --> 00:26:19.411 line:95%,end
You need to believe in yourself.

00:26:19.477 --> 00:26:20.712 line:95%,end
You know the dance, babe.

00:26:20.779 --> 00:26:22.547 line:95%,end
Right now,
we're in a professional atmosphere.

00:26:22.614 --> 00:26:25.483 line:95%,end
<i>I can not have Mackenzie crying on set.</i>

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:27.886 line:95%,end
She is going to ruin
her reputation in this business

00:26:27.953 --> 00:26:29.087 line:95%,end
before it even starts.

00:26:29.154 --> 00:26:30.355 line:95%,end
Maddie, you're going to go with Philip.

00:26:30.422 --> 00:26:31.723 line:95%,end
Nia, you're going to go with Anthony.

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:32.691 line:95%,end
Let's try that split.

00:26:32.757 --> 00:26:33.792 line:95%,end
Ready?

00:26:33.858 --> 00:26:35.627 line:95%,end
Five, six, seven, eight.

00:26:35.694 --> 00:26:37.896 line:95%,end
Drop one, up...

00:26:37.963 --> 00:26:38.930 line:95%,end
Philip, you got to hold her, bud.

00:26:38.997 --> 00:26:40.599 line:95%,end
MADDIE: I filled in for Mackenzie.

00:26:40.665 --> 00:26:42.133 line:95%,end
I wanted to help out.

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.702 line:95%,end
I can dance with anybody.

00:26:44.402 --> 00:26:46.705 line:95%,end
Do you want to try it
with Anthony or Ethan?

00:26:47.973 --> 00:26:48.807 line:95%,end
-Yeah?
-Sure.

00:26:48.873 --> 00:26:50.108 line:95%,end
RAY: Let's try it with Anthony.

00:26:50.175 --> 00:26:51.009 line:95%,end
Try it from the top.

00:26:52.477 --> 00:26:54.746 line:95%,end
One, two, Three, and four.

00:26:54.813 --> 00:26:56.982 line:95%,end
five, six, seven, eight.

00:26:57.048 --> 00:26:59.050 line:95%,end
One and two, three and four,

00:26:59.117 --> 00:27:01.853 line:95%,end
five, six, seven, eight, up one.

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:03.254 line:95%,end
That was better, Mackenzie.

00:27:03.321 --> 00:27:04.456 line:95%,end
See, you know it.

00:27:04.522 --> 00:27:06.491 line:5%,start
MACKENZIE: I just cry sometimes.
It's no big deal.

00:27:06.558 --> 00:27:07.626 line:95%,end
Isn't he cute?

00:27:07.692 --> 00:27:08.593 line:95%,end
He looks like William, kind of.

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:09.928 line:95%,end
Did you see what he did? Hi!

00:27:09.995 --> 00:27:11.529 line:95%,end
-Good to see you, again.
-Good to see you, too.

00:27:11.596 --> 00:27:12.430 line:95%,end
How's everything.

00:27:12.497 --> 00:27:13.798 line:95%,end
HOLLY: <i>The producer Seven arrives.</i>

00:27:13.865 --> 00:27:17.202 line:95%,end
And of course,
he immediately sees Melissa.

00:27:17.268 --> 00:27:18.670 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>And gives her a big ol' hug.</i>

00:27:18.737 --> 00:27:20.105 line:95%,end
<i>Hi, how are you?</i>

00:27:20.171 --> 00:27:21.473 line:95%,end
<i>It's so lovely to see you again.</i>

00:27:22.007 --> 00:27:25.410 line:95%,end
And I'm thinking, like,
I could be out in the back,

00:27:25.477 --> 00:27:27.245 line:95%,end
and he wouldn't even notice
anybody's missing

00:27:27.312 --> 00:27:29.314 line:95%,end
because I'm not his coffee-mate.

00:27:30.048 --> 00:27:30.882 line:95%,end
Hey, girls.

00:27:30.949 --> 00:27:32.050 line:95%,end
Guys, scoot in.

00:27:32.117 --> 00:27:33.518 line:95%,end
So LUX wants to meet you.

00:27:33.585 --> 00:27:34.853 line:95%,end
She wants to spend some time with you,

00:27:34.919 --> 00:27:37.389 line:95%,end
and is really excited to see

00:27:37.455 --> 00:27:39.891 line:95%,end
which one of you
is going to get to play little LUX.

00:27:39.958 --> 00:27:41.660 line:95%,end
Come inside with me, okay?

00:27:41.726 --> 00:27:43.395 line:95%,end
Come on. Let's go to the big room.


00:27:44.295 --> 00:27:45.597 line:95%,end
We're finally going to meet LUX.

00:27:45.664 --> 00:27:46.531 line:95%,end
RAY: Good luck, ladies.

00:27:46.598 --> 00:27:47.999 line:5%,start
I'm so excited!

00:27:48.533 --> 00:27:50.001 line:95%,end
-Hi!
-Hi.

00:27:50.068 --> 00:27:51.036 line:95%,end
Hey.

00:27:52.604 --> 00:27:54.105 line:5%,start
-How are you?
-Good.

00:27:54.172 --> 00:27:55.740 line:5%,start
-I'm LUX.
-GIRLS: Hi.

00:27:55.807 --> 00:27:57.709 line:95%,end
It's nice to meet you.
What are your names?

00:27:58.476 --> 00:27:59.511 line:95%,end
Nia.

00:27:59.577 --> 00:28:00.845 line:95%,end
-Chloe.
-Maddie.

00:28:00.912 --> 00:28:01.880 line:95%,end
-Mackenzie.
-Brooke

00:28:01.946 --> 00:28:03.148 line:95%,end
LUX: Nice to meet you.

00:28:03.214 --> 00:28:04.916 line:95%,end
-GIRLS: Nice to meet you.
-You girls are beautiful.

00:28:04.983 --> 00:28:06.284 line:95%,end
GIRLS: Thank you.

00:28:06.351 --> 00:28:09.187 line:95%,end
MADDIE: <i>We met LUX,</i>
<i>and she is so beautiful,</i>

00:28:09.254 --> 00:28:11.823 line:95%,end
and she has a great voice.

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:14.325 line:95%,end
And she has a lot of star quality.

00:28:14.392 --> 00:28:16.327 line:95%,end
<i>I hope I get chosen as LUX.</i>

00:28:16.394 --> 00:28:17.395 line:95%,end
Are you from here?

00:28:17.462 --> 00:28:18.530 line:95%,end
No, we're from Pittsburgh.

00:28:18.596 --> 00:28:19.898 line:95%,end
All of you are from Pittsburgh?

00:28:19.964 --> 00:28:21.099 line:95%,end
-Yeah.
-Far away.

00:28:21.166 --> 00:28:24.703 line:95%,end
LUX: Wow. One of you is going to be
playing a miniature me.

00:28:25.437 --> 00:28:28.440 line:95%,end
I'm so excited to do this with you guys.

00:28:28.506 --> 00:28:30.742 line:95%,end
So are we.

00:28:30.809 --> 00:28:32.310 line:95%,end
-Yeah.
-So are we.

00:28:32.377 --> 00:28:33.645 line:95%,end
MAN: All right, time to go.

00:28:33.712 --> 00:28:35.447 line:95%,end
-Thank you.
-MAN: It's time to go.

00:28:36.147 --> 00:28:38.049 line:95%,end
(indistinct chatter)

00:28:38.116 --> 00:28:40.485 line:95%,end
BROOKE: <i>After seeing LUX</i>
<i>for the first time,</i>

00:28:40.552 --> 00:28:43.321 line:5%,start
I realized that if you want
to be a little LUX,

00:28:43.388 --> 00:28:44.589 line:5%,start
you have to look like LUX.

00:28:44.656 --> 00:28:46.725 line:95%,end
SEVEN: So girls, these are our directors.

00:28:46.791 --> 00:28:47.959 line:95%,end
Over here, we've got my man, Ben.

00:28:48.026 --> 00:28:49.194 line:5%,start
-GIRLS: Hi.
-SEVEN: And we have Tony.

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:50.528 line:5%,start
Hello, ladies.

00:28:50.595 --> 00:28:52.697 line:95%,end
SEVEN: The idea here is we want
to see what you guys have,

00:28:52.764 --> 00:28:54.833 line:95%,end
so we can make a decision

00:28:54.899 --> 00:28:57.202 line:95%,end
on who's going to be the lead
for the music video.

00:28:57.268 --> 00:28:59.504 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>So the producer</i>
<i>and the director tell the girls,</i>

00:28:59.571 --> 00:29:02.841 line:95%,end
<i>first thing they have to do</i>
<i>is kind of a catwalk with some poses.</i>

00:29:02.907 --> 00:29:04.609 line:95%,end
<i>I think it's nerve-wracking</i>
<i>for the girls there</i>

00:29:04.676 --> 00:29:06.511 line:95%,end
<i>when you have 50 people</i>
<i>all standing there,</i>

00:29:06.578 --> 00:29:07.846 line:95%,end
eyes on you with cameras.

00:29:07.912 --> 00:29:09.047 line:95%,end
And they're kind of like--

00:29:09.114 --> 00:29:10.548 line:95%,end
there's not just three judges.

00:29:10.615 --> 00:29:12.884 line:95%,end
It's 40 judges, plus all of us

00:29:12.951 --> 00:29:15.386 line:95%,end
and your competition sitting there
watching what you're doing.

00:29:15.887 --> 00:29:16.921 line:95%,end
Excited?

00:29:16.988 --> 00:29:18.223 line:95%,end
Let's do this.

00:29:19.491 --> 00:29:21.226 line:95%,end
Go, Maddie! Go!

00:29:23.461 --> 00:29:25.997 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>Maddie just walking across</i>
<i>that set like she owns it,</i>

00:29:26.064 --> 00:29:28.833 line:95%,end
like she's in her bedroom
and nobody's watching.

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:29.834 line:95%,end
<i>She has it.</i>

00:29:29.901 --> 00:29:30.935 line:95%,end
<i>It's in the bag.</i>

00:29:31.002 --> 00:29:34.639 line:95%,end
I work the catwalk,
and I think I did really good with it

00:29:34.706 --> 00:29:35.740 line:95%,end
and the poses.

00:29:35.807 --> 00:29:38.109 line:95%,end
SEVEN: Keep rolling, keep rolling.
Let's get Mackenzie back in position.

00:29:38.176 --> 00:29:39.511 line:95%,end
We'll do it once without the music.

00:29:39.577 --> 00:29:41.246 line:95%,end
And three, two, one, go!

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:43.815 line:95%,end
Very cute.

00:29:45.383 --> 00:29:48.086 line:95%,end
Stage and walk out.

00:29:50.355 --> 00:29:51.856 line:95%,end
Fabulous, gorgeous.

00:29:51.923 --> 00:29:54.359 line:95%,end
We're all set, let's go, Chloe. Let's go.

00:29:54.425 --> 00:29:55.293 line:95%,end
Here we go.

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:56.861 line:95%,end
MADDIE: <i>I don't think</i>
<i>it's much about talent.</i>

00:29:56.928 --> 00:29:58.363 line:95%,end
<i>I think it's about the look.</i>

00:29:58.429 --> 00:30:00.365 line:95%,end
<i>And the thing I'm worried about</i>

00:30:00.431 --> 00:30:04.435 line:95%,end
<i>is that Chloe has the same hair as LUX.</i>

00:30:05.036 --> 00:30:07.438 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>For the music video,</i>
<i>the person determining the lead</i>

00:30:07.505 --> 00:30:10.308 line:95%,end
<i>is the director and the producer</i>
<i>of the music video.</i>

00:30:10.375 --> 00:30:11.676 line:95%,end
It's not Abby.

00:30:11.743 --> 00:30:13.745 line:95%,end
So for once,
there is an even playing field,

00:30:13.812 --> 00:30:15.113 line:95%,end
and Chloe has a chance.

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:16.414 line:95%,end
And action Brooke.

00:30:18.216 --> 00:30:19.784 line:95%,end
Nice, Brooke.

00:30:19.851 --> 00:30:20.685 line:95%,end
Nia.

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:24.088 line:95%,end
(gasp)

00:30:24.155 --> 00:30:25.590 line:95%,end
Very good. Very original.

00:30:25.657 --> 00:30:27.258 line:95%,end
-I thought you got hurt.
-Yeah.

00:30:27.325 --> 00:30:29.194 line:95%,end
-I thought she lost it.
-It's called the death drop.

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:30.562 line:95%,end
SEVEN: I thought
that was a trap door I just--

00:30:30.628 --> 00:30:31.830 line:95%,end
I know.

00:30:31.896 --> 00:30:33.264 line:95%,end
I thought somebody took you away.

00:30:33.331 --> 00:30:35.166 line:95%,end
NIA: <i>I knew I wasn't going to get the lead</i>

00:30:35.233 --> 00:30:39.137 line:5%,start
because we had to be
like her as a little kid.

00:30:39.604 --> 00:30:41.539 line:95%,end
<i>And I'm African American.</i>

00:30:41.606 --> 00:30:43.174 line:95%,end
<i>I have brown hair.</i>

00:30:43.241 --> 00:30:45.610 line:95%,end
<i>I think I made a really good impression.</i>

00:30:45.677 --> 00:30:46.978 line:95%,end
(chuckles)

00:30:47.045 --> 00:30:48.546 line:95%,end
Thank you so much.

00:30:48.613 --> 00:30:52.317 line:95%,end
We had a fun time watching you
and a great time working with you.

00:30:52.383 --> 00:30:54.652 line:95%,end
ABBY: If they're looking
for the strongest dancer short,

00:30:54.719 --> 00:30:55.553 line:95%,end
it's going to be Maddie.

00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:57.388 line:95%,end
If they're looking
for the strongest dancer tall,

00:30:57.455 --> 00:30:58.456 line:95%,end
it's going to be Chloe.

<i>I don't know what's required of the lead.</i>

00:31:02.827 --> 00:31:05.296 line:95%,end
I definitely think this one
is just way too young.

00:31:05.363 --> 00:31:06.497 line:95%,end
I think Brooke is just too old.

00:31:06.564 --> 00:31:07.432 line:95%,end
Here's what I feel.

00:31:07.498 --> 00:31:10.168 line:95%,end
I feel like our couple
is Maddie and Chloe.

00:31:10.235 --> 00:31:11.469 line:95%,end
That's what you're thinking?

00:31:11.536 --> 00:31:13.872 line:95%,end
CHLOE: I really, really, really want to be

00:31:13.938 --> 00:31:15.039 line:95%,end
the younger version of LUX.

00:31:15.106 --> 00:31:17.041 line:95%,end
It would be a dream come true for me.

00:31:17.108 --> 00:31:18.843 line:95%,end
Girls, you did an amazing job.

00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:23.381 line:95%,end
And this is unlike just going out
for a dance competition.

00:31:23.448 --> 00:31:24.849 line:95%,end
There are many different levels to this.

00:31:24.916 --> 00:31:27.819 line:95%,end
There's not only your dance ability,

00:31:27.886 --> 00:31:29.254 line:95%,end
but your acting ability.

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:32.290 line:95%,end
And then it comes down
to a certain essence or quality.

00:31:32.357 --> 00:31:35.426 line:95%,end
MELISSA: <i>Of course, every girl</i>
<i>wants to lead in this,</i>

00:31:35.493 --> 00:31:37.695 line:95%,end
<i>but we all pretty much know</i>
<i>that Maddie will get it.</i>

00:31:37.762 --> 00:31:39.797 line:95%,end
And naturally,
kids are going to be jealous.

00:31:39.864 --> 00:31:41.599 line:95%,end
It's just a natural thing.

00:31:41.666 --> 00:31:43.568 line:95%,end
SEVEN: For this particular role,

00:31:43.635 --> 00:31:47.739 line:95%,end
we need to find someone
that comes as close to looking like LUX

00:31:47.805 --> 00:31:50.074 line:95%,end
and feeling like LUX as possible.

00:31:50.141 --> 00:31:52.443 line:95%,end
MADDIE: <i>Chloe is nervous a lot,</i>
<i>she tells me.</i>

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:54.178 line:95%,end
<i>She doesn't have self-confidence.</i>

00:31:54.245 --> 00:31:55.947 line:95%,end
<i>I have a lot of confidence.</i>

00:31:56.014 --> 00:31:59.284 line:95%,end
And I think I have a good chance
of being the lead.

00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:02.020 line:95%,end
For those reasons,
and based on your talent

00:32:02.086 --> 00:32:03.121 line:95%,end
and your combined efforts.

00:32:03.187 --> 00:32:04.956 line:95%,end
At the end of the day,
we have to make a decision

00:32:05.023 --> 00:32:07.225 line:95%,end
about what's going to be best
for the video.


00:32:10.261 --> 00:32:11.896 line:5%,start
For this particular role,

00:32:11.963 --> 00:32:15.500 line:95%,end
we need to find someone that comes

00:32:16.901 --> 00:32:18.670 line:95%,end

we have to make a decision

00:32:18.736 --> 00:32:21.005 line:95%,end

00:32:21.072 --> 00:32:23.641 line:95%,end
CHLOE: <i>I think my biggest competition</i>
<i>for the music video</i>

00:32:23.708 --> 00:32:26.177 line:95%,end
<i>is probably going to be Maddie</i>

00:32:26.244 --> 00:32:28.446 line:95%,end
<i>because she's good,</i>

00:32:28.513 --> 00:32:30.915 line:95%,end
and she also has the look.

00:32:31.482 --> 00:32:32.650 line:95%,end
With everything that I mentioned before,

00:32:32.717 --> 00:32:34.485 line:95%,end
I think that I have to...

00:32:36.554 --> 00:32:39.824 line:95%,end
(suspenseful music playing)

00:32:43.528 --> 00:32:45.163 line:95%,end
We have to go with Chloe.

00:32:45.897 --> 00:32:49.200 line:95%,end
Because Chloe, you've got that thing

00:32:49.267 --> 00:32:50.868 line:95%,end
that's just working
for this video right now.

00:32:50.935 --> 00:32:54.172 line:5%,start
CHLOE: Seven just so that I am LUX
when she's little,

00:32:54.238 --> 00:32:55.239 line:5%,start
and I'm so excited.

00:32:55.306 --> 00:32:57.342 line:5%,start
I finally did it.

00:32:57.408 --> 00:32:58.710 line:95%,end
I made it big in Hollywood.

00:33:01.846 --> 00:33:05.283 line:5%,start
CHISTI: When Seven announced
that Chloe had the lead in the video...

00:33:06.985 --> 00:33:09.387 line:95%,end
I was so happy for my daughter.

00:33:09.454 --> 00:33:11.255 line:95%,end
She's worked so hard,

00:33:11.322 --> 00:33:14.025 line:95%,end
and she's really overcome a lot.

00:33:14.092 --> 00:33:17.829 line:95%,end
<i>And I wanted her to get</i>
<i>an opportunity to feel special.</i>

00:33:17.895 --> 00:33:19.797 line:95%,end
And this was a pretty good one.

00:33:19.864 --> 00:33:21.532 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Okay, the boys are here, girls.

00:33:21.599 --> 00:33:23.234 line:95%,end
I'm so happy for you.

00:33:23.301 --> 00:33:26.671 line:5%,start
MELISSA: So when Seven announces
that Chloe got the lead,

00:33:26.738 --> 00:33:28.806 line:95%,end
<i>Christi, of course, was so happy.</i>

00:33:28.873 --> 00:33:30.174 line:95%,end
<i>And we were happy, too,</i>

00:33:30.241 --> 00:33:32.443 line:95%,end
<i>because I want all the girls</i>
<i>to get a chance.</i>

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:35.079 line:95%,end
I know this wasn't
on their dance ability at all

00:33:35.146 --> 00:33:38.750 line:95%,end
because my daughter
would have made it to the top.

00:33:38.816 --> 00:33:40.918 line:95%,end
MADDIE: <i>I don't ever cry or anything</i>

00:33:40.985 --> 00:33:42.420 line:95%,end
<i>like some other people do</i>

00:33:42.487 --> 00:33:44.055 line:95%,end
<i>if they don't get the lead part.</i>

00:33:44.122 --> 00:33:47.658 line:5%,start
I am happy for the other girls,
and I'm happy for me, too.

00:33:49.927 --> 00:33:51.229 line:95%,end
Guys (indistinct) line in.

00:33:51.295 --> 00:33:52.563 line:95%,end
Watch out, Maddie.

00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:53.598 line:95%,end
Let's just rehearse this real quick.

00:33:53.664 --> 00:33:55.466 line:95%,end
Let's just slowly move the camera back.

00:33:55.533 --> 00:33:57.635 line:95%,end
So, Chloe turns.

00:33:57.702 --> 00:33:58.970 line:95%,end
Camera moves.

00:33:59.804 --> 00:34:01.139 line:95%,end
Oh, don't beat the camera.

00:34:01.205 --> 00:34:04.609 line:95%,end
The camera is moving on
a very heavy rig, okay?

00:34:04.675 --> 00:34:07.011 line:95%,end
This can be very dangerous.

00:34:07.078 --> 00:34:08.613 line:95%,end
I want you guys to have a good time

00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:11.549 line:95%,end
and dance great,
but just watch out for this, okay?

00:34:11.616 --> 00:34:13.117 line:95%,end
If it hits your head, it will hurt.

00:34:13.184 --> 00:34:14.452 line:95%,end
Action. Go, Chloe!

00:34:17.155 --> 00:34:18.956 line:95%,end
Keep going, keep going. Big energy!

00:34:22.193 --> 00:34:23.661 line:95%,end
More fans! Fans!

00:34:23.728 --> 00:34:26.364 line:95%,end
Fans on the girls!
Put the fans on the girls!

-Cut! Let's do this.
-MAN: Cut camera.

Guys, can we put the foggers
directly behind the ritter fan?

00:34:31.335 --> 00:34:32.503 line:95%,end
Roll playback.

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:33.771 line:95%,end
Smoke it up!

00:34:33.838 --> 00:34:35.239 line:95%,end
Don't move (bleep).

00:34:36.207 --> 00:34:37.408 line:95%,end
We're running out of time, here.

00:34:37.475 --> 00:34:39.410 line:95%,end

Feathers, feathers!

00:34:56.694 --> 00:34:59.664 line:95%,end
And then sometimes
you don't know where you're going.

MELISSA: Ironically, you know,
all the moms want their daughter

to be the lead.

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:11.609 line:95%,end
However, this really worked
to Maddie's advantage

00:35:11.676 --> 00:35:12.743 line:95%,end
<i>not having the lead.</i>

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:13.945 line:95%,end
<i>Abby said it to me, too.</i>

00:35:14.011 --> 00:35:16.881 line:95%,end
Wow, aren't you glad
Maddie didn't get the lead

00:35:16.948 --> 00:35:19.584 line:95%,end
because she's dancing the entire time.

00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:21.752 line:95%,end
<i>So some agent is going to see her dance,</i>

00:35:21.819 --> 00:35:23.087 line:95%,end

00:35:24.622 --> 00:35:26.591 line:95%,end
All right, cut! Cut!

Chloe's had a hard season.

She has been compared a lot to Maddie,

00:35:47.812 --> 00:35:51.349 line:95%,end
<i>and she's never really amounted</i>
<i>too much in Abby's eyes.</i>

00:35:51.415 --> 00:35:54.385 line:95%,end
And believe it or not,
as hard as Abby is on our kids,

00:35:54.452 --> 00:35:56.787 line:95%,end
they still want her approval.

00:35:56.854 --> 00:36:00.024 line:95%,end

00:36:00.091 --> 00:36:01.292 line:95%,end

00:36:01.359 --> 00:36:04.495 line:95%,end
