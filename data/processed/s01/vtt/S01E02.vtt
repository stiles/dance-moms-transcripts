ABBY: This is where it all starts.

00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:05.839 line:5%,start
We are preparing
for the National Competition.

00:00:06.272 --> 00:00:07.807 line:5%,start
Watch that right elbow.

00:00:07.874 --> 00:00:11.311 line:5%,start
I would like to see her
compete with you this weekend.

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:12.212 line:5%,start
This weekend?

00:00:12.278 --> 00:00:13.346 line:5%,start
<i>Vivi auditioned.</i>

00:00:13.413 --> 00:00:14.681 line:5%,start
<i>I thought it was ridiculous.</i>

00:00:14.748 --> 00:00:16.983 line:5%,start
<i>Every weekend we go to new competition.</i>

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.385 line:5%,start
(cheering)

00:00:20.787 --> 00:00:21.955 line:5%,start
ABBY: <i>These moms are ridiculous.</i>

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:23.556 line:5%,start
<i>They are in a bar drinking,</i>

00:00:23.623 --> 00:00:25.892 line:5%,start
<i>and their kid needs to be on stage</i>
<i>in five minutes.</i>

00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:27.394 line:5%,start
You're in the bar having a drink,

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.595 line:5%,start
<i>and her headpiece is falling off.</i>

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:30.263 line:5%,start
Abby, mistakes happen. We're human.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.399 line:5%,start
You are. Mistakes like that
don't happen to me.

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:33.566 line:5%,start
I'm done.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.035 line:5%,start
Phoenix was rough.

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:36.102 line:5%,start
You guys got your butts kicked.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.471 line:5%,start
<i>The new number will be hot.</i>

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:39.839 line:5%,start
<i>It's gonna be sizzling.</i>

00:00:39.906 --> 00:00:40.907 line:5%,start
And that's way too sexy.

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:45.011 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: I guess she's setting us up
for another Maddie, Chloe showdown.

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:47.414 line:5%,start
MADDIE: <i>Chloe is my biggest competitor.</i>

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.149 line:5%,start
<i>I think I'm a little bit better than her</i>

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:51.684 line:5%,start
<i>because I've won many awards than her.</i>

00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:53.186 line:5%,start
HOLLY: <i>That was over the top,</i>

00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:54.654 line:5%,start
inappropriate for a little girls.

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:56.423 line:5%,start
That left me very uncomfortable

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.491 line:5%,start
to see my little girl smacking her butt.

00:00:58.558 --> 00:01:00.193 line:5%,start
Well, then maybe you should not come.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.396 line:5%,start
When a parent opens their mouth,
they are ruining their child.

00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:11.137 line:95%,end
SINGER: <i>âª Get up, get on the floor âª</i>

00:01:11.204 --> 00:01:16.776 line:95%,end
<i>âª My world is with my girls</i>
<i>living on the dance floor âª</i>

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.313 line:5%,start
(tense music playing)

00:01:23.883 --> 00:01:24.851 line:95%,end
Phoenix was rough.

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:26.953 line:95%,end
You guys got your butts kicked.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.123 line:5%,start
ANNOUNCER: <i>Third place goes to</i>
<i>Abby Lee Dance Company</i>

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.358 line:5%,start
<i>for "Party, Party, Party."</i>

00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:33.560 line:95%,end
ABBY: Here in Pittsburgh,

00:01:33.626 --> 00:01:35.128 line:95%,end
you have won everything,

00:01:35.195 --> 00:01:37.297 line:95%,end
but it's clearly a different story

00:01:37.363 --> 00:01:39.532 line:95%,end
when you get on a plane
and fly across the country.

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:42.502 line:95%,end
For years, I took the kids by myself.

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:44.170 line:95%,end
I made sure their hair was right.

00:01:44.237 --> 00:01:45.805 line:95%,end
I made sure the makeup was right.

00:01:45.872 --> 00:01:47.107 line:95%,end
I put the headpiece on.

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:48.641 line:95%,end
All the mothers wanna go now

00:01:48.708 --> 00:01:50.777 line:95%,end
because they are reliving

00:01:50.844 --> 00:01:53.079 line:95%,end
their childhood through all of you.

00:01:53.146 --> 00:01:55.482 line:95%,end
And that's when the trouble happens.

00:01:55.548 --> 00:01:56.716 line:95%,end
I am the leader.

00:01:56.783 --> 00:01:57.650 line:95%,end
I am the teacher.

00:01:57.717 --> 00:01:59.018 line:95%,end
You do what I say.

00:01:59.085 --> 00:02:01.354 line:95%,end
When your mother is telling you
something else to do,

00:02:01.421 --> 00:02:02.956 line:95%,end
that becomes a conflict.

00:02:03.022 --> 00:02:04.157 line:95%,end
Do you understand that?

00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:06.793 line:95%,end
Now, Nia, how do you think you did?

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.298 line:95%,end
What do you need to improve?

00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:14.134 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>Yes</i>.

00:02:14.534 --> 00:02:15.468 line:95%,end
<i>Very sloppy.</i>

00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:18.671 line:95%,end
<i>The feet, the legs,</i>
<i>the shoulders, your arms.</i>

00:02:19.706 --> 00:02:22.742 line:95%,end
The same mistakes over and over and over,

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:24.244 line:95%,end
and that pulls the group down.

00:02:25.278 --> 00:02:28.681 line:95%,end
MADDIE: <i>Abby yells at people</i>
<i>a little bit too much,</i>

00:02:28.748 --> 00:02:32.085 line:5%,start
but I think that's just because
she wants them to be a better dancer,

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:33.653 line:5%,start
and she really cares about us.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.488 line:95%,end
Chloe, the headband was bad.

00:02:35.555 --> 00:02:38.124 line:95%,end
(cheering)

00:02:40.493 --> 00:02:41.861 line:95%,end
Next time, what are you gonna do?

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:44.164 line:95%,end
Make sure my headpiece stays on.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.832 line:95%,end
Could you have prevented that?

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:47.734 line:95%,end
Yes.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.169 line:5%,start
Abby is very scary.

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:50.503 line:5%,start
Abby's terrifying to me.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.107 line:5%,start
She has a deep voice
that you will be very afraid of.

00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:55.742 line:95%,end
Who's afraid of it? You?

00:02:55.808 --> 00:02:57.477 line:95%,end
-I don't know.
-I'm a little afraid of it.

00:02:58.478 --> 00:02:59.312 line:95%,end
See?

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:00.213 line:95%,end
Okay.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.315 line:95%,end
The new number will be
called "Electricity."

00:03:02.382 --> 00:03:03.616 line:95%,end
Everybody say that.

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:04.817 line:95%,end
ALL: "Electricity."

00:03:04.884 --> 00:03:06.319 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>The group number "Electricity"</i>

00:03:06.386 --> 00:03:10.623 line:95%,end
is what I would refer to
as West Coast Jazz or LA Jazz.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:11.591 line:95%,end
<i>It's hot.</i>

00:03:11.658 --> 00:03:12.959 line:95%,end
<i>It's sassy.</i>

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:15.028 line:95%,end
It's what you would see in a music video.

00:03:15.094 --> 00:03:17.063 line:95%,end
<i>So hopefully it's gonna step these kids up</i>

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.133 line:95%,end
<i>to the next level,</i>
<i>and we're going to see something</i>

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.634 line:95%,end
<i>from them we've never seen before.</i>

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:26.039 line:95%,end
Maddie, because you were
great this weekend...

00:03:26.105 --> 00:03:29.142 line:95%,end
(cheering)

00:03:30.777 --> 00:03:32.278 line:95%,end
...you didn't give me any trouble,

00:03:32.345 --> 00:03:34.013 line:95%,end
your mother didn't give me any trouble,

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.583 line:95%,end
you're gonna be in the front,
in the center

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:38.151 line:95%,end
for the beginning of the routine.

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:40.420 line:95%,end
MADDIE: <i>I'm not trying to be rude,</i>

00:03:40.486 --> 00:03:43.223 line:5%,start
but I'm probably one of the best dancers
in my group.

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:45.525 line:95%,end
Everybody's goal should be right here.

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:47.060 line:95%,end
Yes?

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:48.494 line:95%,end
Okay.

00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:50.230 line:95%,end
Two solos will be competing.

00:03:50.296 --> 00:03:52.365 line:5%,start
Maddie, you will be
doing one of your solos,

00:03:52.432 --> 00:03:55.001 line:5%,start
and, Chloe, you will be
doing one of your solos.

00:03:55.802 --> 00:03:57.103 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>Melissa does not like me</i>

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.905 line:95%,end
because Chloe's Maddie's
biggest competition.

00:03:58.972 --> 00:04:01.708 line:95%,end
She doesn't like that,
and to be honest, I don't like Melissa.

00:04:01.774 --> 00:04:03.243 line:95%,end
<i>I know her true colors.</i>

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:04.344 line:95%,end
All right. Everybody up.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.511 line:95%,end
I wanna start this number.

00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:07.647 line:95%,end
Moms, you are dismissed. Thank you.

00:04:08.314 --> 00:04:09.849 line:5%,start
(uplifting music playing)

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:11.317 line:5%,start
ABBY: Up, down, down.

00:04:11.384 --> 00:04:12.218 line:5%,start
Switch foot.

00:04:12.285 --> 00:04:13.119 line:5%,start
Step, hit.

00:04:13.186 --> 00:04:14.153 line:5%,start
Ball change.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.990 line:95%,end
<i>This weekend we're going</i>
<i>to StarQuest Competition</i>

00:04:17.056 --> 00:04:18.591 line:95%,end
<i>in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.</i>

00:04:18.658 --> 00:04:20.460 line:5%,start
<i>And the girls are doing all new numbers.</i>

00:04:20.526 --> 00:04:22.295 line:5%,start
Sassy, that's not skipping.

00:04:25.898 --> 00:04:29.335 line:95%,end
Here we are, sitting here
like a bunch of jackasses.

00:04:31.337 --> 00:04:33.473 line:5%,start
<i>I would say Maddie and Chloe</i>
<i>go back and forth</i>

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:34.807 line:5%,start
<i>for the best dancer in the group.</i>

00:04:34.874 --> 00:04:37.577 line:5%,start
<i>And my goal this season really</i>
<i>is for Chloe to beat Maddie,</i>

00:04:37.644 --> 00:04:39.846 line:95%,end
<i>so if she wants to be the best,</i>
<i>she has to beat the best.</i>

00:04:39.912 --> 00:04:41.247 line:95%,end
And Maddie's the best.

00:04:41.314 --> 00:04:43.216 line:95%,end
Listen, dance good, okay?

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:44.117 line:95%,end
Okay.

00:04:44.183 --> 00:04:45.551 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>I do feel like I push her,</i>

00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:48.354 line:95%,end
<i>but it's my job as Chloe's mother</i>
<i>to motivate her</i>

00:04:48.421 --> 00:04:50.390 line:95%,end
<i>because I feel Chloe has star potential.</i>

00:04:52.191 --> 00:04:53.960 line:95%,end
KELLY: Did you hear that talk in there?

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.428 line:95%,end
Be like Maddie.

00:04:55.495 --> 00:04:56.629 line:95%,end
Be like Maddie.

HOLLY: Who was at
the bottom of the pyramid?


00:04:58.564 --> 00:05:00.733 line:95%,end
Nia's at the bottom of the pyramid,
and it's not right.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.502 line:95%,end
Brooke's at the bottom of the pyramid.

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:04.837 line:95%,end
No, Nia's at the bottom of the pyramid.

00:05:04.904 --> 00:05:05.738 line:95%,end
KELLY: So is Brooke.

00:05:05.805 --> 00:05:07.874 line:95%,end
She's with Nia and McKenzie.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.243 line:95%,end
Well, okay, but Nia--

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.378 line:95%,end
Step up and it's like, ha.

00:05:12.445 --> 00:05:13.379 line:95%,end
Yeah?

00:05:13.446 --> 00:05:14.514 line:95%,end
Throw it out there. Do it again.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.516 line:95%,end
HOLLY: <i>Anyone else, there was</i>
<i>something wrong with what they did,</i>

00:05:16.582 --> 00:05:18.084 line:95%,end
but Maddie had nothing wrong.

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:18.985 line:95%,end
She was perfect.

00:05:19.052 --> 00:05:20.520 line:95%,end
That makes my kids feel bad.

00:05:20.586 --> 00:05:23.556 line:95%,end
I guess she's setting us up
for another Maddie, Chloe showdown.

00:05:23.623 --> 00:05:24.824 line:95%,end
<i>It'll be the same old, same old.</i>

00:05:24.891 --> 00:05:26.059 line:95%,end
<i>You know, Abby will be working with Maddie</i>

00:05:26.125 --> 00:05:27.226 line:95%,end
<i>right before she goes on stage,</i>

00:05:27.293 --> 00:05:29.562 line:95%,end
and it will be me
in the back hallway with my daughter

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:31.230 line:95%,end
because that's how it always is.

00:05:31.297 --> 00:05:33.466 line:95%,end
<i>All the focus is on Maddie, and then,</i>

00:05:33.533 --> 00:05:35.168 line:95%,end
there's nothing left for anybody else.

00:05:35.234 --> 00:05:36.269 line:95%,end
Right.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.473 line:5%,start
(upbeat music playing)

00:05:41.307 --> 00:05:43.076 line:95%,end
MELISSA: <i>I don't care</i>
<i>what the other moms think</i>

00:05:43.142 --> 00:05:44.510 line:95%,end
<i>because my kid is the star.</i>

00:05:44.577 --> 00:05:47.413 line:95%,end
And maybe Maddie's the favorite
because she's the best,

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.183 line:95%,end

and she pays attention.

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:54.153 line:95%,end
<i>My goal for Maddie this season</i>

<i>Maddie has what it takes to be a star.</i>

00:05:56.055 --> 00:05:58.091 line:95%,end
<i>She has drive, she has determination,</i>

00:05:58.157 --> 00:05:59.992 line:95%,end
<i>and she's definitely a perfectionist.</i>

00:06:00.493 --> 00:06:02.895 line:95%,end
<i>I think she's the best dancer</i>
<i>in our studio.</i>

00:06:03.463 --> 00:06:06.165 line:95%,end
I don't think the other moms
are jealous of me.

00:06:06.232 --> 00:06:07.533 line:95%,end
<i>They're jealous of my daughter</i>

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.901 line:95%,end

ABBY: One, two, two.

00:06:13.473 --> 00:06:14.374 line:95%,end
Push.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.475 line:95%,end
Pretty.

00:06:15.541 --> 00:06:17.777 line:5%,start
My mom is a brilliant dance teacher,

00:06:17.844 --> 00:06:20.413 line:95%,end
and I am continuing that legacy.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.248 line:95%,end
When I was a young dance student,

00:06:22.315 --> 00:06:26.119 line:95%,end
I realized that my talents
were better used for choreography

00:06:26.185 --> 00:06:29.288 line:95%,end
and behind the scenes
than on stage performing,

00:06:29.355 --> 00:06:32.291 line:95%,end
so I started my own company
at the age of 14.

00:06:33.726 --> 00:06:35.695 line:95%,end
You have to be really hot, sexy.

00:06:35.762 --> 00:06:37.363 line:95%,end
I don't make that move Brooke's doing.

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.631 line:95%,end
That's way too sexy.

00:06:38.698 --> 00:06:40.466 line:95%,end
Make it like you're 17 years old.

00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:43.536 line:95%,end
We're going to Lancaster this weekend

00:06:43.603 --> 00:06:46.406 line:95%,end
for a competition called StarQuest.

00:06:46.472 --> 00:06:48.474 line:95%,end
We don't usually do StarQuest

00:06:48.541 --> 00:06:51.811 line:95%,end
<i>'cause Lancaster's</i>
<i>not like a West Coast town,</i>

00:06:51.878 --> 00:06:57.450 line:95%,end
so I don't know quite how Lancaster's
gonna react to this dance.

00:06:57.517 --> 00:06:58.384 line:95%,end
(laughs)

00:06:58.451 --> 00:07:00.219 line:95%,end
ABBY: One, two, three, four.

00:07:00.586 --> 00:07:03.923 line:95%,end
<i>I created a new number</i>
<i>after being on the West Coast.</i>

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:07.293 line:95%,end
In Phoenix,
the kids are dressed so skimpy,

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.062 line:95%,end
<i>and were so hot and dynamic on stage</i>

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:12.031 line:95%,end
<i>that I wanted to do something similar.</i>

00:07:12.098 --> 00:07:13.132 line:95%,end
This is way too much.

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:14.667 line:95%,end
I don't know how they keep up with it.

00:07:14.734 --> 00:07:16.402 line:95%,end
Five, six, seven, eight.

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:20.706 line:95%,end
You set the tone for the whole dance,
Chloe, so be amazing.

00:07:20.773 --> 00:07:22.008 line:95%,end
<i>I don't care what anybody says.</i>

00:07:22.708 --> 00:07:24.010 line:95%,end
<i>It's my studio.</i>

00:07:24.076 --> 00:07:25.478 line:95%,end
<i>It's my company.</i>

00:07:25.545 --> 00:07:27.213 line:95%,end
<i>The children need a challenge.</i>

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.781 line:95%,end
<i>They need something edgy.</i>

00:07:28.848 --> 00:07:32.685 line:95%,end
I don't have my own children,
but I teach children

00:07:32.752 --> 00:07:34.687 line:95%,end
from three-years-old to 18.

00:07:34.754 --> 00:07:36.689 line:95%,end
I practically raise these kids,

00:07:36.756 --> 00:07:39.025 line:95%,end
and then I send them off
to be professional dancers.

00:07:39.559 --> 00:07:42.094 line:95%,end
<i>There's a quote that I know</i>
<i>that I often use,</i>

00:07:42.161 --> 00:07:45.832 line:95%,end
<i>the best parenting that a parent can do</i>

00:07:45.898 --> 00:07:48.768 line:95%,end
is to raise their child
to survive on their own.

00:07:49.435 --> 00:07:50.503 line:95%,end
And that's what I do.

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:51.871 line:95%,end
I train a kid.

00:07:51.938 --> 00:07:55.141 line:95%,end
I give them every survival skill
that they need

00:07:55.208 --> 00:07:57.677 line:95%,end
to go out in the world
and make it as a professional dancer.

00:07:57.743 --> 00:07:59.545 line:95%,end
And one, two.

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:01.280 line:95%,end
Turn those hands in.

00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:03.516 line:95%,end
Right. More butt.

00:08:03.583 --> 00:08:04.650 line:95%,end
It's all about the butt.

00:08:06.052 --> 00:08:09.055 line:95%,end
(uplifting music playing)

00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:15.328 line:95%,end
A new girl came in to audition.

00:08:15.761 --> 00:08:17.263 line:95%,end
-Oh. How old is she?
-HOLLY: Really?

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.298 line:95%,end
MELISSA: She's 6 and 1/2,

00:08:19.365 --> 00:08:22.235 line:95%,end
and I think Abby's
gonna put her in our group.

00:08:22.902 --> 00:08:24.303 line:95%,end
-I don't know.
-Six?

00:08:25.805 --> 00:08:29.575 line:95%,end
And if you think I'm perky
and happy, oh, my gosh,

00:08:29.642 --> 00:08:30.476 line:95%,end
just wait and see.

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:33.813 line:95%,end
<i>She reminds me of like Mr. Roger's wife.</i>

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.148 line:95%,end
<i>Like, oh my gosh,</i>
<i>she kept highfiving her daughter.</i>

00:08:36.215 --> 00:08:37.316 line:95%,end
You go, girlfriend.

00:08:37.383 --> 00:08:38.784 line:95%,end
And I was like, oh, my gosh.

00:08:38.851 --> 00:08:40.319 line:95%,end
She's actually a dance teacher.

00:08:40.386 --> 00:08:41.921 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Well, if she's a dance teacher,

00:08:41.988 --> 00:08:43.923 line:95%,end
why isn't she teaching her daughter?

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:45.057 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I have no idea.

00:08:45.124 --> 00:08:48.194 line:95%,end
<i>I can tell she's a very positive, upbeat,</i>

00:08:48.261 --> 00:08:50.129 line:95%,end
-kind of a nice person.
-Ooh, boy.

00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:51.898 line:95%,end
And Abby is so the opposite.

00:08:51.964 --> 00:08:53.432 line:95%,end
Wait till she gets a load of this.

00:08:53.499 --> 00:08:54.634 line:95%,end
I already have to deal with Melissa

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:55.902 line:95%,end
being a perky, goody two shoes.

00:08:57.036 --> 00:08:57.970 line:95%,end
Oh, Jesus.

00:08:58.037 --> 00:09:00.740 line:95%,end
Now we have this new mom coming in
who's like snobby Poppins,

00:09:00.806 --> 00:09:02.642 line:95%,end
and she can be Melissa's perky bookend.

00:09:07.146 --> 00:09:08.381 line:5%,start
-MADDIE: <i>Seven?</i>
-MELISSA: <i>Here comes Abby.</i>

00:09:08.948 --> 00:09:10.716 line:95%,end
Go, go, go. Stretch.

00:09:11.183 --> 00:09:12.151 line:95%,end
Abby's coming.

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:13.586 line:95%,end
-Hey, guys.
-ALL: Hi.

00:09:13.653 --> 00:09:15.288 line:95%,end
ABBY: Is everybody here
for the "Electricity"

00:09:15.354 --> 00:09:16.188 line:95%,end
competition group?

00:09:16.255 --> 00:09:18.057 line:95%,end
-ALL: Yes.
-ABBY: Yes. Okay.

00:09:18.124 --> 00:09:20.860 line:95%,end
Moms, before we rehearse--
actually Sandy is here,

00:09:20.927 --> 00:09:22.161 line:95%,end
and she's gonna do a costume fitting,

00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:24.463 line:95%,end
so we can get this finished for today.

00:09:24.864 --> 00:09:26.098 line:95%,end
All right? Excited?

00:09:26.165 --> 00:09:26.999 line:95%,end
ALL: Yeah.

00:09:27.066 --> 00:09:28.067 line:95%,end
-Are they pretty?
-What color are they?

00:09:29.068 --> 00:09:30.269 line:95%,end
ALL: (gasps)

00:09:30.336 --> 00:09:31.504 line:95%,end
ABBY: Yeah, let's go.

00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:33.573 line:95%,end
HOLLY: <i>New costumes</i>
<i>are always really exciting.</i>

00:09:33.639 --> 00:09:34.941 line:95%,end
<i>You never know what we're gonna get,</i>

00:09:35.007 --> 00:09:37.276 line:5%,start
but I don't add up the bills
because it's too much money

00:09:37.343 --> 00:09:38.377 line:5%,start
to add up the bills and dance.

00:09:38.444 --> 00:09:39.645 line:5%,start
I think I'd pass out on the floor.

00:09:41.447 --> 00:09:42.381 line:5%,start
ABBY: All right.

00:09:42.448 --> 00:09:44.850 line:5%,start
Let me call the girls,
and I'll get them one at a time for you.

00:09:45.618 --> 00:09:46.619 line:95%,end
Nia?

00:09:46.919 --> 00:09:49.355 line:95%,end
(suspenseful music playing)

00:09:50.423 --> 00:09:52.725 line:95%,end
(laughs)

00:09:53.159 --> 00:09:54.894 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Where's the rest of her costume?


00:09:58.631 --> 00:09:59.899 line:5%,start
(upbeat music playing)

00:09:59.966 --> 00:10:00.900 line:5%,start
ABBY: Nia?

00:10:02.501 --> 00:10:04.604 line:95%,end
(laughs)

00:10:06.539 --> 00:10:08.407 line:5%,start
Where's the rest of her costume?

00:10:09.642 --> 00:10:10.476 line:95%,end
That's it.

00:10:11.177 --> 00:10:12.411 line:95%,end
We need to spice it up.

00:10:12.478 --> 00:10:14.146 line:95%,end
I guess we're going with skin to win?

00:10:14.213 --> 00:10:16.349 line:95%,end
ABBY: Yes, so French twist

00:10:16.415 --> 00:10:17.617 line:95%,end
with the curls on the top.

00:10:17.683 --> 00:10:19.185 line:95%,end
How are we wearing the socks?

00:10:19.652 --> 00:10:22.955 line:95%,end
ABBY: Two inches
above the knee, bare legs,

00:10:23.022 --> 00:10:26.192 line:95%,end
and use your double stick lingerie tape.

00:10:26.258 --> 00:10:28.561 line:95%,end
And we're give you the stones
when we're finished with the fittings,

00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:29.895 line:95%,end
and you can stoning them.

00:10:29.962 --> 00:10:31.497 line:95%,end
So you're good.

00:10:31.564 --> 00:10:33.532 line:95%,end
You want to send the next girl in, please?

00:10:33.599 --> 00:10:34.433 line:95%,end
Oh, Lord.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.669 line:95%,end
<i>We're headed to Lancaster, Pennsylvania</i>

00:10:36.736 --> 00:10:40.139 line:95%,end
<i>for a competition and home of Amish</i>
<i>buggies and bonnets.</i>

00:10:40.206 --> 00:10:42.875 line:5%,start
Our regular dance would cause
a few people out in Lancaster

00:10:42.942 --> 00:10:44.744 line:5%,start
to have a stroke, let alone these things.

00:10:45.745 --> 00:10:48.314 line:95%,end
Guys, we gotta wear stuff like this.

00:10:48.381 --> 00:10:50.416 line:95%,end
When we were in Phoenix last weekend,

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:52.451 line:95%,end
everybody had outfits on like this.

00:10:54.253 --> 00:10:58.424 line:95%,end
Oh, showing off your sexy little bod.

00:10:58.824 --> 00:11:01.594 line:95%,end
Just we want these on the side, I guess.

00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:02.962 line:95%,end
They look like little tarts.

00:11:03.029 --> 00:11:04.563 line:95%,end
They do not look like little girls.

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:06.832 line:95%,end
KELLY: They don't think of it
as their dancing in a bra.

00:11:06.899 --> 00:11:08.634 line:95%,end
-It's their costume.
-But you know what?

00:11:08.701 --> 00:11:10.036 line:95%,end
There are people in the audience
who see them,

00:11:10.102 --> 00:11:11.470 line:95%,end
and they think they're dancing in a bra.

00:11:11.537 --> 00:11:12.638 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: We've had costumes smaller.

00:11:12.705 --> 00:11:14.807 line:95%,end
It's that it looks sleazy.

00:11:14.874 --> 00:11:15.975 line:95%,end
HOLLY: I think it's too sexy.

00:11:16.042 --> 00:11:17.877 line:95%,end
I absolutely think it's too sexy.

00:11:17.943 --> 00:11:19.712 line:95%,end
You know what?
Can we not use the word sexy?

00:11:19.779 --> 00:11:21.080 line:95%,end
Can we just say skimpy?

00:11:21.147 --> 00:11:22.114 line:95%,end
HOLLY: You can say scandalous.

00:11:22.181 --> 00:11:23.315 line:95%,end
You can say sassy.

00:11:23.382 --> 00:11:25.785 line:95%,end
It is still too much for their age.

00:11:25.851 --> 00:11:28.487 line:95%,end
And she'll be with 800 other kids
that look the same way.

00:11:30.623 --> 00:11:34.493 line:95%,end
If you don't like what I'm doing,
go open your own studio.

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.862 line:95%,end
<i>These moms come to me</i>
<i>because of my credentials,</i>

00:11:36.929 --> 00:11:38.964 line:95%,end
and of course my success rate,

00:11:39.031 --> 00:11:41.100 line:95%,end
but then they wanna tell me
how to do my business.

00:11:41.167 --> 00:11:42.368 line:95%,end
Not gonna happen.

00:11:42.435 --> 00:11:43.569 line:95%,end
Chloe, let's go.

00:11:43.636 --> 00:11:45.404 line:95%,end
Oh, I can't look.

00:11:47.206 --> 00:11:48.174 line:95%,end
ABBY: Chloe, let me ask you,

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.275 line:95%,end
how do you feel about the costume?

00:11:52.011 --> 00:11:53.512 line:95%,end
You didn't know any better.

00:11:53.579 --> 00:11:55.147 line:95%,end
It's just embarrassing for our daughters

00:11:55.214 --> 00:11:56.782 line:95%,end
<i>to be up there dressed like that.</i>

00:11:56.849 --> 00:11:58.284 line:95%,end
They look like prosti-tots.

00:11:58.350 --> 00:11:59.752 line:95%,end
How would your dad feel
about that costume?

00:11:59.819 --> 00:12:00.653 line:95%,end
ABBY: You know what?

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.555 line:95%,end
Until he's here painting
and working and cleaning,

00:12:02.621 --> 00:12:03.456 line:95%,end
he doesn't get to say.

00:12:06.125 --> 00:12:08.728 line:95%,end
(dramatic music playing)

00:12:14.366 --> 00:12:15.935 line:95%,end
CATHY: <i>Abby only demands three things</i>

<i>if you want to be on her competition team,</i>

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:19.805 line:95%,end
<i>time, dedication, and money.</i>

<i>to Abby's school</i>

00:12:26.679 --> 00:12:31.183 line:95%,end
because she makes kids stars,
and I think she can make Vivi a star.

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:32.551 line:95%,end
Hey.

00:12:33.252 --> 00:12:34.687 line:95%,end
Sorry, I'm late. Are you all warmed up?

00:12:34.754 --> 00:12:36.822 line:95%,end
-Ready to go? Yes?
-Yes, we are. Yes, we are.

00:12:36.889 --> 00:12:39.425 line:95%,end
Okay, how about if
you go ahead over there.

00:12:39.492 --> 00:12:41.127 line:95%,end
-Okay.
-And you're gonna play my music.

00:12:41.193 --> 00:12:42.261 line:95%,end
Maybe you could grab a stool.

VIVI: My favorite thing to do

ABBY: PassÃ© that knee.

PassÃ©, no parallel.

00:12:51.737 --> 00:12:53.873 line:95%,end
Parallel, like in jazz class. PassÃ©.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.274 line:95%,end
Straight, honey.

00:12:55.341 --> 00:12:58.010 line:95%,end
ABBY: I get these kids in here
from other dance studios all the time,

00:12:58.444 --> 00:13:02.081 line:95%,end
and none of them
have been taught proper terminology,

00:13:02.148 --> 00:13:04.583 line:95%,end
<i>so instead of saying a grand jetÃ©,</i>

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:06.719 line:95%,end
they're like flying saucer leap.

00:13:06.786 --> 00:13:08.320 line:95%,end
And I'm like what is that?

00:13:08.988 --> 00:13:10.122 line:95%,end
That's such a joke.

00:13:10.189 --> 00:13:11.524 line:95%,end
That's where you wanna be in the air.

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:12.892 line:95%,end
That's what I wanna see.
Now get up and do it.

00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:13.959 line:95%,end
Let's go.

00:13:14.026 --> 00:13:15.561 line:95%,end
<i>Vivian needs a lot of work.</i>

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:18.798 line:95%,end
She really does, but I'm gonna go ahead

00:13:18.864 --> 00:13:22.001 line:95%,end
and let her compete this weekend
because I think it would be good for her.

00:13:22.067 --> 00:13:23.269 line:95%,end
KELLY: Melissa, is that the new girl?

00:13:23.335 --> 00:13:24.170 line:95%,end
Mm-hmm.

00:13:24.236 --> 00:13:26.038 line:95%,end
Does she come from a competition studio?

00:13:26.105 --> 00:13:27.640 line:95%,end
MELISSA: She said that
she was on a competition team, but--

00:13:27.706 --> 00:13:29.074 line:95%,end
-It doesn't look like it.
-MELISSA: Uh-uh.

00:13:29.141 --> 00:13:30.976 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>I've been able to work with Vivian</i>

00:13:31.043 --> 00:13:32.845 line:95%,end
a little more closely this week,

00:13:32.912 --> 00:13:36.182 line:95%,end
so I'm going to let her do
a little jazz duet with McKenzie.

00:13:36.682 --> 00:13:37.983 line:95%,end
(laughing)

00:13:38.951 --> 00:13:40.119 line:95%,end
Her mother has money.

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:47.393 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>I have a group of moms at my studio</i>

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:50.095 line:95%,end
<i>that have caused many students to leave.</i>

00:13:50.529 --> 00:13:52.932 line:95%,end
They sit upstairs
in the observation mezzanine

00:13:52.998 --> 00:13:55.167 line:95%,end
and degrade other people's children.

00:13:55.234 --> 00:13:56.068 line:95%,end
(laughs)

00:13:56.135 --> 00:13:57.837 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>Go get a job</i>
<i>and come back and pick your kid up</i>

00:13:57.903 --> 00:13:59.238 line:95%,end
at the end of the night.

00:13:59.305 --> 00:14:00.906 line:95%,end
Oh. Oh, my goodness.

00:14:00.973 --> 00:14:01.974 line:95%,end
She fell over.

00:14:02.041 --> 00:14:03.542 line:95%,end
(laughs)

00:14:04.076 --> 00:14:07.079 line:5%,start
(upbeat music playing)


00:14:16.789 --> 00:14:20.226 line:95%,end
MELISSA: <i>For StarQuest,</i>
<i>Abby has Vivi and McKenzie on a duet.</i>

00:14:20.292 --> 00:14:22.561 line:5%,start
I'm very surprised
that Abby is letting Vivi

00:14:22.628 --> 00:14:25.030 line:5%,start
on the competition team for this weekend.

00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:27.499 line:95%,end
Oh, she just stepped on my daughter.

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:29.768 line:95%,end
ABBY: Turn, two, three.

00:14:29.835 --> 00:14:30.669 line:95%,end
Other foot.

00:14:30.736 --> 00:14:34.039 line:95%,end
Now you go--boom--

00:14:34.106 --> 00:14:34.974 line:95%,end
to the right.

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.008 line:95%,end
What's the mom like?

00:14:36.308 --> 00:14:37.376 line:95%,end
MELISSA: She's very nice.

00:14:37.443 --> 00:14:38.377 line:95%,end
Very nice.

00:14:38.444 --> 00:14:40.379 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I'm just getting kind of hesitant

00:14:40.446 --> 00:14:41.313 line:95%,end
she's allowed in there.

00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:44.717 line:95%,end
KELLY: But she's allowed
because she's a dance teacher

00:14:44.783 --> 00:14:46.252 line:95%,end
and one of Abby's colleagues.

00:14:46.619 --> 00:14:49.922 line:95%,end
Okay. I think I've done enough
with the routine right now.

00:14:49.989 --> 00:14:51.657 line:95%,end
I'm gonna see what they can do together,

00:14:51.724 --> 00:14:52.958 line:95%,end
so I'm gonna to send you upstairs.

00:14:53.025 --> 00:14:53.993 line:95%,end
-Okay?
-Okay. Okay.

00:14:54.059 --> 00:14:54.927 line:95%,end
ABBY: Thank you.

00:14:55.527 --> 00:14:56.862 line:95%,end
All right, girls. Let's figure this out.

00:14:56.929 --> 00:14:58.564 line:95%,end
Go back. Hand to foot, foot.

00:14:59.231 --> 00:15:00.132 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Hold on, one more.

00:15:00.199 --> 00:15:01.634 line:95%,end
-Hi.
-Hi.

00:15:03.502 --> 00:15:05.137 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Girls, this is Cathy.

00:15:05.337 --> 00:15:06.171 line:95%,end
CATHY: Hi.

00:15:06.238 --> 00:15:07.206 line:95%,end
Hi, Cathy.

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:08.941 line:95%,end
You guys are rhinestoning, huh?

00:15:09.275 --> 00:15:10.342 line:95%,end
KELLY: For this weekend.

00:15:10.409 --> 00:15:11.310 line:95%,end
CATHY: Okay.

00:15:11.377 --> 00:15:13.445 line:95%,end
So somebody's gonna
rhinestone mine, right?

00:15:13.512 --> 00:15:14.546 line:95%,end
-No.
-(Cathy laughs)

00:15:14.613 --> 00:15:16.048 line:95%,end
You gotta rhinestone your own.

00:15:16.682 --> 00:15:18.717 line:95%,end
Oh. Well, what happens
if you don't know how to sew?

00:15:18.784 --> 00:15:19.685 line:95%,end
You need to learn.

00:15:19.752 --> 00:15:22.454 line:95%,end
CATHY: We have a seamstress
at our studio that does all this.

00:15:22.521 --> 00:15:23.722 line:95%,end
The moms don't do any of it.

00:15:23.789 --> 00:15:25.758 line:95%,end
We're way more organized
than you guys are.

00:15:28.527 --> 00:15:31.964 line:95%,end
I found it weird
that she owns a dance studio

00:15:32.031 --> 00:15:33.432 line:95%,end
and she's bringing her daughter

00:15:33.499 --> 00:15:35.701 line:95%,end
two hours away
to a different dance studio.

00:15:35.768 --> 00:15:39.071 line:95%,end
I mean, I would think that
you would make your dance studio

00:15:39.138 --> 00:15:40.806 line:95%,end
be good enough for your own child.

00:15:40.873 --> 00:15:42.775 line:95%,end
Why don't you

00:15:42.841 --> 00:15:44.276 line:95%,end
-take your daughter to your studio?
-CATHY: Go back to my studio.

00:15:45.577 --> 00:15:46.912 line:95%,end
Go back to my studio.

00:15:46.979 --> 00:15:48.681 line:95%,end
<i>I don't care what these moms think of me.</i>

00:15:48.747 --> 00:15:51.750 line:95%,end
All I care is that I get Vivi
where she needs to be

00:15:51.817 --> 00:15:53.018 line:95%,end
and that is to the top.

00:15:53.085 --> 00:15:55.020 line:5%,start
And do you guys use Swarovski crystals?

00:15:55.087 --> 00:15:56.588 line:5%,start
-ALL: Yes.
-CATHY: Yeah, so do we.

00:15:58.157 --> 00:16:00.993 line:5%,start
ABBY: <i>Watch--don't land</i>
<i>on that heel on that jetÃ©.</i>

00:16:03.095 --> 00:16:04.096 line:5%,start
Smile.

00:16:04.163 --> 00:16:06.532 line:5%,start
<i>This week Chloe and Maddie</i>
<i>both have new solos.</i>

00:16:06.598 --> 00:16:10.369 line:95%,end
Maddie will be doing
an emotional lyrical routine to "Cry,"

00:16:10.436 --> 00:16:13.105 line:95%,end
and Chloe will be doing
a musical theater number

00:16:13.172 --> 00:16:14.006 line:95%,end
to "Baby Mine."

00:16:14.573 --> 00:16:16.375 line:95%,end
Again, you're not landing a pliÃ©.

00:16:16.442 --> 00:16:17.276 line:95%,end
PliÃ©.

00:16:18.577 --> 00:16:24.383 line:5%,start
MADDIE: I dance seven days
a week from 4:00 to 10:00,

00:16:24.817 --> 00:16:29.254 line:5%,start
and we don't get home until like 11:45.

00:16:29.321 --> 00:16:31.457 line:95%,end
ABBY: Don't bounce in that split.

00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:32.725 line:95%,end
PliÃ©.

00:16:37.496 --> 00:16:39.698 line:95%,end
MADDIE: <i>Chloe is my biggest competitor.</i>

00:16:39.765 --> 00:16:41.734 line:95%,end
I think I'm a little bit better than her

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:45.404 line:95%,end
because I've won many awards than her.

00:16:49.308 --> 00:16:51.677 line:95%,end
My daughter's supposed to be
doing her solo this weekend?

00:16:52.311 --> 00:16:54.113 line:95%,end
Uh, why isn't she working with my kid?

00:16:54.179 --> 00:16:55.280 line:95%,end
Why is she in there doing this?

00:16:55.347 --> 00:16:57.249 line:95%,end
-Is this competing?
-'Cause her last name isn't Ziegler.

00:16:58.784 --> 00:17:01.286 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: Maddie's been in class
this week working on her solo,

00:17:01.353 --> 00:17:03.856 line:5%,start
and you know, it's perfected
and it's wonderful and perfect,

00:17:03.922 --> 00:17:06.258 line:5%,start
and then she's going to send
my daughter out on stage

00:17:06.325 --> 00:17:07.393 line:5%,start
<i>kind of looking like a fool.</i>

00:17:11.196 --> 00:17:12.498 line:5%,start
Through this part, wait.

00:17:12.564 --> 00:17:13.432 line:95%,end
Are you--

00:17:13.799 --> 00:17:15.234 line:95%,end
Chloe, get down.

00:17:15.501 --> 00:17:16.735 line:95%,end
You have to do it.

00:17:16.802 --> 00:17:18.170 line:95%,end
Okay. My foot hurts.

00:17:18.237 --> 00:17:19.471 line:95%,end
I know, Clo.

00:17:20.372 --> 00:17:24.243 line:5%,start
I often wonder if Abby gave Chloe
1/20 of the same attention

00:17:24.309 --> 00:17:26.812 line:5%,start
that she gave Maddie
what kind of dancer my daughter could be.

00:17:26.879 --> 00:17:28.714 line:95%,end
The only one giving her
attention really is me,

00:17:28.781 --> 00:17:30.349 line:95%,end
and I'm not a qualified dance teacher.

00:17:30.816 --> 00:17:32.384 line:95%,end
CHLOE: My hip really hurts.

00:17:32.918 --> 00:17:33.952 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: We don't have a choice.

00:17:34.019 --> 00:17:37.289 line:95%,end
This is all we have,
and we have to do it so go.

00:17:37.356 --> 00:17:38.457 line:95%,end
<i>It really upsets me.</i>

00:17:38.524 --> 00:17:39.725 line:95%,end
It's not just me it's hurting.

00:17:39.792 --> 00:17:40.692 line:95%,end
It's hurting my child,

00:17:40.759 --> 00:17:42.728 line:95%,end
and I'm the one
who keeps bringing my child back.

00:17:43.162 --> 00:17:44.430 line:95%,end
Pretty, smile.

00:17:45.431 --> 00:17:47.733 line:95%,end
<i>I wonder what it's doing</i>
<i>to her psyche to always</i>

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:51.236 line:95%,end
<i>be held down and not given</i>
<i>the same opportunities to excel.</i>

00:17:51.703 --> 00:17:53.505 line:95%,end
Smile.

00:17:54.406 --> 00:17:55.340 line:95%,end
That's fake.

00:17:59.344 --> 00:18:02.314 line:95%,end
Come on.
Let's do it one more time with the music.

00:18:02.381 --> 00:18:04.216 line:95%,end
SINGER: <i>âª And she's my baby âª</i>

00:18:04.283 --> 00:18:06.085 line:95%,end
Chloe, you can stretch your arms.

SINGER: <i>âª My favorite toy âª</i>

<i>Faster there.</i>

00:18:10.255 --> 00:18:11.090 line:95%,end
<i>Arch your back.</i>

00:18:11.156 --> 00:18:13.425 line:95%,end
SINGER:
<i>âª Talking about my sweet baby, ooh âª</i>


00:18:14.493 --> 00:18:16.428 line:5%,start
(dramatic music playing)

00:18:16.495 --> 00:18:19.865 line:5%,start
ABBY: Give me a hands out,
hands out, let him go.

00:18:21.266 --> 00:18:23.268 line:5%,start
Yes, so we're just adding two steps in.

00:18:23.335 --> 00:18:25.571 line:95%,end
CHRISTI:
<i>I pay Abby an exorbitant amount of money</i>

00:18:25.637 --> 00:18:28.173 line:95%,end
<i>so Chloe will get the same attention</i>
<i>that she gives Maddie</i>

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.075 line:95%,end
<i>because Maddie gets all</i>
<i>these extra classes,</i>

00:18:30.142 --> 00:18:32.077 line:95%,end
all this extra attention,
and Chloe gets none of that.

00:18:32.144 --> 00:18:34.379 line:5%,start
They say, oh, no. Everything's fair.
It's not fair.

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.215 line:95%,end
But I'm not gonna have
you treat me like this.

00:18:36.281 --> 00:18:38.283 line:95%,end
-I'm an adult.
-Act like one.

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:40.085 line:95%,end
Remember, I pay your bills.

00:18:40.152 --> 00:18:41.220 line:95%,end
You work for me.

00:18:43.889 --> 00:18:47.593 line:95%,end
Tomorrow is the competition,
and I have no doubt in my mind

00:18:47.659 --> 00:18:49.862 line:95%,end
that we are going to blow
this thing out of the water.

00:18:50.395 --> 00:18:52.364 line:95%,end
<i>Chloe is one of my strongest dancers.</i>

00:18:52.431 --> 00:18:53.966 line:95%,end
<i>She's really coming along nicely.</i>

00:18:54.032 --> 00:18:56.635 line:95%,end
There's a few technical issues
she needs to work on,

00:18:56.702 --> 00:18:59.171 line:95%,end
<i>but mainly applying corrections.</i>

00:18:59.238 --> 00:19:01.907 line:95%,end
She needs to apply corrections quickly
and then move on.

00:19:02.407 --> 00:19:07.546 line:5%,start
<i>And one, two, three, four, five, six.</i>

00:19:07.613 --> 00:19:09.648 line:95%,end
I brought costumes this day.

00:19:09.715 --> 00:19:11.950 line:95%,end
ABBY: Nia, is that an attitude turn?

00:19:12.751 --> 00:19:14.086 line:95%,end
You're out of the picture, Chloe.

00:19:14.153 --> 00:19:15.120 line:95%,end
Get in tighter.

This is Vivi.

Hi, Vivi.

CATHY: Yeah. Look, I don't stone.

00:19:30.235 --> 00:19:31.637 line:95%,end
I'm no stoner.

(apprehensive music playing)

00:19:35.874 --> 00:19:37.075 line:95%,end
I'm just gonna sit down.

00:19:37.142 --> 00:19:39.845 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: So Melissa,
what's there to do where we're going?

00:19:39.912 --> 00:19:41.847 line:95%,end
-Amish country.
-MELISSA: The outlets are right there.

00:19:41.914 --> 00:19:43.348 line:95%,end
-The shopping.
-Oh, there's an outlet?

00:19:43.415 --> 00:19:44.616 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Are you kidding me? They're huge.

00:19:44.683 --> 00:19:46.418 line:95%,end
What are you going to shop for
in Lancaster?

00:19:46.485 --> 00:19:47.686 line:95%,end
Well, Amish stuff.

00:19:48.153 --> 00:19:49.888 line:95%,end
-KELLY: You're gonna be changing costumes.
-Cheese.

00:19:49.955 --> 00:19:51.056 line:95%,end
KELLY: Or need somebody

00:19:51.123 --> 00:19:52.758 line:95%,end
-to change the costumes for you too?
-I have a changer.

00:19:52.824 --> 00:19:54.960 line:95%,end
-I'll have a changer with me.
-KELLY: Oh, God.

00:19:55.527 --> 00:19:57.029 line:5%,start
Step, relevÃ©.

00:19:57.095 --> 00:19:57.963 line:5%,start
Up.

00:19:59.097 --> 00:19:59.932 line:95%,end
Up.

00:20:00.332 --> 00:20:02.401 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Oh, my God.
I am so stressed out about everything

00:20:02.467 --> 00:20:03.569 line:95%,end
I need to do at home.

00:20:03.635 --> 00:20:05.304 line:95%,end
How do you guys get your housework done?

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:07.873 line:95%,end
I don't. Like I'm trying to make it home
before my husband

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:09.875 line:95%,end
because there's Cheerios
all over my kitchen,

00:20:09.942 --> 00:20:11.910 line:95%,end
and I have to sweep quick
before he comes home.

00:20:11.977 --> 00:20:15.013 line:95%,end
I have to vacuum,
and I need to fold all my laundry

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.048 line:95%,end
and pack for tomorrow.

00:20:16.114 --> 00:20:19.418 line:95%,end

<i>âª Baby, it's all... âª</i>

00:20:27.192 --> 00:20:28.527 line:95%,end
I didn't cook dinner for my kids.

00:20:28.594 --> 00:20:30.596 line:95%,end
Like my house is a mess.

00:20:30.662 --> 00:20:32.030 line:95%,end
I have laundry everywhere.

00:20:32.364 --> 00:20:33.198 line:95%,end
Ugh.

00:20:33.265 --> 00:20:35.200 line:95%,end
<i>The studio overtakes my life.</i>

00:20:35.767 --> 00:20:38.437 line:95%,end
<i>It's the night before a competition</i>

00:20:38.503 --> 00:20:40.372 line:95%,end
She's been going from 6:30 in the morning

00:20:40.439 --> 00:20:42.007 line:95%,end
until 9:30 at night.

00:20:44.109 --> 00:20:45.477 line:95%,end
It'll all get done.

00:20:45.844 --> 00:20:46.912 line:95%,end
When?

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:53.518 line:95%,end
This little baby's been out

00:20:53.585 --> 00:20:56.321 line:95%,end
since who knows
what time this morning, and...

00:20:58.123 --> 00:20:59.024 line:95%,end
No, she's not.

00:20:59.091 --> 00:21:01.059 line:95%,end
She needs to go home and eat dinner,

00:21:01.126 --> 00:21:04.296 line:95%,end
but not just that, I need to go home.


00:21:07.866 --> 00:21:10.235 line:95%,end
Abby, I need to know
what's going on with Chloe's dance

00:21:10.302 --> 00:21:12.471 line:95%,end
'cause we can't stay until 9:00 tonight.

00:21:12.537 --> 00:21:14.773 line:95%,end
I haven't been home
since 8:00 this morning.

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.174 line:95%,end
Matt needs her for tap.

00:21:16.241 --> 00:21:17.709 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: But, she's
gonna dance until 9:00.

00:21:17.776 --> 00:21:18.610 line:95%,end
She's a little girl.

00:21:18.677 --> 00:21:20.312 line:95%,end
Seven hours of dance is a lot.

00:21:20.379 --> 00:21:22.447 line:95%,end
ABBY: Then don't audition
for any Broadway shows

00:21:22.514 --> 00:21:23.849 line:95%,end
'cause you'll be working 12 hours a day.

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:27.519 line:95%,end
Christi's telling me
she's concerned about Chloe.

00:21:27.586 --> 00:21:29.187 line:95%,end
She's concerned about the new music

00:21:29.254 --> 00:21:30.722 line:95%,end
and her performance this weekend

00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:32.090 line:95%,end
<i>that she wants to leave early.</i>

00:21:32.157 --> 00:21:34.559 line:95%,end
And my older students that have gone on

00:21:34.626 --> 00:21:36.662 line:95%,end
to be Broadway professionals,

00:21:36.728 --> 00:21:38.930 line:95%,end
they would have stayed in
this room until midnight.

00:21:38.997 --> 00:21:41.967 line:95%,end
She can sleep tomorrow
on the bus for five hours.

00:21:43.068 --> 00:21:44.236 line:95%,end
What do you want to do?

00:21:44.303 --> 00:21:46.938 line:95%,end
I have to get to ready
for the morning tomorrow and...

00:21:47.005 --> 00:21:48.373 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: And you have a ton of homework.

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:50.242 line:95%,end
...a ton of homework
and I have to go to bed early.

00:21:51.009 --> 00:21:52.077 line:95%,end
You wanna leave, leave.

00:21:52.144 --> 00:21:55.147 line:95%,end
(sad music playing)

00:21:58.283 --> 00:21:59.351 line:95%,end
I know you're tired.

00:21:59.418 --> 00:22:01.153 line:95%,end
I know we were supposed
to come home early,

00:22:01.219 --> 00:22:02.921 line:95%,end
but you have to finish your solo.

00:22:03.522 --> 00:22:05.490 line:95%,end
But it's finished.
We just need to fix a part.

00:22:05.557 --> 00:22:07.759 line:95%,end
I know you do, but it's an hour.

00:22:07.826 --> 00:22:10.562 line:95%,end
And I can come back and get you, okay?

00:22:18.337 --> 00:22:20.038 line:95%,end
You know, Clo, I'm sorry.

00:22:20.472 --> 00:22:21.640 line:95%,end
If you wanna come home, you can,

00:22:21.707 --> 00:22:23.742 line:95%,end
but then we should probably
pull your solo.

00:22:24.376 --> 00:22:25.444 line:95%,end
Okay?

00:22:28.413 --> 00:22:30.916 line:95%,end
I know I promised you, and I'm so sorry.

00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:33.085 line:95%,end
<i>I wanted to be a dancer when I was a kid.</i>

00:22:33.151 --> 00:22:35.387 line:95%,end
<i>I was never given that opportunity.</i>

00:22:35.454 --> 00:22:38.390 line:95%,end
I had a really hard childhood,

00:22:38.457 --> 00:22:42.761 line:95%,end
and when I make decisions for my children,

00:22:42.828 --> 00:22:44.730 line:95%,end
I really just try to do it

00:22:44.796 --> 00:22:45.897 line:95%,end
based on...

00:22:47.032 --> 00:22:49.534 line:95%,end
what I think is best for my kids.

00:22:49.601 --> 00:22:50.836 line:95%,end
And unfortunately,

00:22:50.902 --> 00:22:53.705 line:95%,end
nobody did that for me
as a girl growing up,

00:22:53.772 --> 00:22:55.407 line:95%,end
and I really think it's important

00:22:55.474 --> 00:22:56.975 line:95%,end
that I do it for my girls.

00:22:57.776 --> 00:22:58.877 line:95%,end
Are you gonna be okay?

00:22:59.478 --> 00:23:00.545 line:95%,end
All right.

00:23:01.012 --> 00:23:03.048 line:95%,end
CHLOE: <i>I was trying</i>
<i>to stay strong for my mom</i>

00:23:03.115 --> 00:23:06.952 line:95%,end
'cause I didn't want to cry
and then make her even more upset.

00:23:07.419 --> 00:23:10.355 line:95%,end
Chloe, I don't know what all that's about,

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:13.458 line:95%,end
and all that hugging and all that crying

00:23:13.525 --> 00:23:15.861 line:95%,end
and all that carrying on, is ridiculous.

00:23:15.927 --> 00:23:16.828 line:95%,end
Who's in there?

00:23:17.662 --> 00:23:18.630 line:95%,end

00:23:22.267 --> 00:23:23.568 line:95%,end
You're an amazing dancer.

00:23:24.035 --> 00:23:26.071 line:95%,end
You're Junior Miss Dance of Pennsylvania.

00:23:26.138 --> 00:23:29.207 line:95%,end
Right now,
you should never be leaving early.

00:23:29.274 --> 00:23:30.409 line:95%,end
This is what's important.

00:23:30.475 --> 00:23:32.677 line:95%,end
This is your life right now, yes?

00:23:33.044 --> 00:23:34.880 line:95%,end
You need to be in tap in two minutes.

00:23:34.946 --> 00:23:35.847 line:95%,end
Go.

00:23:36.548 --> 00:23:38.717 line:95%,end
CHLOE: <i>I feel like</i>

00:23:46.258 --> 00:23:49.094 line:95%,end

This down. Let's go stand over here.
Come on.

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:04.176 line:5%,start
Today we're leaving
for StarQuest in Lancaster.

<i>This is gonna be very conservative.</i>

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:07.813 line:95%,end
<i>I feel that the costumes</i>
<i>are gonna be very low key</i>

00:24:07.879 --> 00:24:09.047 line:95%,end
<i>and the dances as well.</i>

00:24:09.114 --> 00:24:10.682 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>The other girls</i>

<i>going to be wearing, you know,</i>
<i>gowns from head to toe,</i>

00:24:12.751 --> 00:24:14.553 line:5%,start

Oh, check out her hair.

Yes, you have everything?

-Costumes? Shoes.
-Nope, we left those at home.

Even though I love
the dance "Electricity,"

00:24:26.665 --> 00:24:28.433 line:5%,start

00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:34.039 line:95%,end

I'm sitting up here.

Oh, my God. My abs are broke.

00:24:37.876 --> 00:24:39.911 line:95%,end
This is all the room that we have?

How come you this way?

Why didn't you go down (indistinct)

right on to the Parkway?

Oh, my God.

Now she's telling the bus driver
how to drive.

Abby's always yelling at the bus driver

'cause we always get there.

00:25:07.839 --> 00:25:09.708 line:95%,end
On the Parkway,
it would have been a straight shot

00:25:09.774 --> 00:25:10.909 line:95%,end
and a lot faster.

00:25:11.743 --> 00:25:13.044 line:95%,end
I'm bus sick already.

-No.

Maybe you should sit in the front.

Clo, can you come up here

eye makeup back here.

Steady on the road.

Girls.

This week the girls
really need to bring it.

00:33:59.837 --> 00:34:02.774 line:95%,end
They need to hit every turn,
they need to look older,

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:04.242 line:95%,end
they need to look sophisticated,

00:34:04.308 --> 00:34:06.444 line:95%,end

HOLLY: <i>I think the whole makeup,</i>

00:34:10.681 --> 00:34:13.484 line:95%,end

<i>will definitely lend itself</i>

00:34:13.551 --> 00:34:15.686 line:95%,end

I want them to go out
and be confident,

00:34:28.099 --> 00:34:29.867 line:95%,end

what mixed messages

00:34:29.934 --> 00:34:31.669 line:95%,end
we're sending to a bunch of little girls.

00:34:31.736 --> 00:34:33.771 line:95%,end
I mean, they really just don't get

00:34:33.838 --> 00:34:35.807 line:95%,end
because they're doing
what they're told to do,

00:34:35.873 --> 00:34:38.142 line:95%,end
but then you stand there as an adult

00:34:38.209 --> 00:34:42.180 line:95%,end

in the lobby like rubber neck

00:34:42.246 --> 00:34:44.248 line:95%,end

Abby, I know I respect your creativity

inappropriate for little girls.

00:39:31.902 --> 00:39:35.406 line:95%,end
I think you and I both know
that left me very uncomfortable

When--when they went down
and opened their legs,

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:44.615 line:95%,end
I almost walked out of there.
I mean, that's--

00:39:46.384 --> 00:39:49.553 line:95%,end
And you know what's so weird,
is your child loved it

00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:51.188 line:95%,end
-and wanted to do it.
-Yeah, I know

00:39:51.255 --> 00:39:53.657 line:95%,end
but our job as her mentors

00:39:53.724 --> 00:39:55.459 line:95%,end
is to protect them, not encourage that.

00:39:55.526 --> 00:39:56.627 line:95%,end
Exactly.

00:39:56.694 --> 00:39:57.661 line:95%,end
It really is.

Yes, and go ask your nine--excuse me.

00:40:10.274 --> 00:40:13.477 line:95%,end
Go ask your nine-year-old
if she likes what she's wearing.

what our kids think.

It's our responsibility as their parents.

Is to protect them.
People are looking at us.

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:21.152 line:95%,end
They are judging us.

00:40:21.218 --> 00:40:22.453 line:95%,end
Like, who knows
what they would wear because--

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:23.487 line:95%,end
They're judging you?

00:40:23.554 --> 00:40:25.389 line:95%,end
Absolutely. I'm the mother.

00:40:25.456 --> 00:40:26.991 line:95%,end
I let her go on stage like that.

00:40:27.057 --> 00:40:28.893 line:95%,end
Well then maybe
you should not come.

00:40:28.959 --> 00:40:30.227 line:95%,end
-CHRISTI: Okay.
-You need to stay at home,

00:40:30.294 --> 00:40:31.729 line:95%,end
and your daughter should come.

00:40:31.796 --> 00:40:32.763 line:95%,end
-Yes.
-Absolutely not.

00:40:32.830 --> 00:40:33.664 line:95%,end
-CHRISTI: Absolutely not.
-Absolutely.

00:40:33.731 --> 00:40:35.666 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>Abby's like the Queen of Hearts,</i>
<i>off with their heads.</i>

00:40:35.733 --> 00:40:37.001 line:95%,end
Like, she's never reasonable.

00:40:37.067 --> 00:40:38.169 line:95%,end
She never can understand

00:40:38.235 --> 00:40:39.637 line:95%,end
and listen to somebody else's
point of view.

00:40:39.703 --> 00:40:42.006 line:95%,end
It's always like done.

00:40:42.072 --> 00:40:43.541 line:95%,end
I'm a mom, I'm emotional,

00:40:43.607 --> 00:40:44.875 line:95%,end
and I cannot stand to see
my child like this.

00:40:44.942 --> 00:40:46.110 line:95%,end
-Okay, let me ask--
-It's too over the top,

00:40:46.177 --> 00:40:48.179 line:95%,end
and I need to go right now, Abby,
because I'm just a little traumatized.

00:40:48.245 --> 00:40:50.247 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>Christi and Holly</i>
<i>verbally assaulted me.</i>

00:40:50.314 --> 00:40:53.517 line:95%,end
When a parent opens their mouth,
they are ruining their child,

00:40:53.584 --> 00:40:54.952 line:95%,end
and that's what they need
to think about.

00:40:55.019 --> 00:40:57.121 line:95%,end
<i>Everyone is replaceable.</i>

00:40:57.188 --> 00:40:59.557 line:95%,end
<i>That's the first thing</i>
<i>you learn in my studio,</i>

00:40:59.623 --> 00:41:02.693 line:95%,end
and that is the last time
it will ever happen.

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:04.028 line:95%,end
It should not have happened.

00:41:04.094 --> 00:41:06.297 line:95%,end
<i>Chloe absolutely loves the costume,</i>

00:41:06.363 --> 00:41:08.732 line:95%,end
<i>loves what she's doing,</i>
<i>is a very talented little girl,</i>

00:41:08.799 --> 00:41:10.534 line:95%,end
but her mother's going to ruin her.

00:41:10.601 --> 00:41:12.102 line:95%,end
<i>It's obvious.</i>

00:41:12.169 --> 00:41:13.304 line:95%,end
