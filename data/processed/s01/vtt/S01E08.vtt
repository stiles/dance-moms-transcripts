ABBY: We are going to--

00:00:04.971 --> 00:00:06.239 line:5%,start
GIRLS: Starpower!

00:00:06.306 --> 00:00:08.808 line:5%,start
Maddie, you have one number
to dance and that's it.

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:10.610 line:5%,start
You're going to deal with it.
Be a grownup.

00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:13.713 line:5%,start
ABBY: <i>Nia missed a big glissade.</i>

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.983 line:5%,start
<i>I corrected her over and over,</i>
<i>and she still did it wrong.</i>

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:20.186 line:5%,start
I want her in Afro.

00:00:20.253 --> 00:00:21.321 line:5%,start
Do you have one?

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:22.822 line:5%,start
HOLLY: <i>Oh, just like</i>
<i>she's the token Black kid.</i>

00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:23.757 line:5%,start
ABBY: I did not say that.

00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:26.226 line:5%,start
But for $250 bucks a month,
go somewhere else.

00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:28.128 line:5%,start
Think closely about your words.

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:30.063 line:5%,start
ABBY: <i>Coming up on </i>Dance Moms--

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.333 line:5%,start
<i>Well, here we are at Starpower in Orlando.</i>

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.701 line:5%,start
Where's Cathy?

00:00:34.768 --> 00:00:35.969 line:5%,start
Where's Vivi-Anne?

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:37.904 line:5%,start
We're--we're getting off the party train.

00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:39.039 line:5%,start
Well, you're a quitter.

00:00:41.307 --> 00:00:42.642 line:5%,start
WOMAN: Hi!

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:45.311 line:5%,start
We heard so much about you.

00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:46.446 line:5%,start
Good luck.

ABBY: <i>This week</i>

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.469 line:5%,start
We have a long road
before we get to nationals.

00:01:09.536 --> 00:01:10.670 line:95%,end
Careful.

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:13.573 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>Here we are,</i>
<i>at Starpower in Orlando.</i>

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.575 line:95%,end
It's, like, their toughest competition.

00:01:15.642 --> 00:01:18.311 line:95%,end
These people do not mess around.

00:01:18.378 --> 00:01:20.914 line:95%,end
I'm so glad to be at a dance studio.
You have no idea.

00:01:22.148 --> 00:01:23.149 line:95%,end
Girls, let's go!

00:01:23.216 --> 00:01:24.884 line:95%,end
Come on!

00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:27.754 line:95%,end
All right. Where's Cathy?

00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:28.755 line:95%,end
Where's Vivi-Anne?

00:01:28.822 --> 00:01:29.722 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Don't know.

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:30.790 line:95%,end
The first thing I noticed,

00:01:30.857 --> 00:01:33.793 line:95%,end
no Cathy, No Vivi-Anne, no show.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.396 line:95%,end
Right now I am at the end
of my rope with Cathy.

00:01:36.463 --> 00:01:38.264 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>It doesn't surprise me</i>
<i>at all that Cathy's not here</i>

00:01:38.331 --> 00:01:39.165 line:95%,end
<i>for assignments.</i>

00:01:39.232 --> 00:01:42.168 line:5%,start
You know, she picks and chooses
what she wants to come to.

00:01:42.235 --> 00:01:45.705 line:95%,end
ABBY: Mackenzie, now, you and Vivi-Anne

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:48.608 line:95%,end
are supposed to have a duet, but no Vivi.

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:51.845 line:95%,end
So you might be doing
"Summer" by yourself.

00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:55.715 line:95%,end
Chloe, you're going to take a week off.

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:57.884 line:95%,end
I'm not going to do a new solo for you.

00:01:58.751 --> 00:02:00.720 line:95%,end
I think you need to work
on your technique.

00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:02.589 line:95%,end
CHLOE: <i>I would have been okay</i>
<i>if Miss Abby would have picked</i>

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:05.191 line:95%,end
<i>another week for me</i>
<i>to work on technical stuff.</i>

00:02:05.258 --> 00:02:08.361 line:5%,start
But I don't think it was really that fair,
because I was the only one.

00:02:08.428 --> 00:02:10.997 line:95%,end
And this was, like, kind of a big week.

00:02:11.064 --> 00:02:12.999 line:95%,end
I was happy with fourth place.

00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:14.534 line:95%,end
Your mother was not.

00:02:15.735 --> 00:02:17.137 line:95%,end
And I don't think you were, either.

00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:18.404 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>I'm shocked</i>
<i>that Chloe's on the bottom.</i>

00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:19.739 line:95%,end
<i>I thought Chloe was fabulous.</i>

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:22.008 line:5%,start
Abby needs to remember
that she has a problem with me,

00:02:22.075 --> 00:02:23.676 line:5%,start
she needs to take it up with me and not

00:02:23.743 --> 00:02:25.078 line:95%,end
punish my nine-year-old.

00:02:25.778 --> 00:02:26.880 line:95%,end
ABBY: Nia--

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:30.517 line:5%,start
HOLLY: After Nia performed
"Laquifa" in Connecticut,

00:02:30.583 --> 00:02:33.319 line:5%,start
I am not surprised at all
that she's in the bottom row.

00:02:33.386 --> 00:02:35.822 line:95%,end
<i>Actually, I think it's a good thing</i>
<i>that the judges did not find</i>

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:37.924 line:95%,end
<i>"Laquifa" to be exceptional.</i>

00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:39.926 line:95%,end
I think kudos to them.

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:41.661 line:95%,end
I was happy with you.

00:02:41.728 --> 00:02:44.030 line:95%,end
Your mother is not happy
with the choreography,

00:02:44.097 --> 00:02:45.565 line:95%,end
so we're going to work on that.

00:02:45.632 --> 00:02:49.369 line:95%,end
Mom, I don't want any more
altercations like Connecticut.

00:02:49.903 --> 00:02:50.937 line:95%,end
It was a conversation.

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:53.706 line:95%,end
I don't want any more conversations
like Connecticut.

00:02:53.773 --> 00:02:55.875 line:95%,end
HOLLY: <i>An altercation--</i>
<i>I think of it as being</i>

00:02:55.942 --> 00:02:58.411 line:95%,end
something that's really threatening.

00:02:58.478 --> 00:03:00.713 line:95%,end
And my conversation, just calling her

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.984 line:95%,end
on issues of accountability,
is not anything of an altercation.

00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:06.619 line:95%,end
It's a conversation.

00:03:07.086 --> 00:03:08.922 line:95%,end
ABBY: Maddie, you won.

00:03:08.988 --> 00:03:09.889 line:95%,end
It was great.

00:03:09.956 --> 00:03:11.424 line:95%,end
Costume was gorgeous.

00:03:11.491 --> 00:03:13.059 line:95%,end
Everything clicked.

00:03:13.126 --> 00:03:14.994 line:95%,end
I just don't want to see tears.

00:03:15.061 --> 00:03:16.496 line:95%,end
You're at the top of the age scale.

00:03:16.563 --> 00:03:17.830 line:95%,end
You did a beautiful job.

00:03:17.897 --> 00:03:19.766 line:95%,end
You did the title. This is your year.

00:03:19.832 --> 00:03:21.501 line:95%,end
<i>Maddie has been on this winning streak,</i>

00:03:21.568 --> 00:03:23.736 line:95%,end
and she just wins everywhere we go.

00:03:23.803 --> 00:03:27.140 line:95%,end
So, hopefully, she can
repeat her performance

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:29.442 line:95%,end
from Connecticut
and win another title here.

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:32.412 line:95%,end
Let's talk about the group number
for this week's competition.

00:03:32.478 --> 00:03:34.581 line:95%,end
The number is called "Snapshot."

00:03:34.647 --> 00:03:35.915 line:95%,end
You're all models.

00:03:35.982 --> 00:03:37.517 line:95%,end
So who's modeled before?

00:03:37.584 --> 00:03:39.319 line:95%,end
You've all modeled. Perfect.

00:03:39.385 --> 00:03:41.387 line:95%,end
So, now, you know what the runway is.

00:03:41.454 --> 00:03:43.756 line:95%,end
What else is at a fashion show?

00:03:43.823 --> 00:03:45.525 line:95%,end
A photographer.

00:03:45.592 --> 00:03:48.094 line:95%,end
I've got a lot to think
about over the last 24 hours,

00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:50.797 line:95%,end
and I think we need to bring
a boy in to be the photographer.


00:03:51.464 --> 00:03:52.665 line:95%,end
-What do you think?
-Brooke?

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:53.967 line:95%,end
WOMAN: Yes.

00:03:54.033 --> 00:03:56.069 line:95%,end
(laughs)

00:03:56.135 --> 00:03:59.472 line:95%,end
ABBY: I have a surprise
for all of you, a big surprise.

00:04:00.573 --> 00:04:01.708 line:95%,end
(suspenseful music playing)

00:04:01.774 --> 00:04:03.643 line:95%,end
Here's our photographer.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.578 line:95%,end
(suspenseful music playing)

00:04:09.616 --> 00:04:10.650 line:95%,end
It's Brandon!

00:04:11.851 --> 00:04:13.386 line:95%,end
NIA: He looks so weird!

00:04:13.453 --> 00:04:14.587 line:95%,end
(laughter)

00:04:14.654 --> 00:04:17.423 line:5%,start
BROOKE: Brandon and I used to like
each other a couple of years ago,

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.125 line:5%,start
but it never really went anywhere.

00:04:19.192 --> 00:04:20.393 line:95%,end
Is he here?

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:22.228 line:95%,end
Brandon!

00:04:22.295 --> 00:04:23.363 line:95%,end
DANCE MOM: No!

00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:24.731 line:95%,end
ABBY: Diane?

00:04:24.797 --> 00:04:25.832 line:95%,end
(cheering)

00:04:29.535 --> 00:04:32.138 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>I brought Brandon in</i>
<i>because he's a good looking guy.</i>

00:04:32.205 --> 00:04:35.008 line:95%,end
He's very masculine on stage,
which all of my boys are.

00:04:35.074 --> 00:04:36.743 line:95%,end
I pride myself on that.

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:38.578 line:95%,end
And he's getting to the point where

00:04:38.645 --> 00:04:41.214 line:95%,end
he's old enough and strong
enough to do overhead lifts.

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:42.715 line:95%,end
GIRL: Hi, Diane.

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:43.783 line:95%,end
Come stand in the line.

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:44.951 line:95%,end
<i>My name is Diane.</i>

00:04:45.018 --> 00:04:47.920 line:5%,start
Brandon has been one
of Abby's best answers for years.

00:04:47.987 --> 00:04:50.456 line:95%,end
<i>Abby told me she needed a boy</i>
<i>to spice up one of her numbers,</i>

00:04:50.523 --> 00:04:51.624 line:95%,end
and that's why we're here.

00:04:51.691 --> 00:04:53.226 line:95%,end
(indistinct chatter)

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:56.129 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>Brandon and Brooke</i>
<i>got paired up as duet partners.</i>

00:04:56.195 --> 00:04:58.431 line:95%,end
They used to do great together,
and then they started

00:04:58.498 --> 00:05:00.466 line:95%,end
liking each other and dating.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.803 line:95%,end
<i>Once they started dating,</i>
<i>they lost that connection</i>

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:04.837 line:95%,end
<i>in their dancing.</i>

00:05:04.904 --> 00:05:07.407 line:95%,end
Because I think they were, like,
embarrassed of each other.

00:05:07.473 --> 00:05:09.409 line:95%,end
Brooke, Brandon, you used to have a duet.

00:05:09.475 --> 00:05:11.477 line:95%,end
(laughter)

00:05:13.012 --> 00:05:16.082 line:95%,end
Well, guess what? You're going to be
doing some partner work.

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:18.718 line:95%,end
Brandon, you're not used
to this pace that we've been on.

00:05:18.785 --> 00:05:21.954 line:95%,end
You have four days
to pull this number together.

00:05:22.021 --> 00:05:23.356 line:95%,end
It's not about laying in the sun.

00:05:23.423 --> 00:05:25.124 line:95%,end
It's not about riding a ride.

00:05:25.191 --> 00:05:26.559 line:95%,end
It's about the dancing.

00:05:26.626 --> 00:05:29.662 line:95%,end
Everybody, five minutes to warm up
and then choreography.

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:30.797 line:95%,end
Let's go.

00:05:30.863 --> 00:05:32.765 line:95%,end
(camera shutter clicking)

00:05:32.832 --> 00:05:34.534 line:5%,start
SINGER: <i>âª Shiny lipgloss photo shoot âª</i>

<i>âª Dress me up in peek-a-boo âª</i>

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:37.537 line:5%,start
ABBY: Chin up high when you face upstage.

00:05:39.405 --> 00:05:41.107 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Welcome to our world.

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:43.176 line:95%,end
And home away from home.

00:05:43.242 --> 00:05:44.410 line:95%,end
Oh, God.

00:05:44.477 --> 00:05:47.513 line:95%,end
I cannot believe we're in Orlando
and I'm sitting in a...

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.148 line:95%,end
-I know.
-...damn dance studio.

00:05:50.416 --> 00:05:53.753 line:95%,end
ABBY: I'd rather her do a tumble
flat grand jetÃ© instead of the trick.

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:56.189 line:95%,end
<i>"Snapshot" is our number.</i>

00:05:56.255 --> 00:05:58.825 line:95%,end
<i>It's about models and a photographer,</i>

00:05:58.891 --> 00:06:02.128 line:95%,end
and the relationship grows from there.

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:04.430 line:95%,end
<i>I felt that the chemistry</i>
<i>between Brooke and Brandon</i>

00:06:04.497 --> 00:06:05.398 line:95%,end
<i>would be good.</i>

00:06:05.465 --> 00:06:07.767 line:95%,end
I think they used to have
a little fling at the studio.

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:11.971 line:95%,end
All right, Holly,
it wasn't an altercation.

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:13.005 line:95%,end
It was a conversation.

00:06:13.072 --> 00:06:14.841 line:95%,end
-Oh, you're too funny.
-It wasn't.

00:06:14.907 --> 00:06:17.443 line:95%,end
I'm just sick and tired of her
always making something

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.445 line:95%,end
more dramatic than what it is.

00:06:19.512 --> 00:06:20.480 line:95%,end
It was a conversation.

00:06:20.546 --> 00:06:22.281 line:95%,end
I'm not a person that has
altercations with people.

CHRISTI: Wait. I got to tell you--

00:06:24.517 --> 00:06:26.419 line:95%,end
ABBY: Pointing foot's turned in, Nia.

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:32.091 line:95%,end
Stay on that outside, Brooke.

00:06:32.158 --> 00:06:35.061 line:95%,end
Chloe, when you arch back,
square your shoulders off even.

00:06:35.128 --> 00:06:38.097 line:95%,end
And then she's making Chloe feel bad
like, oh, no solo for you this week.

00:06:38.164 --> 00:06:39.599 line:95%,end
We have to work on your technique.

00:06:39.665 --> 00:06:41.934 line:95%,end
I was happy with fourth place,
but your mother wasn't.

00:06:42.001 --> 00:06:43.469 line:95%,end
-HOLLY: I know.
-I never said that.

00:06:45.171 --> 00:06:46.172 line:95%,end
I can't stand it.

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:47.073 line:95%,end
I can't stand it.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:48.608 line:95%,end
DIANE: <i>I'm sitting around with these moms</i>

00:06:48.674 --> 00:06:50.476 line:95%,end
and I'm thinking, what the hell
did I get myself into.

00:06:50.543 --> 00:06:52.412 line:95%,end
The surest way that you will be
at the bottom of the pyramid

00:06:52.478 --> 00:06:53.746 line:95%,end
is if you speak up for anything
about your child.

00:06:53.813 --> 00:06:55.581 line:95%,end
-CHRISTI: Yeah.
-HOLLY: You will go to the bottom.

00:06:55.648 --> 00:06:57.283 line:95%,end
Like, Chloe didn't deserve to be
at the bottom of the pyramid.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:58.951 line:95%,end
MELISSA: No, not at all.

00:06:59.018 --> 00:07:00.787 line:95%,end
-GIANNA: In a line. In a line. In a line.
-It's ahead, straight ahead.

00:07:00.853 --> 00:07:02.555 line:95%,end
ABBY: That was nothing. That was silly.

00:07:02.622 --> 00:07:04.023 line:95%,end
PassÃ©, get that leg up.

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:05.725 line:95%,end
Sloppy arms.

00:07:05.792 --> 00:07:08.261 line:95%,end
You two aren't even looking
at each other. Come on!

00:07:08.327 --> 00:07:10.096 line:95%,end
-DIANE: I wonder if she's nice.
-They better connect.

00:07:10.163 --> 00:07:12.932 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>Brooke and Brandon are acting</i>
<i>really weird during the group number,</i>

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:14.400 line:95%,end
<i>doing their partnering.</i>

00:07:14.467 --> 00:07:16.936 line:95%,end
I think, personally, that they
both still like each other.

00:07:17.003 --> 00:07:18.471 line:95%,end
That's why they're acting that way.

00:07:18.538 --> 00:07:20.940 line:95%,end
Brandon, when I say the word
I want chemistry between you,

00:07:21.007 --> 00:07:22.208 line:95%,end
what does that mean?

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:23.643 line:95%,end
I mean, you have to have, like,

00:07:23.709 --> 00:07:26.279 line:95%,end
emotion between each other
and just the passion

00:07:26.345 --> 00:07:28.114 line:95%,end
that you would feel something.

00:07:28.181 --> 00:07:30.316 line:95%,end
Right. Like, this girl
makes your heart stop.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:31.984 line:95%,end
Yes.

00:07:32.051 --> 00:07:33.085 line:95%,end
What does it mean to you?

00:07:33.653 --> 00:07:34.587 line:95%,end
Same thing.

00:07:34.654 --> 00:07:36.222 line:95%,end
(laughs)

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:38.724 line:95%,end
She's talking about Brandon
and Brooke having the chemistry.

00:07:38.791 --> 00:07:40.560 line:95%,end
I don't know if you have
that much chemistry.


00:07:40.626 --> 00:07:41.461 line:95%,end
No.

00:07:41.527 --> 00:07:43.729 line:95%,end
ABBY: And how are we going
to get that in four days?

00:07:43.796 --> 00:07:44.730 line:95%,end
You're getting older.

00:07:44.797 --> 00:07:47.200 line:95%,end
You need to step up to the plate
and bring the performance.

00:07:47.266 --> 00:07:49.068 line:95%,end
DIANE: She's said you're getting older,
step up to the plate.

00:07:49.135 --> 00:07:52.772 line:95%,end
Well, 13 isn't old enough
to have that kind of chemistry.

00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:55.007 line:95%,end
Now do the arch back.

00:07:56.843 --> 00:08:01.247 line:95%,end
And look back at him,
and slide slowly down.

00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:02.482 line:95%,end
Ooh, lovely.

00:08:02.548 --> 00:08:04.684 line:95%,end
(laughs) I think some
of the moves in "Snapshot"

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:06.352 line:95%,end
were a little risque.

00:08:06.419 --> 00:08:08.721 line:95%,end
I mean, I felt like I was
watching <i>Dirty Dancing.</i>

00:08:08.788 --> 00:08:10.790 line:95%,end
Both of you need to use
your stomachs and engage.

00:08:10.857 --> 00:08:11.691 line:95%,end
Go.

00:08:11.757 --> 00:08:13.626 line:95%,end
<i>Watching Brooke and Brandon in rehearsal</i>

00:08:13.693 --> 00:08:15.695 line:95%,end

00:08:15.761 --> 00:08:16.796 line:95%,end
<i>Chaine out.</i>

00:08:16.863 --> 00:08:19.031 line:95%,end
There's nothing happening, nothing.

00:08:19.098 --> 00:08:20.967 line:95%,end
Kelly, Diane, come down here for a minute.

00:08:21.033 --> 00:08:22.235 line:95%,end
I need to talk to you.

00:08:22.301 --> 00:08:23.536 line:95%,end
DANCE MOM: Ha, ha!

00:08:24.136 --> 00:08:25.638 line:95%,end

00:08:25.705 --> 00:08:28.140 line:95%,end
Brooke, Brandon, come on over here.

00:08:28.207 --> 00:08:29.342 line:95%,end
Kelly, Diane!

00:08:29.408 --> 00:08:30.643 line:95%,end

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:31.544 line:95%,end
Come on down!

DANCE MOM: We have to walk there.

00:08:33.045 --> 00:08:37.783 line:95%,end
ABBY: Brooke, you and Brandon
are carrying this number.

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.452 line:95%,end
So I need chemistry.

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:40.720 line:95%,end
I need something.

00:08:41.454 --> 00:08:44.490 line:95%,end
And, if you two wouldn't mind,
I'm gonna send 'em on a date.

00:08:45.024 --> 00:08:46.225 line:95%,end
Oh.

00:08:46.292 --> 00:08:47.260 line:95%,end
(laughs)

00:08:48.127 --> 00:08:49.896 line:95%,end
But you two need to butt out of it.

00:08:49.962 --> 00:08:51.531 line:95%,end
Don't get a table for four.

00:08:51.597 --> 00:08:53.966 line:95%,end
Get a table for two
and another table for two you.

00:08:54.033 --> 00:08:55.368 line:95%,end
You let them do their own thing.

00:08:55.434 --> 00:08:57.703 line:95%,end
BROOKE: Brandon and I
never even really dated.

00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:02.074 line:95%,end
We just liked each other
and hung out all the time.

00:09:02.141 --> 00:09:04.243 line:95%,end
I've never even really been
on a real date before.

ABBY: Holly, come on down!
I told you I wanted you

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:13.819 line:95%,end
to come in on the private.

00:09:13.886 --> 00:09:14.954 line:95%,end
Here I am.

00:09:15.021 --> 00:09:16.956 line:95%,end
ABBY: Come on in. Have a seat right here.

HOLLY: After I requested that
dance be put into the routine,

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.028 line:95%,end
Abby made it very clear that I had

00:09:22.094 --> 00:09:24.330 line:95%,end
to be a part of that rehearsal.

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:25.831 line:95%,end
ABBY: Do it again.

00:09:25.898 --> 00:09:27.133 line:95%,end
Soutenu.

00:09:27.199 --> 00:09:28.267 line:95%,end
Don't--don't rush.

00:09:28.334 --> 00:09:29.602 line:95%,end
PliÃ©. Use your stomach.

00:09:29.669 --> 00:09:31.637 line:95%,end
Do you see how she bobbles
all over the place?

00:09:31.704 --> 00:09:33.773 line:95%,end
She doesn't engage her abdominals.

00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:36.008 line:95%,end
I made Holly come in
and watch the rehearsal,

00:09:36.475 --> 00:09:39.779 line:95%,end
because she does not have a clue

00:09:39.845 --> 00:09:43.783 line:95%,end
that that kid cannot correct herself.

00:09:43.849 --> 00:09:46.218 line:95%,end
Got it? You're on, kid.

00:10:03.169 --> 00:10:05.838 line:95%,end
I'm not sure, however,
that I would have picked

00:10:05.905 --> 00:10:07.506 line:95%,end
another ethnic dance for Nia.

00:10:07.573 --> 00:10:09.875 line:95%,end
This leg has to be over your head.

00:10:09.942 --> 00:10:11.143 line:95%,end
Stretch this foot.

00:10:12.111 --> 00:10:13.779 line:95%,end
Ooh, stretch it.

<i>I think she's setting Nia up</i>
<i>for failure, to be quite honest,</i>

00:10:19.352 --> 00:10:20.419 line:95%,end
I demanded it.

00:10:20.486 --> 00:10:21.621 line:95%,end
Go!

00:10:21.687 --> 00:10:23.990 line:95%,end
HOLLY: <i>And Abby's going</i>
<i>to give it back to me tenfold,</i>

00:10:24.056 --> 00:10:26.459 line:95%,end
<i>by putting Nia in a situation</i>

00:10:26.525 --> 00:10:30.129 line:95%,end
where she is almost
at the impossible level

00:10:30.196 --> 00:10:32.465 line:95%,end

a dance of that magnitude.

00:12:44.396 --> 00:12:45.698 line:95%,end
That looks fun.

00:12:45.765 --> 00:12:46.932 line:95%,end
DIANE: Would you ride that?

00:12:46.999 --> 00:12:48.634 line:95%,end
-BRANDON: Will I ride that?
-Yeah.

00:12:48.701 --> 00:12:49.535 line:95%,end
I'll ride that.

00:12:50.336 --> 00:12:52.471 line:95%,end
How about we meet you in an hour?

00:12:52.538 --> 00:12:55.508 line:95%,end
BROOKE: I think Brandon
wanted to spend some time alone,

00:12:55.574 --> 00:12:57.676 line:95%,end
so he told our parents to go.

00:12:57.743 --> 00:12:58.644 line:95%,end
Oh, my God!

00:12:58.711 --> 00:12:59.745 line:95%,end
(screams)

00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:05.618 line:95%,end
Was that fun?

00:13:05.684 --> 00:13:06.619 line:95%,end
Yeah.

00:13:06.685 --> 00:13:09.355 line:95%,end
Well, that means I can drive you around
when I get my license, right?

00:13:09.421 --> 00:13:11.257 line:95%,end
I won't try to crash like I did in that.

00:13:11.323 --> 00:13:12.291 line:95%,end
I'll die.

00:13:12.358 --> 00:13:13.559 line:95%,end
(laughs)

00:13:13.626 --> 00:13:14.927 line:95%,end
So I can't believe you're here.

00:13:14.994 --> 00:13:16.061 line:95%,end
-I know.
-I'm so excited!

00:13:16.128 --> 00:13:17.596 line:95%,end
I know. I missed you.

00:13:17.663 --> 00:13:18.831 line:95%,end
It's been weird.

00:13:18.898 --> 00:13:21.333 line:95%,end
It's just dance.
That's all that matters, dance.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.969 line:95%,end
Yeah. But if you're at the dance studio,
you're with Christi.

00:13:24.036 --> 00:13:26.205 line:95%,end
If you're going somewhere,
you're with Christi.

00:13:28.107 --> 00:13:30.276 line:5%,start
Kelly has been
my best friend for a long time,

00:13:30.342 --> 00:13:34.146 line:5%,start
and it's been difficult because
she's hanging out with Abby

00:13:34.213 --> 00:13:36.015 line:95%,end
and these crazy dance moms all the time.

00:13:36.081 --> 00:13:38.150 line:95%,end
So I don't see her very often anymore.

00:13:39.385 --> 00:13:40.553 line:95%,end
I'm home every day.

00:13:40.619 --> 00:13:41.520 line:95%,end
You know what, Kelly?

00:13:41.587 --> 00:13:42.488 line:95%,end
I call.

00:13:42.555 --> 00:13:43.722 line:95%,end
You don't answer.

00:13:44.423 --> 00:13:46.225 line:95%,end
You know, it's just easier
for me to stay away from there.

00:13:46.292 --> 00:13:47.326 line:95%,end
I just stay away.

00:13:47.393 --> 00:13:50.563 line:95%,end
KELLY: You know, Chloe
is in Paige's age category,

00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:53.432 line:95%,end
so like, our classes
are always at the same time.

00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:54.667 line:95%,end
And--

00:13:54.733 --> 00:13:55.801 line:95%,end
DIANE: Yup.

00:14:00.539 --> 00:14:03.275 line:95%,end
What do you think about
Abby sending us here?

00:14:03.342 --> 00:14:04.376 line:95%,end
She's weird.

00:14:04.443 --> 00:14:07.313 line:95%,end
I mean, but you can understand
where she's coming from, though. Right?

00:14:07.379 --> 00:14:08.247 line:95%,end
No.

00:14:08.314 --> 00:14:10.349 line:95%,end
<i>If Brandon thinks</i>

00:14:11.784 --> 00:14:12.885 line:95%,end
he's crazy.

00:14:13.552 --> 00:14:16.789 line:95%,end
All she wants us to do is
just have, like she was saying,

00:14:16.856 --> 00:14:18.090 line:95%,end
chemistry or whatever.

00:14:21.827 --> 00:14:23.462 line:95%,end
I think Brooke's excited
that Brandon's here.

00:14:23.529 --> 00:14:24.396 line:95%,end
-Yeah.
-KELLY: I do.

00:14:24.463 --> 00:14:27.933 line:95%,end
Hopefully, they can connect
doing their duet.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:28.834 line:95%,end
Oh, my God.

00:14:28.901 --> 00:14:30.769 line:95%,end
I still think they like each other.

00:14:36.141 --> 00:14:39.745 line:5%,start
Miss Abby told me and Brooke
that we have to go and build chemistry.

00:14:39.812 --> 00:14:43.015 line:95%,end
But, hey, we're doing the best we can.

00:14:43.082 --> 00:14:45.050 line:95%,end
-What do you think happened?
-BROOKE: I don't know.

00:14:45.117 --> 00:14:46.285 line:95%,end
Can't we talk about something else?

00:14:46.352 --> 00:14:48.287 line:95%,end
Like, look how high
that roller coaster is.

00:14:48.354 --> 00:14:49.855 line:95%,end
See? Look. Look. Look. Look.

00:14:52.458 --> 00:14:54.760 line:95%,end
I think Brandon likes me,
but I've moved on.

00:14:54.827 --> 00:14:58.163 line:95%,end
<i>I'm not really the same person</i>
<i>I was when I was nine years old.</i>

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:01.133 line:95%,end
Let's go ride a ride or find our moms.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.968 line:95%,end
-Whatever.
-Go find our mamas.

This week my is "Universe."


00:15:12.411 --> 00:15:14.613 line:5%,start
Each week I compete,
it gives me another chance

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.282 line:5%,start
to win another title.

00:15:16.348 --> 00:15:19.018 line:5%,start

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.929 line:95%,end
<i>My mom always tells me that,</i>

00:15:29.995 --> 00:15:33.933 line:95%,end
and she said I keep trying until I win.

00:15:34.366 --> 00:15:37.503 line:95%,end

away from Abby's studio,

any time and any place.

Holly, are you working again?

HOLLY: Well, actually,
I'm not doing work-work.

00:16:06.298 --> 00:16:08.033 line:95%,end
I'm trying to help Nia.

So right now we're all going

00:17:08.093 --> 00:17:09.695 line:95%,end

If you get up on stage

So what's been going on?

So, Abby pulled the duet

00:19:03.041 --> 00:19:06.678 line:95%,end
because you didn't come to chalkboard
and you weren't at rehearsals.

00:19:07.179 --> 00:19:09.448 line:95%,end
And Mackenzie was so upset.

00:19:10.048 --> 00:19:13.519 line:95%,end
Well, I'm sorry for Mackenzie,
but I missed my flight.

00:19:13.585 --> 00:19:15.754 line:95%,end
And we're doing the same choreography,

00:19:15.821 --> 00:19:17.122 line:95%,end
so I don't think it's a big deal.

00:19:17.189 --> 00:19:18.757 line:95%,end
But wasn't that two days ago...

00:19:18.824 --> 00:19:21.894 line:95%,end
-CATHY: Yeah. So, when was chalkboard?
-...that you missed your flight?

-Two days ago.

00:19:23.061 --> 00:19:24.429 line:95%,end
So where have you been the last two days?

00:19:24.496 --> 00:19:26.165 line:95%,end
I don't think it's a big deal.
I missed my flight.

00:19:26.698 --> 00:19:27.866 line:95%,end
Two days ago!

00:19:28.333 --> 00:19:29.735 line:95%,end
Ho I think it is a big deal
because we always

00:19:29.801 --> 00:19:30.836 line:95%,end
-have to be there.
-You know what?

00:19:30.903 --> 00:19:32.171 line:95%,end
It's the same choreography
over and over and over,

00:19:32.237 --> 00:19:35.107 line:95%,end
so I am over it.

00:19:36.208 --> 00:19:37.643 line:95%,end

We're in this room and it's a team.

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:56.061 line:95%,end
-Yeah. But you're not in--
-HOLLY: You don't get to dictate what--

00:19:56.128 --> 00:19:57.362 line:95%,end
We were here the last two days,

00:19:57.429 --> 00:19:58.830 line:95%,end
Mackenzie being upset
because she didn't get to do a duet.

00:19:58.897 --> 00:19:59.731 line:95%,end
CATHY: Okay.

00:19:59.798 --> 00:20:01.900 line:95%,end
Then maybe you guys should
have donned your tights

00:20:01.967 --> 00:20:03.135 line:95%,end
and got on stage with her.

00:20:03.202 --> 00:20:06.605 line:95%,end
Because I get so sick and tired
of hearing you guys--

00:20:06.672 --> 00:20:08.173 line:95%,end
it's a team. It's a group.
It's a team. It's a group.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:11.877 line:95%,end
Yet, Vivi is not really
in any of your numbers.

00:20:11.944 --> 00:20:14.413 line:95%,end
And I don't classify sitting on a swing

00:20:14.479 --> 00:20:16.248 line:95%,end
being in part of your numbers.

00:20:16.315 --> 00:20:18.150 line:95%,end
So, I'm not on your team.

00:20:18.217 --> 00:20:20.285 line:95%,end
-I'm not your friend.
-DANCE MOM: Why are you even yakking?

00:20:20.352 --> 00:20:22.921 line:95%,end
That dance won twice over all,
both times we did it.

00:20:22.988 --> 00:20:24.122 line:95%,end
-CATHY: You know what?
-MELISSA: At nationals.

00:20:24.189 --> 00:20:25.624 line:95%,end
And the only reason your daughter
was on the swing

00:20:25.691 --> 00:20:27.426 line:95%,end
was because she couldn't do
with the other kids were doing.

00:20:27.492 --> 00:20:29.628 line:95%,end
Well, she's also six years old, Kelly.

00:20:29.695 --> 00:20:32.064 line:95%,end
Well, you said she isn't in our dances.
We put her in.

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:33.432 line:95%,end
Why am I even arguing with you?

00:20:33.498 --> 00:20:34.866 line:95%,end
I don't care what you have to say.

00:20:34.933 --> 00:20:35.767 line:95%,end
-Okay.
-I have a comment.

00:20:35.834 --> 00:20:36.935 line:95%,end
Then if you don't care
what I have to say--

00:20:37.002 --> 00:20:38.036 line:95%,end
HOLLY: I don't care what you have to say.

00:20:38.103 --> 00:20:39.104 line:95%,end
Then you need to be quiet.

00:20:39.171 --> 00:20:41.873 line:95%,end
-Because this has nothing to do with you.
-No one tells me what to do, Cathy.

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:43.775 line:95%,end
You may as well stick
your hand up her butt

00:20:43.842 --> 00:20:45.677 line:95%,end
and beat her ventriloquist.

00:20:45.744 --> 00:20:46.945 line:95%,end
Well, then do something about it.

00:20:49.715 --> 00:20:50.549 line:95%,end
HOLLY: <i>I'm frustrated for Melissa,</i>

00:20:50.616 --> 00:20:52.884 line:95%,end
<i>because she is not</i>
<i>sticking up for herself.</i>

00:20:52.951 --> 00:20:54.419 line:5%,start
I don't believe in being a doormat.

00:20:54.486 --> 00:20:56.788 line:5%,start
It's frustrating to see
other people be doormats.

00:20:56.855 --> 00:20:58.323 line:95%,end
But if Melissa wants to be a doormat

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:00.659 line:95%,end
and have people walk
all over her, so be it.

00:21:00.726 --> 00:21:01.760 line:95%,end
I am done.

00:21:01.827 --> 00:21:06.531 line:95%,end
Even though Abby pulled a duet
and the duet didn't dance,

00:21:06.598 --> 00:21:10.102 line:95%,end
I'm here right now to support your teams.

00:21:10.168 --> 00:21:11.737 line:95%,end
That's all that matters.

00:21:11.803 --> 00:21:12.971 line:95%,end
Come on, Vivi, let's go.

00:21:13.038 --> 00:21:14.206 line:95%,end
Thank you very much, Cathy.

00:21:14.273 --> 00:21:16.041 line:95%,end
-MELISSA: Right?
-CATHY: I'm here for the awards.

00:21:16.108 --> 00:21:17.342 line:95%,end
-HOLLY: Thank you.
-KELLY: Oh, yay.

00:21:17.409 --> 00:21:19.511 line:95%,end
-Don't bother next time.
-HOLLY: Your presence is noted. Thank you.

ABBY: <i>I love Florida,</i>

00:21:28.887 --> 00:21:30.622 line:95%,end
Come on in!

00:21:30.689 --> 00:21:32.190 line:95%,end
Hello!

00:21:32.257 --> 00:21:35.027 line:5%,start
I had the kids and the moms
come on out to my house

00:21:35.093 --> 00:21:37.329 line:5%,start
to enjoy a day at the pool and have lunch.

00:21:37.396 --> 00:21:40.899 line:5%,start
My mom, the one and only
Maryen Lorrain, is home.

00:21:40.966 --> 00:21:42.534 line:5%,start
-DANCE MOM: (laughs) Hi.
-Hey.

00:21:42.601 --> 00:21:46.138 line:95%,end
ABBY: My mom is a gracious lady

00:21:46.772 --> 00:21:49.841 line:95%,end
to everybody in the world but me.

00:21:49.908 --> 00:21:51.877 line:95%,end
Grab a plate on that end.

00:21:51.943 --> 00:21:53.745 line:95%,end
Go through the line. Take your food.

00:21:53.812 --> 00:21:56.548 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:21:57.282 --> 00:21:59.685 line:95%,end
ABBY: I understand that Cathy's busy,

00:21:59.751 --> 00:22:03.455 line:95%,end
but like, you invite
someone to your house,

00:22:03.522 --> 00:22:05.891 line:95%,end
she could at least call me
and tell me she wasn't coming.

00:22:05.957 --> 00:22:07.125 line:95%,end
Who's going in?

00:22:07.192 --> 00:22:10.028 line:95%,end
(screaming)

00:22:10.095 --> 00:22:12.864 line:95%,end
-I have no idea how to make a martini.
-Oh, just pour some in there.

00:22:12.931 --> 00:22:16.335 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)


00:22:19.871 --> 00:22:20.706 line:95%,end
Ah!

00:22:20.772 --> 00:22:22.374 line:95%,end
I love the big watermelon game.

00:22:22.441 --> 00:22:23.709 line:95%,end
KELLY: You got the biggest
watermelon you could find.

00:22:23.775 --> 00:22:24.609 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Oh, my!

00:22:24.676 --> 00:22:25.844 line:95%,end
Okay. Just go.

00:22:25.911 --> 00:22:27.813 line:95%,end
<i>You put grease all over the watermelon</i>

00:22:27.879 --> 00:22:29.514 line:95%,end
<i>and you throw them in the pool.</i>

00:22:30.349 --> 00:22:31.817 line:95%,end
(screams)

00:22:31.883 --> 00:22:34.486 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>The goal of the game</i>

00:22:34.553 --> 00:22:36.922 line:95%,end
and get out of the pool
with the watermelon in your hands.

00:22:36.988 --> 00:22:39.358 line:95%,end
They fight like cats and dogs
trying to hold on,

00:22:39.424 --> 00:22:40.592 line:95%,end
and it keeps slipping out.

00:22:40.659 --> 00:22:41.927 line:95%,end
Come on!

00:22:41.993 --> 00:22:43.829 line:95%,end
(excited chatter)

00:22:43.895 --> 00:22:45.797 line:95%,end
Come on, girls! Pull it!

00:22:45.864 --> 00:22:47.165 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>It's amazing.</i>
<i>We go to Abby's house,</i>

00:22:47.232 --> 00:22:48.600 line:95%,end
<i>and the kids aren't allowed to be kids.</i>

00:22:48.667 --> 00:22:51.203 line:5%,start
It has to be turned into a competition.

00:22:51.269 --> 00:22:52.771 line:95%,end
ABBY: Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it!

00:22:52.838 --> 00:22:54.139 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Now the watermelon
just hit her there.

00:22:54.206 --> 00:22:55.941 line:95%,end
-MELISSA: Maddie got it.
-ABBY: Run!

00:22:56.575 --> 00:22:58.110 line:95%,end
-Run!
-CHRISTI: Ew. (laughs)

00:22:58.176 --> 00:22:59.378 line:95%,end
HOLLY: That looks like
a disaster waiting to happen.

00:22:59.444 --> 00:23:00.379 line:95%,end
Where do I go?

00:23:00.445 --> 00:23:01.780 line:95%,end
ABBY: You got to get up
the steps without holding it.

00:23:02.714 --> 00:23:03.982 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Why don't you just
all walk up together?

00:23:04.049 --> 00:23:04.916 line:95%,end
MELISSA: She's fine. Just leave her alone.

00:23:06.118 --> 00:23:09.321 line:95%,end
HOLLY: <i>All of a sudden,</i>
<i>Maddie starts to cry.</i>

00:23:09.388 --> 00:23:12.691 line:95%,end
And she says that she was somehow injured.

00:23:12.758 --> 00:23:15.260 line:95%,end
But, from my vantage point,
I'm looking at the game.

00:23:16.027 --> 00:23:16.995 line:95%,end
Maddie was not kicked.

00:23:17.062 --> 00:23:18.163 line:95%,end
What happened? Tell me.

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:21.133 line:95%,end
Mom, I think Nia or someone hit me.

00:23:21.199 --> 00:23:23.502 line:95%,end
Okay, then stay away from it
because it's ridiculous.

00:23:23.568 --> 00:23:25.303 line:95%,end
You're a girl. You're not a boy.

00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:27.906 line:95%,end
MELISSA: <i>Nia's pretty rough,</i>
<i>but Maddie does not</i>

00:23:27.973 --> 00:23:29.908 line:5%,start
like getting rough at all.

00:23:29.975 --> 00:23:31.042 line:95%,end
(excited chatter)

00:23:31.109 --> 00:23:31.943 line:95%,end
ABBY: Winner!

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:32.911 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Come on.

00:23:33.779 --> 00:23:35.080 line:95%,end
It's all swollen.

00:23:36.481 --> 00:23:38.583 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>Maddie cried</i>
<i>because she didn't win.</i>

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:40.786 line:95%,end
She didn't win the stupid watermelon game.

00:23:40.852 --> 00:23:44.990 line:95%,end
Somebody else got three seconds
of glory in front of four moms.

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:46.324 line:95%,end
You hurt me, look.

00:23:46.391 --> 00:23:47.826 line:95%,end
MELISSA: We're freaking girls, not boys.

00:23:47.893 --> 00:23:49.694 line:95%,end
HOLLY: <i>The child was not injured.</i>

00:23:49.761 --> 00:23:52.130 line:95%,end
<i>Melissa needs to get a better balance</i>

00:23:52.197 --> 00:23:53.799 line:95%,end

00:23:56.902 --> 00:24:00.071 line:5%,start
(dramatic music playing)

00:24:00.872 --> 00:24:02.774 line:95%,end
GIANNA: Shoulders down. Too tense.

00:24:03.708 --> 00:24:07.245 line:95%,end
MELISSA: <i>We're really excited</i>
<i>that there's more competition in Orlando,</i>

00:24:07.312 --> 00:24:08.313 line:95%,end
especially for Maddie.

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:10.215 line:95%,end
Because it's going to
challenge her a little bit.

00:24:10.282 --> 00:24:12.217 line:95%,end
And, you know, she's very competitive,

00:24:12.284 --> 00:24:14.219 line:95%,end
<i>but she likes when there's a challenge.</i>

00:24:15.086 --> 00:24:17.055 line:95%,end
GIANNA: Up and over. Hold.

00:24:17.122 --> 00:24:18.623 line:95%,end
MELISSA: <i>While Maddie was rehearsing,</i>

<i>Her name is Juliana and we've seen her</i>
<i>at other competitions</i>

00:24:25.864 --> 00:24:27.599 line:95%,end
a lot of people think that Juliana

00:24:27.666 --> 00:24:29.334 line:95%,end
is Maddie's big competition.

00:24:29.401 --> 00:24:30.402 line:95%,end
Don't get me wrong.

00:24:30.469 --> 00:24:32.337 line:95%,end
She's a sweet girl
and a great little dancer,

00:24:32.404 --> 00:24:34.206 line:95%,end
but Maddie has no competition.

00:24:34.272 --> 00:24:37.342 line:95%,end
GIANNA: Do you want to grab a drink
and go get your costume and everything?

00:24:37.409 --> 00:24:38.643 line:95%,end
-Sure.
-GIANNA: okay.

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:40.345 line:95%,end
Let's go get a drink.

00:24:41.213 --> 00:24:44.649 line:5%,start
Juliana is probably
the toughest competitor here.

00:24:44.716 --> 00:24:46.751 line:95%,end
And I think she's a really good dancer.

00:24:46.818 --> 00:24:49.087 line:95%,end
But I think I have
a good chance of beating her.

(suspenseful music playing)

00:24:50.255 --> 00:24:51.823 line:95%,end

Yes.

MELISSA: Well, Mackenzie
is a good tumbler too.

00:25:10.675 --> 00:25:13.144 line:95%,end
And does it really matter
who wins or does it really matter

00:25:13.211 --> 00:25:14.045 line:95%,end
who has fun?

00:25:14.112 --> 00:25:15.080 line:95%,end
That's right.

00:25:15.146 --> 00:25:16.982 line:95%,end
What's the answer?

00:25:18.617 --> 00:25:20.352 line:95%,end
I don't care if I don't win.

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:34.593 line:5%,start
This is something new
that we've seen here,

00:26:34.659 --> 00:26:35.927 line:5%,start

And I don't let the competition get to me.

00:27:15.367 --> 00:27:19.170 line:95%,end
But now it's the interview
part in the pageant

00:27:19.237 --> 00:27:20.405 line:95%,end
and I'm super nervous.

00:27:20.472 --> 00:27:22.574 line:95%,end
GIANNA: You've been
in the pageant for a long time.

00:27:22.641 --> 00:27:24.075 line:95%,end
You know how to do this.

00:27:24.142 --> 00:27:27.345 line:95%,end
Some of them have probably never spoken
in front of judges before. Right?

00:27:27.412 --> 00:27:29.414 line:95%,end
-Mm-hmm.
-Just stop it.

She did good, didn't she?

She walked gorgeous.

00:28:18.663 --> 00:28:19.931 line:95%,end
Did she speak well?

00:28:19.998 --> 00:28:21.566 line:95%,end
She did speak perfect.

00:28:21.633 --> 00:28:22.467 line:95%,end
Aw!

00:28:22.534 --> 00:28:26.204 line:95%,end
MADDIE: Juliana is a good speaker
and she didn't mess up once.

00:28:26.271 --> 00:28:29.007 line:95%,end
And I kind of mumbled once or twice.

00:28:29.074 --> 00:28:32.043 line:95%,end

Come on. You ready, Nia?

00:29:10.682 --> 00:29:12.450 line:95%,end
Brandon, Brooke,
what's going on over there?

00:29:12.517 --> 00:29:13.985 line:95%,end
You both look miserable.

00:29:14.052 --> 00:29:17.155 line:95%,end
You should draw the judge's eyes
over to you. That's the choreography.

00:29:17.222 --> 00:29:20.725 line:95%,end
If they look over and see
vanilla paste drying,

00:29:20.792 --> 00:29:22.460 line:95%,end
they're not going to keep looking over.

00:29:22.527 --> 00:29:25.363 line:5%,start
It's obvious that Brooke and Brandon
are not having the connection.

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:28.900 line:95%,end
Abby's not happy about it,
but she should have expected this.

00:29:28.967 --> 00:29:31.102 line:95%,end
This is why we didn't do a duet last year.

00:29:32.604 --> 00:29:35.974 line:95%,end
BRANDON: With the dance, I've been trying
to connect with Brooke the whole week.

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:39.177 line:95%,end
But she's been pretty cold towards me.

00:29:39.244 --> 00:29:41.246 line:95%,end

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:44.249 line:95%,end
BRANDON: We do the turns one time. Turn.

00:29:44.315 --> 00:29:46.484 line:95%,end
Strong arms, Brooke.
Your hands are so lazy.

00:29:48.119 --> 00:29:51.189 line:95%,end
It's the only thing I'm worried about,
when she's sliding down.

00:29:51.256 --> 00:29:53.158 line:95%,end
-You cut me.
-Shut up.

00:29:53.224 --> 00:29:54.225 line:95%,end
You're fine.

00:29:54.292 --> 00:29:55.393 line:95%,end
It's a belt.

It was a mess.

Brooke's legs were bent.

Her feet weren't pointed.

It was just the technique, you know?

00:30:35.333 --> 00:30:36.334 line:95%,end
Hit or miss.

KELLY: Brooke and Brandon
were supposed to be falling in love,

00:30:40.839 --> 00:30:43.708 line:95%,end

No. We have to leave.

This is like, the dream team.

We are rehearsing Nia's solo.

I want Nia to put her
Bollywood costume on.

Holly's always upset because Nia

to learn things.

00:32:18.403 --> 00:32:19.537 line:95%,end
Come on. I--you know what?

00:32:19.604 --> 00:32:20.872 line:95%,end
Let me just have her rehearse.

00:32:20.939 --> 00:32:23.241 line:95%,end
Get over it, you know,
man up. Get over it.

00:32:23.308 --> 00:32:25.443 line:95%,end
Learn the number, go out there, sell it.

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:27.312 line:95%,end
And, you know, quit giving in to that.

00:32:27.378 --> 00:32:31.316 line:95%,end
I just think that she's weaker
instead of stronger.

00:32:31.382 --> 00:32:32.817 line:95%,end
Are the feet flexed or pointed?

00:32:32.884 --> 00:32:34.886 line:95%,end
See, you can't decide once you get there.

00:32:36.087 --> 00:32:37.221 line:95%,end
Arms straighter!

00:32:38.556 --> 00:32:40.358 line:95%,end
Bigger! Bigger! Bigger!

00:32:41.993 --> 00:32:43.027 line:95%,end
Give me something!

00:32:43.094 --> 00:32:44.529 line:95%,end
You're, like, at a funeral.

HOLLY: Nia's name
is screamed out constantly.

00:32:46.864 --> 00:32:49.300 line:95%,end
ABBY: Nia! Boom! Hip!

00:32:49.367 --> 00:32:52.603 line:95%,end
It's in a nasty, barking way.

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:53.905 line:95%,end
It's really mean.

00:32:53.972 --> 00:32:55.039 line:95%,end
ABBY: Do it.

00:32:56.007 --> 00:32:57.308 line:95%,end
Kick.

00:32:57.375 --> 00:32:58.209 line:95%,end
See, this is--this step--

00:32:58.276 --> 00:33:00.011 line:95%,end
Yeah, but she's getting frustrated now.

00:33:00.078 --> 00:33:03.247 line:95%,end
That kick--kick, catch
has been in every one

00:33:03.314 --> 00:33:04.382 line:95%,end
of your dances.

00:33:04.449 --> 00:33:06.150 line:95%,end
So that should be perfect.

00:33:06.217 --> 00:33:09.120 line:95%,end
HOLLY: If you hear it one way,
I think she's feeling it another way.

00:33:09.187 --> 00:33:11.122 line:95%,end
-'Cause it's--
-ABBY: Yeah. But, Holly,

00:33:11.189 --> 00:33:12.657 line:95%,end
we're right back to the same thing.

00:33:12.724 --> 00:33:14.859 line:95%,end
I don't need to be here
doing this with her.

00:33:14.926 --> 00:33:18.629 line:95%,end
Holly has to stop questioning
my every move.

00:33:18.696 --> 00:33:22.100 line:95%,end
It's always this little underlying dig,

00:33:22.166 --> 00:33:24.502 line:95%,end
like Nia's not good enough.

00:33:24.569 --> 00:33:25.803 line:95%,end
Nia's not tall enough.

00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:28.239 line:95%,end
Nia's not skinny enough.
Nia's not this enough.

00:33:28.306 --> 00:33:29.540 line:95%,end
Get over it.

00:33:29.607 --> 00:33:30.742 line:95%,end
Trust me.

00:33:30.808 --> 00:33:33.978 line:95%,end
As a teacher, we give them
the tools, we do our job.

00:33:34.045 --> 00:33:36.180 line:95%,end
It's up to them to go out
in the world and use them.

00:33:36.247 --> 00:33:37.148 line:95%,end
I disagree with that.

00:33:37.215 --> 00:33:38.983 line:95%,end
If I need to wipe her
butt all the way there,

00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:40.585 line:95%,end
that's ridiculous.

00:33:40.651 --> 00:33:41.853 line:95%,end
It's vicious at times.

00:33:41.919 --> 00:33:46.657 line:95%,end
And sometimes I don't think Abby
realizes the way that she says things,

00:33:46.724 --> 00:33:49.127 line:95%,end
and how hurtful her words are.

00:33:49.193 --> 00:33:50.628 line:95%,end
And I'm not asking you to wipe her butt.

00:33:50.695 --> 00:33:51.529 line:95%,end
I'm asking you to do your job.

00:33:51.596 --> 00:33:54.065 line:95%,end
When you talk to Maddie
and you're giving her corrections,

00:33:54.132 --> 00:33:56.000 line:95%,end
you're not barking at her
and yelling at her.

00:33:56.067 --> 00:33:57.235 line:95%,end
Wrong! How many times did I tell you this?

00:33:57.301 --> 00:33:59.404 line:95%,end
Time and time again.
You never talk to her that way.

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:01.172 line:95%,end
Because I have to tell her once.

00:34:01.239 --> 00:34:03.574 line:95%,end
I don't know what Holly's
problem is this week.

00:34:03.641 --> 00:34:07.445 line:95%,end
But she said to me,
you're just barking orders at her.

00:34:07.512 --> 00:34:10.415 line:95%,end
You're just barking at her,
which was like calling me a dog,

00:34:10.481 --> 00:34:11.582 line:95%,end
which I do not appreciate.

00:34:11.649 --> 00:34:14.352 line:95%,end
Go out there, flex, point,

00:34:14.419 --> 00:34:16.154 line:95%,end
do what you're supposed to do.

00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:18.489 line:95%,end
-And we'll see if the judges like it.
-Thank you.

00:34:22.226 --> 00:34:25.229 line:95%,end
(dramatic music playing)

00:34:31.302 --> 00:34:32.370 line:95%,end
What's wrong?

00:34:32.437 --> 00:34:33.271 line:95%,end
It's okay.

00:34:37.942 --> 00:34:38.976 line:95%,end
I'm sorry.


00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:42.980 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:34:43.047 --> 00:34:45.450 line:95%,end
HOLLY: When you talk to Maddie,
you're not barking at her.

00:34:45.516 --> 00:34:46.951 line:95%,end
'Cause I have to tell her once.

00:34:47.018 --> 00:34:48.286 line:95%,end
What's wrong?

00:34:48.352 --> 00:34:49.253 line:95%,end
It's okay.

00:34:50.021 --> 00:34:51.122 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Deep breath.

00:34:51.823 --> 00:34:53.691 line:95%,end
Come on. You're our rock, honey.

00:34:58.096 --> 00:34:59.297 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>I've spent</i>
<i>a lot of time with Holly.</i>

00:34:59.363 --> 00:35:00.898 line:5%,start
I have never seen her get emotional.

00:35:00.965 --> 00:35:04.435 line:5%,start
She's a stone mountain,
and she was crying her heart out.

00:35:04.502 --> 00:35:08.239 line:95%,end
Because when it's your daughter it hurts.

00:35:08.773 --> 00:35:12.076 line:95%,end
HOLLY: I was okay until I saw her
sitting there and she's upset.

00:35:12.143 --> 00:35:12.977 line:95%,end
I know.

00:35:13.044 --> 00:35:15.113 line:95%,end
I never thought I would
let dance get to me.

00:35:15.179 --> 00:35:16.247 line:95%,end
I know.

00:35:16.314 --> 00:35:18.182 line:95%,end
<i>I think Holly finally stepped back</i>

00:35:18.249 --> 00:35:21.652 line:95%,end
from that educator's stance
and she became a mother.

00:35:21.719 --> 00:35:25.857 line:95%,end
And she saw what I go through every week.

00:35:25.923 --> 00:35:27.125 line:95%,end
All of a sudden it just hit me.

00:35:27.191 --> 00:35:30.328 line:95%,end
Like, I have allowed it
to get to this point.

00:35:30.394 --> 00:35:31.696 line:95%,end
And I felt bad.

00:35:31.762 --> 00:35:32.763 line:95%,end
-Like, I feel so responsible.
-I know.

00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:34.332 line:95%,end
But how many times do you apologize?

00:35:34.398 --> 00:35:36.467 line:95%,end
-I subjected her to this.
-I know.

00:35:36.534 --> 00:35:38.536 line:95%,end
I subjected her to Abby.
And Abby doesn't get it.

00:35:38.603 --> 00:35:39.637 line:95%,end
I'm like--(sighs)

00:35:39.704 --> 00:35:40.738 line:95%,end
Wipe your tears.

00:35:40.805 --> 00:35:42.740 line:95%,end
We can't go out there looking
like this because we have--

00:35:42.807 --> 00:35:44.876 line:95%,end
we have to go out there
and look intimidating.

00:35:44.942 --> 00:35:47.178 line:95%,end
So that's why we have to be dressed up.

00:35:47.245 --> 00:35:48.079 line:95%,end
Goodbye.

00:35:48.146 --> 00:35:49.046 line:95%,end
HOLLY: (laughs)

00:35:49.113 --> 00:35:50.381 line:95%,end
Bye, Nia.

00:35:52.016 --> 00:35:52.950 line:95%,end
Bye, girls.

00:35:53.017 --> 00:35:53.851 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: By, Hol.

00:35:53.918 --> 00:35:54.952 line:95%,end
Bye.

00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:57.688 line:95%,end
(dramatic music playing)

00:35:57.755 --> 00:36:00.391 line:95%,end
Okay. How you doing, okay?

00:36:00.458 --> 00:36:01.659 line:95%,end
You know the dance?

00:36:01.726 --> 00:36:02.593 line:95%,end
Mm-hmm.

00:36:03.461 --> 00:36:04.595 line:95%,end
I love you.

00:36:04.662 --> 00:36:06.030 line:95%,end
<i>I'm feeling better right now</i>

00:36:06.097 --> 00:36:08.900 line:5%,start
after having a conversation
with Christi for a little bit

00:36:08.966 --> 00:36:12.436 line:5%,start
and checking in with Nia,
who unfortunately was giving me

00:36:12.503 --> 00:36:14.705 line:95%,end
the support I'm supposed to be giving her.

00:36:15.273 --> 00:36:16.307 line:95%,end
<i>So I felt bad about that.</i>

00:36:16.374 --> 00:36:18.843 line:95%,end
I'm supposed to be the person
who's supposed to be her rock,

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:19.944 line:95%,end
and I fell apart.

00:36:21.712 --> 00:36:23.147 line:95%,end
Let's go. Let's go.

00:36:26.817 --> 00:36:30.154 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:36:32.023 --> 00:36:34.358 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:36:35.927 --> 00:36:37.795 line:95%,end
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Please welcome to the stage Nia.</i>

00:36:37.862 --> 00:36:40.331 line:95%,end
(cheering and applause)

00:36:50.341 --> 00:36:52.243 line:95%,end
HOLLY: <i>I'm in the audience</i>
<i>when Nia comes out.</i>

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:54.178 line:95%,end
<i>I'm thinking of all the corrections</i>
<i>that she needs to made.</i>

00:36:54.245 --> 00:36:56.214 line:95%,end
<i>She's either going to do the corrections</i>

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:58.616 line:95%,end
and forget the routine
or she's going to do the routine

00:36:58.683 --> 00:36:59.850 line:95%,end
and not do the corrections.

00:36:59.917 --> 00:37:03.854 line:5%,start
Her little head, her brain,
can hold but so much information.

00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:07.892 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:37:15.366 --> 00:37:19.837 line:95%,end
SINGER: (singing in foreign language)

00:38:00.478 --> 00:38:03.180 line:95%,end
HOLLY: <i>She did a great job.</i>
<i>She should be really proud of herself.</i>

00:38:03.247 --> 00:38:05.349 line:95%,end
I was happy with her.
I was thrilled, actually.

00:38:09.287 --> 00:38:11.656 line:5%,start
(ominous music playing)

00:38:11.722 --> 00:38:13.190 line:95%,end
I think she might be next.

00:38:14.025 --> 00:38:16.527 line:95%,end
ANNOUNCER: <i>We have some</i>
<i>special awards to give away.</i>

00:38:16.594 --> 00:38:17.728 line:95%,end
<i>Here we go.</i>

00:38:18.796 --> 00:38:21.832 line:95%,end
<i>Nine to 11 Full Floor.</i>

00:38:21.899 --> 00:38:25.102 line:95%,end
<i>With a 441-A, Nia with "Bollywood,"</i>

00:38:25.169 --> 00:38:28.506 line:95%,end
<i>for her stars and first place trophy.</i>

<i>Nine to 11 Hip Hop, number 442, Tessa--</i>

00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:35.313 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>Nia was first place in her category,</i>

00:38:35.379 --> 00:38:37.081 line:5%,start
and that hasn't happened all season.

00:38:37.148 --> 00:38:39.150 line:95%,end
<i>I was really proud of her.</i>
<i>She looked beautiful.</i>

00:38:39.216 --> 00:38:40.351 line:95%,end
<i>She did a great job.</i>

00:38:40.418 --> 00:38:42.853 line:95%,end
<i>I think Nia has really come a long way.</i>

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:46.357 line:95%,end
HOLLY: (squeals) You won!

00:38:46.424 --> 00:38:48.092 line:95%,end
I knew you could do it.

00:38:48.159 --> 00:38:50.094 line:95%,end
You're so awesome.

00:38:50.161 --> 00:38:52.663 line:95%,end
<i>So "Laquifa" didn't win, but Nia did.</i>

00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:53.898 line:95%,end
I am so happy.

00:38:53.964 --> 00:38:55.232 line:95%,end
I'm thrilled.

00:38:55.299 --> 00:38:56.167 line:95%,end
Yes!

00:38:56.233 --> 00:38:58.469 line:95%,end
(indistinct chatter)

00:39:00.271 --> 00:39:02.239 line:95%,end
What do we think, girls?

00:39:02.306 --> 00:39:04.608 line:95%,end
<i>We have had an amazing competition season.</i>

00:39:04.675 --> 00:39:07.345 line:95%,end
The Dream Team has been doing so well.

00:39:07.411 --> 00:39:10.047 line:95%,end
Maddie is undefeated with her solos.

00:39:10.114 --> 00:39:12.249 line:95%,end
So I have a little more news.

00:39:13.984 --> 00:39:16.287 line:95%,end
I think your mothers are going
to fall off their chairs.

00:39:16.354 --> 00:39:17.988 line:95%,end
Oh, God. What?

00:39:18.055 --> 00:39:20.024 line:95%,end
We're going from here

00:39:20.091 --> 00:39:21.692 line:95%,end
to Vegas,

00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:24.195 line:95%,end
to Los Angeles, California,

00:39:24.261 --> 00:39:25.963 line:95%,end
and to Lake Tahoe.

00:39:27.131 --> 00:39:28.799 line:95%,end
I'm not gonna fall off my chair.

00:39:28.866 --> 00:39:30.401 line:95%,end
I'm gonna shoot myself.

00:39:30.468 --> 00:39:33.003 line:95%,end
And you better be the overall high scorer.

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:34.138 line:95%,end
Do you understand?

00:39:34.205 --> 00:39:36.407 line:95%,end
I don't think the moms are so excited.

00:39:36.474 --> 00:39:37.942 line:5%,start
We're doing a world tour.

00:39:38.008 --> 00:39:39.009 line:5%,start
It's ridiculous.

00:39:39.076 --> 00:39:40.311 line:95%,end
-No moms! No moms!
-KELLY: We'll hang at the pool

00:39:40.378 --> 00:39:41.746 line:95%,end
while you have the kids.

00:39:41.812 --> 00:39:43.447 line:95%,end
No moms! No moms! Come on.

00:39:43.514 --> 00:39:44.582 line:95%,end
Help me out here.

00:39:44.648 --> 00:39:46.617 line:95%,end
CATHY: <i>This is not possible for us.</i>

00:39:46.684 --> 00:39:51.622 line:5%,start
We did not bargain
for this kind of travel.

00:39:51.689 --> 00:39:55.393 line:95%,end
I've got committed things happening
at home for my dance studio,

00:39:55.459 --> 00:39:57.261 line:95%,end
<i>so it's not possible. We're not doing it.</i>

00:39:57.328 --> 00:39:58.195 line:95%,end
ABBY: You don't look very happy.

00:39:58.262 --> 00:40:00.965 line:95%,end
Okay, well, we're not going
to go to Las Vegas.

00:40:02.366 --> 00:40:03.401 line:95%,end
Okay.

00:40:03.467 --> 00:40:05.336 line:95%,end
We're getting off the party train.

00:40:05.403 --> 00:40:08.005 line:95%,end
We just are not going to be able to--

00:40:08.072 --> 00:40:09.006 line:95%,end
-to accommodate this.
-ABBY: And there's nobody--

00:40:09.073 --> 00:40:10.307 line:95%,end
like, your mom can't just bring her or--

00:40:10.374 --> 00:40:11.342 line:95%,end
No. No.

00:40:11.409 --> 00:40:14.412 line:95%,end
And you know that Vivi's not going to go
with anybody but me anyhow. So--

00:40:14.478 --> 00:40:15.513 line:95%,end
I thought maybe your mom.

00:40:15.579 --> 00:40:17.081 line:95%,end
Yeah. No, she's not going to do that.

00:40:18.516 --> 00:40:19.884 line:95%,end
Just not gonna work for us.

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:21.652 line:5%,start
Hey, everyone's replaceable.

00:40:21.719 --> 00:40:23.053 line:5%,start
You know that.

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:24.822 line:5%,start
Yep, even dance teachers.

00:40:25.890 --> 00:40:27.658 line:5%,start
If I'm going to go on tour,

00:40:27.725 --> 00:40:31.429 line:5%,start
I'm going to go on tour with my students
who are winning platinums.

00:40:31.495 --> 00:40:33.030 line:5%,start
I respect you as a teacher.

00:40:33.097 --> 00:40:34.198 line:5%,start
I think you're wonderful.

00:40:34.265 --> 00:40:35.633 line:5%,start
I'm not going to Vegas.

00:40:36.167 --> 00:40:37.468 line:5%,start
Well, you're a quitter.

00:40:37.535 --> 00:40:38.369 line:5%,start
Whatever.

00:40:41.439 --> 00:40:44.175 line:5%,start
ABBY: It's the people that you just bend
over backwards for,

00:40:44.241 --> 00:40:46.944 line:5%,start
you give the opportunity to,
you don't stick to your rules,

00:40:47.011 --> 00:40:48.612 line:5%,start
and this is how it turns out.
