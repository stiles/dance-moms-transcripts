Mistakes like that don't happen to me.

I'm not gonna have you treat me like this.

-You act like one.

00:02:40.727 --> 00:02:42.095 line:95%,end
You're screaming at me

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:42.996 line:95%,end
You screwed up.

If you're gonna come on the trip,
she's yours.

Stay out of the bar,
stay in the dressing room,

00:02:47.767 --> 00:02:51.137 line:95%,end
when she goes on stage,
the headpiece is sewed in the head.

00:02:51.204 --> 00:02:52.338 line:95%,end
Do you understand?

00:02:52.405 --> 00:02:53.973 line:95%,end
Next time, have it right.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.308 line:95%,end
-Yeah.
-I'm not gonna put up with it.

00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:57.177 line:95%,end
Remember, I pay your bills.

You work for me.

00:02:58.578 --> 00:03:00.580 line:95%,end
I pay you to teach my daughter dancing.

00:03:00.647 --> 00:03:02.182 line:95%,end
I'm not gonna have you treat me like this.

00:03:02.248 --> 00:03:03.550 line:95%,end
-That's right.

00:03:03.616 --> 00:03:04.551 line:95%,end
I'm done.

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:08.521 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>Number 14.</i>

00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:12.358 line:95%,end
Kelly's children have been
at my studio since they were born.

00:03:12.425 --> 00:03:15.929 line:95%,end
<i>And Brooke has had beautiful</i>
<i>pieces choreographed for her,</i>

00:03:15.995 --> 00:03:17.363 line:95%,end
<i>as well as Paige.</i>

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.698 line:95%,end
I do their numbers.

00:03:18.765 --> 00:03:20.233 line:95%,end
I've always done the numbers.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.602 line:95%,end
But you know what?
I'm sick and tired of yelling at her kids.

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:25.271 line:95%,end
<i>So if she wants to go get a choreographer</i>
<i>to work with them,</i>

00:03:25.338 --> 00:03:27.473 line:95%,end
go ahead, and see how much it costs her.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.376 line:95%,end
So this week in Los Angeles,
I took it in my own hands

00:03:30.443 --> 00:03:33.546 line:95%,end
and I'm hiring Paige
her own choreographer.

00:03:33.613 --> 00:03:35.582 line:95%,end
I think Abby just kind of pushes her aside

00:03:35.648 --> 00:03:38.618 line:95%,end
and I wanted to try to get her
some better choreography

00:03:38.685 --> 00:03:40.653 line:95%,end
-that will work for her.
-Totally.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.288 line:95%,end
We're really short on time.

00:03:42.355 --> 00:03:44.524 line:95%,end
I think she's a little nervous about that.

00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:46.426 line:95%,end
Well, we'll work
at whatever pace you need.

00:03:46.492 --> 00:03:50.597 line:95%,end
And I've danced with Lady Gaga,
Kesha, Adam Lambert.

00:03:50.663 --> 00:03:52.398 line:95%,end
So you're in good hands.

00:03:52.465 --> 00:03:56.669 line:95%,end
KELLY: Show Miss Abby that, look,
I learned this cool dance without you.

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:58.371 line:95%,end
That's what you need to show her.

00:03:58.438 --> 00:04:01.975 line:95%,end
When I enter a competition,
those are my numbers.

00:04:02.041 --> 00:04:03.276 line:95%,end
Those are my routines.

00:04:03.343 --> 00:04:06.045 line:95%,end
<i>I am not going to let Paige turn around</i>

00:04:06.112 --> 00:04:08.014 line:95%,end
<i>and do some other choreographer's routine</i>

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:10.216 line:95%,end
that I've never even seen
before under my name.

00:04:10.283 --> 00:04:11.584 line:95%,end
Not going to happen.

00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:13.152 line:95%,end
I'm not gonna put somebody on my stage

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:15.221 line:95%,end
that I haven't even seen
their dance under my name.

00:04:15.288 --> 00:04:16.789 line:95%,end
KELLY: They love to be
in the group numbers.

00:04:16.856 --> 00:04:18.291 line:95%,end
They want to be with their friends.

00:04:18.358 --> 00:04:20.059 line:95%,end
They want to be with you.

00:04:20.126 --> 00:04:22.495 line:95%,end
But if you do that,
then you're not a part of the group.

00:04:22.562 --> 00:04:24.464 line:95%,end
If you register your kids
as an independent,

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:25.865 line:95%,end
they can't be part of the group.

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:29.502 line:95%,end
KELLY: Abby, all's want is for my kids

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:31.170 line:95%,end
to get good choreography.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.810 line:95%,end
For you to be unhappy
with your choreography is a joke.

00:04:37.877 --> 00:04:41.180 line:95%,end
And I have done brilliant work for her,
adorable work.

00:04:41.247 --> 00:04:42.749 line:95%,end
People call me after the competitions.

00:04:42.815 --> 00:04:43.750 line:95%,end
I want that music.

00:04:43.816 --> 00:04:45.184 line:95%,end
<i>Oh, where did you get that costume?</i>

00:04:45.251 --> 00:04:48.288 line:95%,end
<i>And now, suddenly,</i>
<i>she's gonna find something better?</i>

00:04:48.354 --> 00:04:50.857 line:95%,end
KELLY: I don't know.
I mean, just that one little thing

00:04:50.923 --> 00:04:52.258 line:95%,end
to make them feel special.


00:04:52.325 --> 00:04:55.128 line:95%,end
But I wasn't put on this Earth
to make her feel special.

00:04:55.194 --> 00:04:57.163 line:95%,end
I was put on this Earth to make her dance.

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:58.965 line:95%,end
<i>Kelly just doesn't get it.</i>

00:04:59.032 --> 00:05:01.367 line:95%,end
<i>Her kids do not pick up quickly.</i>

00:05:01.434 --> 00:05:04.570 line:95%,end
And she thinks that if she had somebody
to work with her kids

00:05:04.637 --> 00:05:06.939 line:95%,end
every single week for a half an hour

00:05:07.006 --> 00:05:09.876 line:95%,end
that their solos
would be winning like Maddie's.

00:05:09.942 --> 00:05:11.711 line:95%,end
And I taught her a great routine.

00:05:11.778 --> 00:05:13.179 line:95%,end
You didn't even look at it.

00:05:16.582 --> 00:05:18.184 line:95%,end
KELLY: I hired those choreographers
yesterday.

00:05:18.251 --> 00:05:19.085 line:95%,end
ABBY: Right.

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:22.655 line:95%,end
And they didn't have enough time
to finish their dances.

00:05:24.023 --> 00:05:25.591 line:95%,end
ABBY: You wanted an outside choreographer.

00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:26.559 line:95%,end
I know that, Abby.

00:05:26.626 --> 00:05:28.394 line:95%,end
You either need to pull out of the groups

00:05:28.461 --> 00:05:30.863 line:95%,end
and go as an independent
and do the numbers

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.565 line:95%,end
-and prove me wrong.
-Yeah, but if I was doing it--

00:05:32.632 --> 00:05:35.702 line:95%,end
And they need you to beat
every other 13-year-old,

00:05:35.768 --> 00:05:37.303 line:95%,end
and she needs to beat Chloe and Maddie.

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:38.738 line:95%,end
It's just blowing up in her face.

00:05:38.805 --> 00:05:41.307 line:95%,end
KELLY: I'm not doing it to my kids.
I'm not.

00:05:41.974 --> 00:05:42.842 line:95%,end
Don't cry.

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:44.610 line:95%,end
It's all your fault to begin with.

00:05:44.677 --> 00:05:46.479 line:95%,end
-Can't we just be smart?
-WOMAN: Just pull the number.

00:05:47.113 --> 00:05:49.482 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>And now number 13.</i>

00:05:50.049 --> 00:05:51.784 line:95%,end
Every dancer knows.

00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:55.021 line:95%,end
<i>Desire, discipline, dedication.</i>

00:05:55.088 --> 00:05:57.323 line:95%,end
<i>That's what it takes</i>
<i>to make it in this business.</i>

00:05:57.924 --> 00:06:00.727 line:95%,end
But with these moms,
you can throw that out the window.

00:06:00.793 --> 00:06:01.627 line:95%,end
<i>How dare they?</i>

00:06:01.694 --> 00:06:03.763 line:95%,end
<i>They can't even pay</i>
<i>their bills at the studio,</i>

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:04.997 line:95%,end

right here, anybody who is 40,

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.552 line:95%,end
start to think about that.

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:28.788 line:95%,end
You've got the opportunity
to look better and look younger.

-Why not take advantage of it?

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.859 line:95%,end
I'm in. I think we should do it.

00:06:32.925 --> 00:06:34.127 line:95%,end
CATHY: Here we go.

00:06:34.193 --> 00:06:36.362 line:95%,end
It looks like a dentist's office.

00:06:36.429 --> 00:06:39.065 line:95%,end
-Oh.
-I'm not a big fan of the dentist, either.

00:06:39.132 --> 00:06:40.500 line:95%,end
-Ew.
-I don't like the way it looks.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.335 line:95%,end
Oh, my God. Look at those needles.

00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:44.170 line:95%,end
Oh, I'm scared.

00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:45.304 line:95%,end
Yeah, I'm very nervous.

00:06:45.371 --> 00:06:46.773 line:95%,end
I'm afraid of side effects.

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:48.941 line:95%,end
Like, they say you can have droopy eyelid

00:06:49.008 --> 00:06:50.009 line:95%,end
and things like that.

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:52.378 line:95%,end
And I'm just hoping
that everything turns out okay.

00:06:52.445 --> 00:06:53.479 line:95%,end

00:06:53.546 --> 00:06:54.714 line:95%,end
Frown, frown, frown.

00:06:54.781 --> 00:06:56.816 line:95%,end
It's gonna be three quick pinches.

-You okay?
-BOTOX TECHNICIAN: Two.

00:06:58.985 --> 00:07:00.086 line:95%,end
CATHY: That was quick.

00:07:00.153 --> 00:07:03.823 line:95%,end
She has tons of wrinkles

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:05.057 line:95%,end
She really needs help.

00:07:05.124 --> 00:07:06.459 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: You have tons.

BOTOX TECHNICIAN: Pinch. Ready?

00:07:08.194 --> 00:07:09.896 line:95%,end
Right between the brows here.

00:07:09.962 --> 00:07:11.030 line:95%,end
I can't believe how fast it is.

-It's wonderful.
-I know.

00:07:11.998 --> 00:07:13.599 line:95%,end
That's why people
do it on their lunch hour.

00:07:13.666 --> 00:07:14.901 line:95%,end
I'll be back tomorrow.

00:07:14.967 --> 00:07:15.968 line:95%,end
It didn't really even hurt.

00:07:16.035 --> 00:07:18.704 line:95%,end
<i>I think it hurts more</i>
<i>to get your ears pierced.</i>

00:07:18.771 --> 00:07:20.239 line:95%,end
I was happily surprised.

00:07:20.306 --> 00:07:23.443 line:95%,end
So a couple little pricks and off we go.

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:25.478 line:95%,end

-Mm-hmm.

you didn't get it done, though.

00:07:27.213 --> 00:07:28.548 line:95%,end

KELLY: Never had any intention
of getting Botox until we met her.

00:07:34.454 --> 00:07:35.822 line:95%,end
CATHY: Yeah, but I can tell you right now,

00:07:35.888 --> 00:07:37.657 line:95%,end
you are gonna to be junkies with it.

00:07:37.723 --> 00:07:39.592 line:95%,end
-So you're good.
-Better keep getting Botox.

00:07:39.659 --> 00:07:42.361 line:95%,end
I don't want anybody
to think I'm Chloe's grandma.

00:07:43.296 --> 00:07:44.464 line:95%,end

Take a look. You'll see what I mean.

00:12:36.922 --> 00:12:37.890 line:95%,end
Nia?

00:12:39.358 --> 00:12:41.460 line:95%,end
(laughs)

00:12:43.229 --> 00:12:45.264 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Where's the rest of her costume?

00:12:46.432 --> 00:12:47.633 line:95%,end
That's it.

00:12:48.134 --> 00:12:49.268 line:95%,end
We need to spice it up.

00:12:49.335 --> 00:12:51.737 line:95%,end
-I guess we're going for skin to win?
-ABBY: Yes.

00:12:51.804 --> 00:12:54.673 line:95%,end
So French twist with the curls on top.

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:56.275 line:95%,end
How are we wearing the socks?

00:12:56.342 --> 00:12:59.912 line:95%,end
ABBY: Two inches above the knee,
bare legs,

00:12:59.979 --> 00:13:02.915 line:95%,end
and use your double-stick lingerie tape.


00:13:02.982 --> 00:13:04.116 line:95%,end
I'm gonna give you the stones

00:13:04.183 --> 00:13:06.952 line:95%,end
when we're finished with the fittings
and you can get stoning them.

00:13:07.019 --> 00:13:08.354 line:95%,end
So you're good.

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:10.389 line:95%,end
You want to send the next girl in, please?

00:13:10.456 --> 00:13:11.524 line:95%,end
Oh, Lord.

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:14.360 line:95%,end
<i>We're headed to Lancaster, Pennsylvania</i>
<i>for a competition.</i>

00:13:14.426 --> 00:13:16.962 line:95%,end
And it's home of Amish buggies
and bonnets.

00:13:17.029 --> 00:13:19.064 line:95%,end
Our regular dancewear
would cause a few people

00:13:19.131 --> 00:13:21.600 line:95%,end
out in Lancaster to have a stroke,
let alone these things.

00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:25.070 line:95%,end
KELLY: Guys, we gotta wear
stuff like this.

00:13:25.137 --> 00:13:27.439 line:95%,end
Like, when we were in Phoenix
last weekend,

00:13:27.506 --> 00:13:29.308 line:95%,end
everybody had outfits on like this.

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:32.411 line:95%,end
Oh.

00:13:33.345 --> 00:13:35.214 line:95%,end
Showing off your sexy little bod.

00:13:35.281 --> 00:13:38.250 line:95%,end
Just--we want these on the side, I guess?

00:13:38.317 --> 00:13:39.752 line:95%,end
They look like little tarts.

00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:41.287 line:95%,end
They do not look like little girls.

00:13:41.353 --> 00:13:43.956 line:95%,end
KELLY: They don't think of it as,
they're dancing in a bra.

00:13:44.023 --> 00:13:45.491 line:95%,end
-It's their costume.
-But you know what?

00:13:45.558 --> 00:13:46.892 line:95%,end
There are people
in the audience who see them,

00:13:46.959 --> 00:13:48.194 line:95%,end
and they think they're dancing in a bra.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:49.461 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: We've had costumes smaller.

00:13:49.528 --> 00:13:51.664 line:95%,end
It's that it looks sleazy.

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:52.832 line:95%,end
HOLLY: I think it's too sexy.

00:13:52.898 --> 00:13:54.733 line:95%,end
I absolutely think it's too sexy.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.535 line:95%,end
You know what?
Can we not use the word sexy?

00:13:56.602 --> 00:13:57.837 line:95%,end
Can we just say skimpy?

00:13:57.903 --> 00:13:59.104 line:95%,end
HOLLY: We could say scandalous.

00:13:59.171 --> 00:14:00.172 line:95%,end
We could say sassy.

00:14:00.239 --> 00:14:02.975 line:95%,end
It is still too much for their age.

00:14:03.042 --> 00:14:05.778 line:95%,end
And she'll be with 800 other kids
that look the same way.

00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:07.413 line:95%,end
It's just embarrassing for our daughters

00:14:07.479 --> 00:14:09.048 line:95%,end
<i>to be up there dressed like that.</i>

00:14:09.114 --> 00:14:10.549 line:95%,end
They look like prosti-tots.

00:14:10.616 --> 00:14:12.384 line:95%,end
How would your dad feel
about that that costume?

00:14:12.451 --> 00:14:14.119 line:95%,end
ABBY: You know what?
Until he's here painting

00:14:14.186 --> 00:14:15.721 line:95%,end
and working and cleaning,
he doesn't get a say.

00:14:17.423 --> 00:14:18.524 line:95%,end
<i>If you don't like what I'm doing,</i>

00:14:19.458 --> 00:14:21.293 line:95%,end
go open your own studio.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.662 line:95%,end
These moms come to me
because of my credentials

00:14:23.729 --> 00:14:25.831 line:95%,end
and, of course, my success rate.

00:14:25.898 --> 00:14:27.900 line:95%,end
But then they want to tell me
how to do my business.

00:14:27.967 --> 00:14:29.168 line:95%,end
Not gonna happen.

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:33.072 line:95%,end
<i>Number nine.</i>

00:14:33.472 --> 00:14:35.207 line:95%,end
Kelly was my student many years ago.

00:14:35.274 --> 00:14:37.142 line:95%,end
<i>She was in the original</i>
<i>Abby Lee Dance Company</i>

00:14:37.209 --> 00:14:38.444 line:95%,end
when I was 14 years old.

00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:40.312 line:95%,end
Kelly knows me.

00:14:40.379 --> 00:14:43.515 line:95%,end
She knows that I have
her children's best interests in mind.

00:14:43.582 --> 00:14:46.886 line:95%,end
I thought it would be a positive
experience to sit the moms down

00:14:46.952 --> 00:14:50.356 line:95%,end
<i>and kind of critique</i>
<i>their kids one at a time, but no.</i>

00:14:50.422 --> 00:14:52.124 line:95%,end
<i>Kelly had to go off the deep end.</i>

00:14:52.191 --> 00:14:54.059 line:95%,end
Here. Check it out yourself.

00:14:54.126 --> 00:14:55.194 line:95%,end
Brooke.

00:14:56.295 --> 00:14:58.764 line:95%,end
I am disappointed in the group routines

00:14:58.831 --> 00:14:59.999 line:95%,end
with the ability to comprehend.

00:15:00.065 --> 00:15:01.333 line:95%,end
You saw it yesterday.

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.936 line:95%,end
If I was their mother,
I would have crawled into a hole.

00:15:04.536 --> 00:15:09.074 line:95%,end
She's 13 years old
and was not picking up quickly.

00:15:09.141 --> 00:15:10.075 line:95%,end
They're slow.

00:15:10.142 --> 00:15:11.644 line:95%,end
They don't pick up quick.

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:13.712 line:95%,end
KELLY: Walk through it
step-by-step with them.

00:15:13.779 --> 00:15:15.948 line:95%,end
We're not trying to be Maddie and Chloe.

00:15:16.015 --> 00:15:17.650 line:95%,end
Neither one of my kids want to be them.

00:15:17.716 --> 00:15:19.585 line:95%,end
But why do you want
your kids to be mediocre?

00:15:19.652 --> 00:15:21.687 line:95%,end
Because that's the way my kids are.

00:15:21.754 --> 00:15:25.190 line:95%,end
-And I love them the way they are, Abby.
-I disagree. I disagree.

00:15:25.257 --> 00:15:27.259 line:95%,end
If they're not number one, we don't care.

00:15:27.326 --> 00:15:28.827 line:95%,end
They're my kids. I love them.

00:15:28.894 --> 00:15:30.596 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>I just don't get Kelly.</i>

00:15:30.663 --> 00:15:31.530 line:95%,end
But you know what?

00:15:31.597 --> 00:15:33.632 line:95%,end
Smack their heads together, wake them up,

00:15:33.699 --> 00:15:36.135 line:95%,end
tell them to get on the ball,
quit playing around,

00:15:36.201 --> 00:15:38.337 line:95%,end
invest in this like it's their future.

00:15:38.404 --> 00:15:39.571 line:95%,end
<i>This is real life.</i>

00:15:39.638 --> 00:15:42.675 line:95%,end
You have talented, beautiful children.

00:15:42.741 --> 00:15:44.410 line:95%,end
Make them own it.

00:15:44.476 --> 00:15:46.178 line:95%,end
<i>Quit saying they can be mediocre.</i>

00:15:46.245 --> 00:15:47.246 line:95%,end
You don't mean that.

00:15:47.313 --> 00:15:48.948 line:95%,end
Who wants a mediocre kid?

00:15:49.014 --> 00:15:50.049 line:95%,end
I want more.

00:15:50.115 --> 00:15:51.216 line:95%,end
I want more.

00:15:51.283 --> 00:15:52.885 line:95%,end
I want more. I want more.

00:15:52.952 --> 00:15:55.921 line:95%,end
KELLY: 12 hours a day a dance
and eight hours a day at school.

00:15:55.988 --> 00:15:56.956 line:95%,end
I mean, my God.

00:15:57.022 --> 00:15:58.357 line:95%,end
They're kids.

00:15:58.424 --> 00:15:59.525 line:95%,end
And there's another kid somewhere else

00:15:59.591 --> 00:16:00.626 line:95%,end
-working 14 hours.
-I'm not gonna have my kid

00:16:00.693 --> 00:16:03.295 line:95%,end
have a nervous breakdown
because you want them to be the best.

00:16:03.362 --> 00:16:05.097 line:95%,end
Yeah, but your kid just won another title.

00:16:06.065 --> 00:16:07.900 line:95%,end
KELLY: Ab, would you like her crown back?

00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:09.101 line:95%,end
Because you can have it.

00:16:09.668 --> 00:16:12.037 line:95%,end
-We'll have to talk about that.
-Because she take the crown

00:16:12.104 --> 00:16:14.273 line:95%,end
and shove it up your ass
cause we don't want it.


00:16:17.743 --> 00:16:21.747 line:5%,start
ABBY: Our number eight moment
is all about one mom whose sass,

00:16:21.814 --> 00:16:23.649 line:95%,end
<i>attitude, and bizarre behavior</i>

00:16:23.716 --> 00:16:25.884 line:95%,end
has kept us guessing the entire season.

00:16:26.352 --> 00:16:29.621 line:95%,end
<i>It's Miss Candy Apple herself, Cathy.</i>

00:16:30.255 --> 00:16:32.958 line:95%,end
<i>The number eight most outrageous moment.</i>

00:16:33.492 --> 00:16:35.394 line:95%,end
The dance industry
is like any other business.

00:16:35.461 --> 00:16:37.663 line:95%,end
<i>You don't have to get along</i>
<i>with everybody.</i>

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:38.764 line:95%,end
<i>You don't have to like everybody.</i>

00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:40.399 line:95%,end
But when push comes to shove,

00:16:40.466 --> 00:16:42.601 line:95%,end
you're a team
and you need to work together.

00:16:42.668 --> 00:16:44.370 line:95%,end
Kelly needed a costume for Brooke.

00:16:44.436 --> 00:16:46.538 line:95%,end
<i>The costume came in it was awful.</i>

00:16:46.605 --> 00:16:47.873 line:95%,end
<i>I didn't want her to wear it.</i>

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:51.777 line:95%,end
<i>It was my suggestion</i>
<i>that she borrow Vivian's costume</i>

00:16:51.844 --> 00:16:55.047 line:95%,end
that I drew,
that I sketched, that I had made,

00:16:55.114 --> 00:16:56.181 line:95%,end
that I paid for.

00:16:56.248 --> 00:16:58.217 line:95%,end
<i>She put it on. It was all fine.</i>

00:16:58.283 --> 00:17:00.652 line:95%,end
<i>Cathy played a really dirty trick on her</i>

00:17:00.719 --> 00:17:03.989 line:95%,end
<i>and asked for it back</i>
<i>right before she went onstage.</i>

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:06.225 line:95%,end
So it played with Brooke's psyche,

00:17:06.291 --> 00:17:07.993 line:95%,end
it played with her emotions,

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:11.063 line:95%,end
and it was really
a nasty thing to do to a kid.

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:12.331 line:95%,end
Here, take a look.

00:17:12.831 --> 00:17:14.266 line:95%,end
WOMAN: Where is

00:17:14.767 --> 00:17:15.768 line:95%,end
Brooke's costume?

00:17:15.834 --> 00:17:17.469 line:95%,end
Ew.

00:17:17.536 --> 00:17:18.904 line:95%,end
Brooke's costume is awful.

00:17:18.971 --> 00:17:20.672 line:95%,end
<i>It was hot pink</i>

00:17:20.739 --> 00:17:24.643 line:95%,end
and it had red polka dots on it
that were stickers.

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:26.545 line:95%,end
It was just terrible.

00:17:26.612 --> 00:17:28.781 line:95%,end
I don't know how we're gonna
come up with another costume,

00:17:28.847 --> 00:17:31.050 line:95%,end
but Brooke is not wearing
this costume onstage.

00:17:31.116 --> 00:17:32.484 line:95%,end
That is just ugly.

00:17:32.951 --> 00:17:34.286 line:95%,end
-Does it look like 13 to 15 age?
-CATHY: No.

00:17:34.353 --> 00:17:36.255 line:5%,start
She looks like Pennywise the Clown.

00:17:37.222 --> 00:17:39.625 line:95%,end
(indistinct chatter)

00:17:39.691 --> 00:17:40.959 line:95%,end
ABBY: Do you mind if she tries it on?

00:17:41.026 --> 00:17:43.328 line:95%,end
(indistinct chatter)

00:17:47.166 --> 00:17:48.934 line:95%,end
CATHY: <i>Brooke gets handed her costume.</i>

00:17:49.001 --> 00:17:52.404 line:95%,end
It is probably the ugliest costume
I have ever seen.

00:17:52.471 --> 00:17:56.175 line:95%,end
<i>And all eyes fall on Vivi's top.</i>

00:17:56.241 --> 00:18:00.345 line:95%,end
And all of the sudden,
Brooke is now wearing Vivi's top.

00:18:01.246 --> 00:18:02.481 line:95%,end
I like the top.

00:18:02.981 --> 00:18:05.851 line:95%,end
Vivi finally gets a costume

00:18:05.918 --> 00:18:08.187 line:95%,end
that is a custom-made costume,

00:18:08.253 --> 00:18:09.321 line:95%,end
<i>and we have to now share.</i>

00:18:09.388 --> 00:18:10.422 line:95%,end
I'm not happy.

00:18:10.489 --> 00:18:13.292 line:95%,end
CATHY: I... I thought about it
and I really don't want

00:18:13.358 --> 00:18:15.727 line:95%,end
Paige... Paige? What's your kid's name?

00:18:15.794 --> 00:18:16.829 line:95%,end
Move, please.

00:18:16.895 --> 00:18:18.797 line:95%,end
I don't want Brooke wearing the costume.

00:18:19.865 --> 00:18:22.034 line:95%,end
I'm sorry, I just... I thought about it...

00:18:22.101 --> 00:18:25.204 line:95%,end
and I saw you over here floundering
the way you were sewing that...

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:27.539 line:95%,end
and it's not going to look
the same tomorrow and...

00:18:27.606 --> 00:18:29.274 line:95%,end
we just need to come up
with something else.

00:18:29.341 --> 00:18:31.310 line:95%,end
KELLY: Whatever.
Brooke, take the costume off.

00:18:31.877 --> 00:18:34.113 line:95%,end
You know what, Cathy?
If you don't want to be part of our group,

00:18:34.179 --> 00:18:35.714 line:95%,end
don't come to our studio.

00:18:35.781 --> 00:18:36.949 line:95%,end
CATHY: Kelly, it has nothing to do with--

00:18:37.015 --> 00:18:38.450 line:95%,end
-Get the costume off. Go.
-CATHY: It was nothing to do with--

00:18:38.517 --> 00:18:40.919 line:95%,end
My daughter is dancing in three minutes
and you're taking

00:18:40.986 --> 00:18:41.820 line:95%,end
-the costume off of her back.
-Well, I'm sorry.

00:18:41.887 --> 00:18:43.055 line:95%,end
I know. And it's ridiculous

00:18:43.122 --> 00:18:45.157 line:95%,end
-that you guys aren't prepared.
-Whatever, Cathy.

00:18:45.224 --> 00:18:46.225 line:95%,end
Come here.

00:18:46.992 --> 00:18:47.993 line:95%,end
You know what? Come out here, Kelly.

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:49.394 line:95%,end

coming up to me three numbers

CATHY: It's ridiculous.

00:19:02.007 --> 00:19:04.409 line:95%,end
I never saw
such disorganization in all my life.

00:19:04.476 --> 00:19:07.212 line:95%,end
Yeah, well it isn't
my disorganization, is it?

00:19:07.279 --> 00:19:08.881 line:95%,end
-But you'll hurt my daughter.
-CATHY: You know what?

00:19:08.947 --> 00:19:10.182 line:95%,end
I think that from now on,

00:19:10.249 --> 00:19:12.518 line:95%,end
when Abby insists
on ridiculousness like this,

00:19:12.584 --> 00:19:13.886 line:95%,end
that you stand up for yourself.

00:19:13.952 --> 00:19:16.421 line:95%,end
KELLY: Cathy is definitely
not a team player.

You're doing it to show Abby something.

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:22.628 line:95%,end
-No, I'm not.
-And my daughter gets hurt.

00:19:22.694 --> 00:19:23.562 line:95%,end
I'm not doing it to show Abby anything.

00:19:23.629 --> 00:19:25.164 line:95%,end
-It's just that I haven't come...
-Whatever, Cathy.

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:26.665 line:95%,end
-...and asked you for costume.
-KELLY: Cathy, just...

00:19:26.732 --> 00:19:28.066 line:95%,end
-CATHY: How did we even--
-No, but everybody else.

00:19:28.133 --> 00:19:30.802 line:95%,end
-That's what we do as a group, Cathy.
-CATHY: How did we even come to that?

KELLY: <i>We always share costumes.</i>

00:19:32.804 --> 00:19:34.072 line:95%,end
I mean, that's what a group is about.

00:19:34.139 --> 00:19:35.541 line:95%,end
CATHY: They haven't had a new costume
where everybody else (indistinct)

00:19:35.607 --> 00:19:37.209 line:95%,end
Well, whatever.
Well, why didn't you come to me earlier?

00:19:37.276 --> 00:19:38.110 line:95%,end
How many new costumes--

00:19:38.177 --> 00:19:40.579 line:95%,end
So I could've got my costume from Maddie?

00:19:40.646 --> 00:19:42.080 line:95%,end
Kelly, how many new costumes have you had?

00:19:42.147 --> 00:19:43.749 line:95%,end
-It doesn't matter.
-Go back to your studio.

00:19:43.815 --> 00:19:45.918 line:95%,end
CATHY: You know what? I'm not.
I'm here to stay.

-So like it.

00:19:47.352 --> 00:19:48.587 line:95%,end
-KELLY: Yeah. I don't.
-CATHY: Okay?

00:19:48.654 --> 00:19:50.355 line:95%,end

00:19:50.422 --> 00:19:52.024 line:95%,end
That's your problem.

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:53.091 line:95%,end
You need to like it.

00:19:53.158 --> 00:19:55.961 line:95%,end
Well, here's your costume,
and you can sew it yourself.

00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:01.233 line:95%,end

No. My daughter is gonna dance

00:20:14.313 --> 00:20:16.415 line:95%,end

of your kids from your studio

00:20:16.481 --> 00:20:18.584 line:95%,end
out there dancing against her
because I can guarantee you

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:20.252 line:95%,end
she will beat their ass

00:20:23.355 --> 00:20:24.389 line:95%,end
-Let's go.
-I doubt it.

00:20:24.456 --> 00:20:26.725 line:95%,end
Your kids all have sickle feet

-Yeah. Yeah, Cathy. Sure.

00:20:28.627 --> 00:20:30.462 line:95%,end
...sickle feet, sickle feet,
and they all have them.

00:20:30.529 --> 00:20:32.798 line:95%,end
Let's bring your studio

Bring it on.

When I see my students
make mistakes on stage,

00:20:42.474 --> 00:20:46.011 line:95%,end

00:20:48.247 --> 00:20:49.982 line:95%,end

That hasn't happened to me in 25 years.

00:21:43.068 --> 00:21:44.670 line:95%,end

You should remain on stage

ABBY: It was humiliating for me
as a teacher, number one.

00:22:12.197 --> 00:22:13.999 line:95%,end
And number two, she should be humiliated.

<i>Number six.</i>

CATHY: <i>This is not possible for us.</i>

We did not bargain
for this kind of travel.

I've got committed
things happening at home

00:22:50.369 --> 00:22:52.170 line:95%,end

00:22:52.237 --> 00:22:53.138 line:95%,end

Okay.

We're getting off the party train.

We just are not gonna be able
to accommodate this.

00:23:04.349 --> 00:23:06.251 line:95%,end
And there's nobody--like,
your mom can't just bring her, or?

No, no.

00:23:07.352 --> 00:23:10.355 line:95%,end
And you know that Vivi's not gonna go
with anybody but me anyhow.

00:23:10.422 --> 00:23:11.456 line:95%,end
I thought maybe your mom.

00:23:11.523 --> 00:23:13.024 line:95%,end
Yeah, no. She's not gonna do that.

00:23:14.459 --> 00:23:15.427 line:95%,end
Just not gonna work for us.

You know that.

00:23:19.064 --> 00:23:20.799 line:95%,end
CATHY: Yeah. Even dance teachers.

00:23:21.833 --> 00:23:23.668 line:95%,end
If I'm gonna go on tour,

00:23:23.735 --> 00:23:25.771 line:95%,end
I'm gonna go on tour with my students

00:23:25.837 --> 00:23:27.372 line:95%,end
who are winning platinums.

00:23:27.439 --> 00:23:29.040 line:95%,end
I respect you as a teacher.

00:23:29.107 --> 00:23:30.242 line:95%,end
I think you're wonderful.

00:23:30.308 --> 00:23:31.576 line:95%,end

Well, you're a quitter.

00:23:33.478 --> 00:23:34.713 line:95%,end
Whatever.

00:23:37.215 --> 00:23:40.118 line:95%,end
It's the people that you just bend over
backwards for,

00:23:40.185 --> 00:23:42.888 line:95%,end
you give the opportunity to,
you don't stick to your rules,

00:23:42.954 --> 00:23:44.556 line:95%,end

Maybe I can teach you guys The Death Drop.

00:25:29.761 --> 00:25:31.029 line:95%,end
Yeah!

00:25:31.096 --> 00:25:32.831 line:95%,end
The Death Drop really is safe.

00:25:32.898 --> 00:25:34.399 line:95%,end
You're not falling on your back.

00:25:34.466 --> 00:25:35.934 line:95%,end
But okay, so here we go.

00:25:36.001 --> 00:25:38.169 line:95%,end
My paws, da, da, da, da da.

00:25:38.236 --> 00:25:39.704 line:95%,end
My paws.

00:25:39.771 --> 00:25:40.839 line:95%,end
Just like that.

00:25:40.906 --> 00:25:42.474 line:95%,end
And that's the move, okay?

00:25:42.541 --> 00:25:45.010 line:95%,end
So Nia, on the ending,

00:25:45.076 --> 00:25:46.811 line:95%,end
we're gonna put that trick in there, okay?

00:25:46.878 --> 00:25:51.082 line:95%,end
And let me tell you something,
the crowd is going to go wild.

00:25:51.149 --> 00:25:52.250 line:95%,end
So we're gonna come up.

00:25:52.317 --> 00:25:55.253 line:95%,end
Then you'll go,
then your hip, hip, hip, hip.

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:57.422 line:95%,end
And then wipe.

00:25:58.557 --> 00:26:00.659 line:95%,end
And then Death Drop. Pow.

00:26:02.127 --> 00:26:03.194 line:95%,end
Yeah!

00:26:03.261 --> 00:26:05.230 line:95%,end
You feel good? You're ready. I know you.

00:26:05.297 --> 00:26:07.098 line:95%,end
HOLLY: <i>I'm like, oh, my gosh.</i>

00:26:07.165 --> 00:26:09.935 line:95%,end
<i>To be honest with you,</i>
<i>my stomach is in knots.</i>

00:26:10.001 --> 00:26:11.069 line:95%,end
<i>I have a lump in my throat.</i>

00:26:11.136 --> 00:26:12.871 line:95%,end
<i>I'm not sure Nia could pull that off.</i>

00:26:14.639 --> 00:26:17.375 line:95%,end
(pop music playing)

00:26:21.613 --> 00:26:24.015 line:95%,end
(cheering)

00:26:24.516 --> 00:26:26.551 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>Next up, number four.</i>

00:26:26.952 --> 00:26:29.888 line:95%,end
Christi's daughter Chloe
is a beautiful dancer.

00:26:29.955 --> 00:26:31.623 line:95%,end
<i>The child holds two titles.</i>

00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:33.525 line:95%,end
<i>I don't know what more the woman wants.</i>

00:26:33.592 --> 00:26:36.661 line:95%,end
<i>But when she knocked</i>
<i>on my hotel room door unannounced</i>

00:26:36.728 --> 00:26:39.064 line:95%,end
and wanted to interrupt my private time,

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:40.165 line:95%,end
I let her have it.

00:26:41.433 --> 00:26:44.536 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Chloe told me that Abby
has been screaming in her face

00:26:44.603 --> 00:26:48.506 line:95%,end
and belittling her
and talking to her the way she has--

00:26:49.307 --> 00:26:51.343 line:95%,end
I will not put up with this anymore.

00:26:51.409 --> 00:26:52.477 line:95%,end
I can't. I can't.

00:26:52.544 --> 00:26:56.081 line:95%,end
It is my duty as Chloe's mother
to put an end to it.

00:26:58.917 --> 00:27:00.919 line:95%,end
There's someone at my door. Hang on.

00:27:01.853 --> 00:27:04.322 line:95%,end
Okay. All right. Well, let me...

00:27:06.358 --> 00:27:07.258 line:95%,end
I need to talk to you.

00:27:07.325 --> 00:27:09.361 line:95%,end
This is rude again. Come on.

00:27:09.427 --> 00:27:10.662 line:95%,end
We're gonna talk about rude.

00:27:10.729 --> 00:27:14.399 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>Christi is rude,</i>
<i>arrogant, and she's clueless.</i>

00:27:14.466 --> 00:27:15.834 line:95%,end
<i>You're not paying me for this time.</i>

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:17.302 line:95%,end
You owe me this time.

00:27:17.369 --> 00:27:19.938 line:95%,end
I owe you nothing.

00:27:20.005 --> 00:27:22.540 line:95%,end
You're incredibly rude to my daughter.

00:27:22.607 --> 00:27:25.477 line:95%,end
All I'm asking you for
is to treat my daughter

00:27:25.543 --> 00:27:27.045 line:95%,end
with a little bit of respect.

00:27:27.112 --> 00:27:29.314 line:95%,end
I do every single time.


00:27:29.381 --> 00:27:32.684 line:95%,end
When you are in the picture,
your child looks at you.

00:27:32.751 --> 00:27:34.886 line:95%,end
-Because she's afraid of you.
-ABBY: She's like this.

00:27:34.953 --> 00:27:36.988 line:95%,end
You ask her a question,
she goes like this.

00:27:37.055 --> 00:27:39.991 line:95%,end
<i>It's like she's competing with you and me</i>

00:27:40.058 --> 00:27:41.292 line:95%,end
<i>and you and me and you and me.</i>

00:27:41.359 --> 00:27:42.961 line:95%,end
She is a beautiful dancer.

00:27:43.028 --> 00:27:44.696 line:95%,end
She's a great kid.

00:27:44.763 --> 00:27:47.032 line:95%,end
But she looks at you with one eye.

00:27:47.098 --> 00:27:49.200 line:95%,end
Like this. Scared to death to fail.

00:27:49.668 --> 00:27:51.336 line:95%,end
Oh, my God. All she does is fail.

00:27:51.403 --> 00:27:53.038 line:95%,end
All you do is set her up to fail.

00:27:53.104 --> 00:27:55.040 line:95%,end
-You--
-She's holding two national titles.

00:27:55.106 --> 00:27:56.941 line:95%,end
You went up--you went backstage

00:27:57.008 --> 00:27:59.277 line:95%,end
before something and said, be like Maddie.

00:27:59.344 --> 00:28:01.312 line:95%,end
Who does that to a kid?

00:28:01.379 --> 00:28:02.747 line:95%,end
Deny it all you want.

00:28:02.814 --> 00:28:04.749 line:95%,end
-Deny it all you want.
-Why wouldn't you want to be like Maddie?

00:28:04.816 --> 00:28:05.784 line:95%,end
I want to be like Maddie.

00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:07.952 line:95%,end
Because Chloe
doesn't need to be like Maddie.

00:28:08.019 --> 00:28:09.988 line:95%,end
Chloe is Chloe and that is good enough.

00:28:10.055 --> 00:28:11.690 line:95%,end
-For who?
-CHRISTI: For her.

00:28:11.756 --> 00:28:13.591 line:95%,end
-Not for you.
-Yes, it is.

00:28:13.658 --> 00:28:15.260 line:95%,end
Then why are you
so jealous of an eight-year-old?

00:28:15.326 --> 00:28:16.528 line:95%,end
Oh, my God.

00:28:16.594 --> 00:28:18.630 line:95%,end
-You should love her unconditionally.
-CHRISTI: I do.

00:28:18.697 --> 00:28:21.032 line:95%,end
Abby, don't you dare
question my parenting.

00:28:21.966 --> 00:28:22.801 line:95%,end
I do.

00:28:24.169 --> 00:28:26.938 line:95%,end
The bottom line is Chloe's at the top
of the pyramid this week.

00:28:27.005 --> 00:28:29.708 line:95%,end
And what are your expectations for her?

00:28:30.341 --> 00:28:32.343 line:95%,end
I expect her to win, hands down.

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:35.080 line:95%,end
I expect people to be talking about Chloe.

00:28:35.146 --> 00:28:38.383 line:95%,end
-Okay.
-People should be buzzing about her.

00:28:38.883 --> 00:28:41.486 line:95%,end
I just want to leave
kind of and move forward

00:28:41.553 --> 00:28:43.121 line:95%,end
because we're obviously
kind of stuck with each other.

00:28:43.188 --> 00:28:45.290 line:95%,end
-I agree. I agree.
-I know that you're--

00:28:45.356 --> 00:28:47.759 line:95%,end
you've said it point blank.
You don't like me.

00:28:47.826 --> 00:28:49.194 line:95%,end
I said I can't stand you.

00:28:50.628 --> 00:28:53.331 line:95%,end
I'm not as bitchy as I come across.

00:28:53.398 --> 00:28:54.866 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>I saw a more human side of Christi.</i>

00:28:54.933 --> 00:28:56.067 line:95%,end
She broke down a little bit.

00:28:56.134 --> 00:28:58.103 line:95%,end
<i>I saw her be a little bit more emotional.</i>

00:28:58.169 --> 00:29:00.038 line:95%,end
However, I hope I got through to her

00:29:00.105 --> 00:29:02.807 line:95%,end
that I do have Chloe's best interest
at heart,

00:29:02.874 --> 00:29:04.642 line:95%,end
she just needs to let me do my job.

00:29:06.611 --> 00:29:07.746 line:95%,end
<i>Number three.</i>

00:29:08.346 --> 00:29:11.116 line:95%,end
Cathy may be quirky and even fun at times,

00:29:11.182 --> 00:29:13.685 line:95%,end
but she just didn't have
what it takes to be on my team.

00:29:13.752 --> 00:29:16.154 line:95%,end
So she went back
to Candy Apple Dance Center,

00:29:16.221 --> 00:29:17.555 line:95%,end
<i>grabbed a bunch of her kids,</i>

00:29:17.622 --> 00:29:19.724 line:95%,end
<i>and showed up to compete against me.</i>

00:29:19.791 --> 00:29:21.326 line:95%,end
<i>Did she really think</i>

00:29:21.392 --> 00:29:25.630 line:95%,end
<i>that she was gonna come to L.A.</i>
<i>on my turf and beat me?</i>

00:29:26.097 --> 00:29:27.132 line:95%,end
I don't think so.

00:29:27.198 --> 00:29:28.266 line:95%,end
Check it out.

00:29:29.634 --> 00:29:31.202 line:95%,end
Surprise!

00:29:33.371 --> 00:29:35.140 line:95%,end
-CATHY: Hi.
-WOMAN: Hello.

00:29:36.541 --> 00:29:38.376 line:95%,end
-CATHY: Hi, everybody.
-What are you doing here?

00:29:38.443 --> 00:29:39.811 line:95%,end
Um, I have something for you.

00:29:39.878 --> 00:29:41.412 line:95%,end
ABBY: Are you, like, here in the hotel?

00:29:41.479 --> 00:29:43.148 line:95%,end
-Are you at the convention?
-CATHY: I am here at the hotel.

00:29:43.214 --> 00:29:44.549 line:95%,end
I don't like the hotel.

00:29:44.616 --> 00:29:47.485 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>Cathy walks into</i>
<i>our dressing room out of nowhere.</i>

00:29:47.552 --> 00:29:49.621 line:95%,end
Like, thin air. She shows up.

00:29:49.687 --> 00:29:51.289 line:95%,end
<i>Suddenly, she's in L.A.</i>

00:29:51.356 --> 00:29:53.558 line:95%,end
CATHY: I do want to introduce you
to somebody.

00:29:54.058 --> 00:29:54.959 line:95%,end
This is Justice.

00:29:55.894 --> 00:29:58.563 line:95%,end
Vivi and Justice
are gonna be doing a duo together,

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:01.833 line:95%,end
and I think Mackenzie and Nia,

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:04.002 line:95%,end
you guys are gonna be
competing against them.

00:30:04.435 --> 00:30:06.004 line:95%,end
So that should be pretty interesting.

00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:07.939 line:95%,end
HOLLY: She was here to challenge us

00:30:08.006 --> 00:30:11.209 line:95%,end
and to basically
put our noses in and, like,

00:30:11.276 --> 00:30:12.944 line:95%,end
my kids will do better than you.

00:30:13.011 --> 00:30:14.779 line:95%,end
I'm here because I remember
a certain somebody

00:30:14.846 --> 00:30:17.816 line:95%,end
told me to bring it on.
So consider it brought.

00:30:17.882 --> 00:30:20.218 line:95%,end
Let's bring your studio
to a competition we go to.

00:30:20.285 --> 00:30:21.786 line:95%,end
You know what? Bring it on, babe.
Bring it on.

00:30:21.853 --> 00:30:23.321 line:95%,end
-KELLY: Bring it on, Cathy.
-CATHY: Bring it on.

00:30:23.388 --> 00:30:26.791 line:95%,end
We'd never done it before,
so we wanted to try it and, you know,

00:30:26.858 --> 00:30:30.295 line:95%,end
just kind of kick around a couple
of new pieces of choreography.

00:30:30.361 --> 00:30:34.399 line:95%,end
Fresh choreography,
not old, boring, dated choreography.

00:30:34.465 --> 00:30:36.901 line:95%,end
I, on the other hand,
don't have the philosophy

00:30:36.968 --> 00:30:39.938 line:95%,end
of just keep using the same
tired stuff because it works.

00:30:41.372 --> 00:30:43.341 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>Then she started on my choreography.</i>

00:30:44.375 --> 00:30:46.578 line:95%,end
Who does that to another professional?

00:30:46.644 --> 00:30:48.713 line:95%,end
<i>Her daughter didn't know</i>
<i>her right for from her left.</i>

00:30:49.214 --> 00:30:51.850 line:95%,end
She could do a heel stretch
holding her leg the wrong way. That's it.

00:30:51.916 --> 00:30:54.586 line:95%,end
I have kids working all over the place.

00:30:54.652 --> 00:30:56.855 line:95%,end
-I can walk into any--
-And so we've heard.

00:30:56.921 --> 00:30:58.056 line:95%,end
-And so we've heard.
-Yes.

00:30:58.122 --> 00:30:59.591 line:95%,end
And I have kids that are working, too.

00:30:59.657 --> 00:31:01.693 line:95%,end
Name them
because I've never heard of one of them.

00:31:01.759 --> 00:31:04.295 line:95%,end
Well, I have Loris
who is in New York City.

00:31:04.362 --> 00:31:05.463 line:95%,end
-Doing what? What show?
-I have Matt--

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:07.565 line:95%,end
-Tell me what Broadway show she's in.
-She's not in a Broadway show.

00:31:07.632 --> 00:31:08.933 line:95%,end
Failure.


00:31:10.034 --> 00:31:11.402 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>We are near the top of the pyramid</i>

00:31:11.469 --> 00:31:15.673 line:95%,end
<i>with our two most outrageous moments</i>
<i>from season one of Dance Moms.</i>

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:18.943 line:5%,start
And as you may have guessed,
there are tears, fights,

00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:20.645 line:95%,end
<i>and a whole lot of crazy.</i>

00:31:20.712 --> 00:31:23.648 line:95%,end
<i>Here's the number two</i>
<i>most outrageous moment.</i>

00:31:23.715 --> 00:31:25.083 line:95%,end
Let's face it.

00:31:25.149 --> 00:31:27.151 line:95%,end
All of the dance moms are a little crazy.

00:31:27.218 --> 00:31:29.520 line:95%,end
KELLY: (indistinct) I get it!

00:31:29.587 --> 00:31:32.390 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>But nothing compares to Dawn.</i>

00:31:32.457 --> 00:31:34.959 line:95%,end
Check out this sinister minister.

00:31:38.062 --> 00:31:40.999 line:95%,end
Dawn's daughter was called
into my class for a routine

00:31:41.065 --> 00:31:42.734 line:95%,end
that she was picked special for.

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:44.869 line:95%,end
And she had socks and a t-shirt on.

00:31:45.904 --> 00:31:47.772 line:95%,end
I don't care if you take them,
I'm going in to kill it.

00:31:47.839 --> 00:31:49.474 line:95%,end
ABBY: They were to wear tights
and a leotard.

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:51.709 line:95%,end
I made two other children
change their clothes

00:31:52.176 --> 00:31:53.311 line:95%,end
because it's acro.

00:31:53.378 --> 00:31:54.479 line:95%,end
We're doing a lot on our knees

00:31:54.545 --> 00:31:56.080 line:95%,end
and they have to be in their bare feet.

00:31:58.816 --> 00:32:00.418 line:95%,end
May I speak to you a minute?

00:32:01.052 --> 00:32:02.587 line:95%,end
No, I'm in rehearsal.

00:32:03.121 --> 00:32:04.355 line:95%,end
DAWN: I want to speak to you.

00:32:04.422 --> 00:32:05.990 line:95%,end
You don't throw my kid out of class.

00:32:06.057 --> 00:32:07.458 line:95%,end
I paid for class.

00:32:07.525 --> 00:32:09.127 line:95%,end
ABBY: She's not dressed appropriately.

00:32:09.193 --> 00:32:12.931 line:95%,end
DAWN: I'm looking at every single kid
out here, Abby.

00:32:12.997 --> 00:32:16.200 line:95%,end
They all look like children.

00:32:16.267 --> 00:32:19.637 line:95%,end
Isn't that crazy
that children look like children?

00:32:19.704 --> 00:32:21.973 line:95%,end
She's dressed appropriately.

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:24.008 line:95%,end
ABBY: You're a minister, act like one.

00:32:24.075 --> 00:32:25.443 line:95%,end
Yes, I am a minister.

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:28.246 line:95%,end
Let's play the Bible game, Abby.

00:32:28.313 --> 00:32:32.917 line:95%,end
When Jesus saw things
that were wrong, he went after it.

00:32:32.984 --> 00:32:34.319 line:95%,end
And I'll tell you what.

00:32:34.385 --> 00:32:36.220 line:95%,end
You're not gonna do this to my kid.

00:32:36.287 --> 00:32:37.655 line:95%,end
Out of the room. Out.

00:32:37.722 --> 00:32:39.424 line:95%,end
Out. Reagan, goodbye.

00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:41.659 line:95%,end
-Out. Out.
-DAWN: You ain't throwing her out.

00:32:41.726 --> 00:32:43.361 line:95%,end
Oh, yes, I am. And you with her.

00:32:43.428 --> 00:32:44.295 line:95%,end
-Go.
-No, you're not.

00:32:44.362 --> 00:32:45.530 line:95%,end
Yes.

00:32:45.596 --> 00:32:47.265 line:95%,end
Every week, we put the trash out.

00:32:47.332 --> 00:32:48.666 line:95%,end
Go.

00:32:48.733 --> 00:32:50.635 line:95%,end
Then take yourself out

00:32:50.702 --> 00:32:53.504 line:95%,end
because you're the biggest
piece of trash there is.

00:32:53.571 --> 00:32:56.407 line:95%,end
ABBY: You can not take
acrobatic class in socks.

00:32:58.109 --> 00:33:00.345 line:95%,end
I told you to close the (indistinct)
your two-piece costume.

00:33:00.411 --> 00:33:01.646 line:95%,end
There's a big difference.

00:33:01.713 --> 00:33:03.081 line:95%,end
How can you remember that

00:33:03.147 --> 00:33:05.016 line:95%,end
and you can't remember
to turn your feet out?

00:33:05.083 --> 00:33:06.050 line:95%,end
Huh?

00:33:06.117 --> 00:33:07.118 line:95%,end
That's pathetic.

00:33:07.185 --> 00:33:09.253 line:95%,end
Go somewhere else. Take your money,

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:11.122 line:95%,end
take your kid, take your socks,

00:33:11.189 --> 00:33:12.290 line:95%,end
find another school.

00:33:12.357 --> 00:33:15.860 line:95%,end
Does it not hit in your heart
that maybe you're wrong?

00:33:15.927 --> 00:33:17.628 line:95%,end
-No.
-Do you not get it?

00:33:17.695 --> 00:33:19.430 line:95%,end
I don't get it. I know I'm right.

00:33:19.497 --> 00:33:20.865 line:95%,end
-I'm--
-Why are you right?

00:33:20.932 --> 00:33:22.500 line:95%,end
-It's my building.
-Why can't--

00:33:22.567 --> 00:33:23.835 line:95%,end
-My name's on the front.
-So what?

00:33:23.901 --> 00:33:26.637 line:95%,end
You keep telling her how stupid she is.

00:33:26.704 --> 00:33:29.841 line:95%,end
-She's not stupid. She just can't read.
-DAWN: It's so--you now--

00:33:29.907 --> 00:33:32.510 line:95%,end
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

00:33:32.577 --> 00:33:33.678 line:95%,end
Oh.

00:33:33.745 --> 00:33:35.513 line:95%,end
So you're saying I'm stupid?

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:36.481 line:95%,end
-Well--
-Are you?

00:33:36.547 --> 00:33:37.648 line:95%,end
Ah! Quit chasing me.

00:33:37.715 --> 00:33:40.385 line:95%,end
I have more education
than you will ever have.

00:33:40.451 --> 00:33:44.422 line:95%,end
Than you will ever have
because I went to school.

00:33:44.489 --> 00:33:47.158 line:95%,end
-Unfortunately, you didn't.
-May I have your phone?

00:33:47.225 --> 00:33:48.493 line:95%,end
Call the police.

00:33:48.559 --> 00:33:50.261 line:95%,end
Go for it.

00:33:50.328 --> 00:33:51.796 line:95%,end
-I'm sorry, girls.
-DAWN: Go for it.

00:33:51.863 --> 00:33:53.631 line:95%,end
There's a psycho in every batch.

00:33:53.698 --> 00:33:54.565 line:95%,end
A psycho.

00:33:54.632 --> 00:33:56.701 line:95%,end
Yes. Her name's Abigail Miller.

00:33:56.768 --> 00:34:01.172 line:95%,end
ABBY: Hi. I need police at 7123 Saltzburg.

00:34:01.239 --> 00:34:02.673 line:95%,end
You okay, Dawn?

00:34:03.374 --> 00:34:05.710 line:95%,end
I know, I know. I know.

00:34:05.777 --> 00:34:07.445 line:95%,end
Are you all right?

00:34:07.512 --> 00:34:10.748 line:95%,end
-No, I'm not.
-(hushes)

00:34:10.815 --> 00:34:13.751 line:95%,end
I have an, uh,
a parent that's out of control.

00:34:13.818 --> 00:34:15.920 line:95%,end
I can't stand her.

00:34:15.987 --> 00:34:17.155 line:95%,end
Pardon?

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:21.059 line:95%,end
She does not have weapons, just her mouth.

00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:22.994 line:95%,end
(siren blaring)

00:34:23.061 --> 00:34:24.562 line:95%,end
OFFICER: We just want you
to leave the property, so.

00:34:24.629 --> 00:34:26.397 line:95%,end
-Yeah. (indistinct)
-OFFICER: All right. You guys out.

00:34:26.464 --> 00:34:28.032 line:95%,end
Take your daughter somewhere else, then,

00:34:28.099 --> 00:34:29.700 line:95%,end
if you don't like the dance company here.

00:34:29.767 --> 00:34:32.203 line:95%,end
(whimsical music playing)

00:34:33.838 --> 00:34:36.774 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>On top of the pyramid, number one.</i>

00:34:37.508 --> 00:34:40.578 line:95%,end
The number one moment
is certainly one for the record books.

00:34:40.645 --> 00:34:42.346 line:95%,end
I can't believe it even happened.

00:34:43.014 --> 00:34:45.616 line:95%,end
<i>What you're about to see</i>
<i>surprised even me.</i>


00:34:45.683 --> 00:34:47.385 line:95%,end
<i>We were at Onstage New York</i>

00:34:47.452 --> 00:34:51.589 line:95%,end
<i>and we had won the overall high score</i>
<i>of the entire day</i>

00:34:51.656 --> 00:34:53.925 line:95%,end
and the Mini Critics' Choice Award.

00:34:54.625 --> 00:34:55.760 line:95%,end
It was a great day.

00:34:55.827 --> 00:34:57.328 line:95%,end
Everybody was happy.

00:34:57.395 --> 00:34:59.764 line:95%,end
And then Christi completely lost control.

00:34:59.831 --> 00:35:03.835 line:95%,end
<i>Never have I seen mothers so unbecoming.</i>

00:35:03.901 --> 00:35:05.069 line:95%,end
<i>It was ridiculous.</i>

00:35:05.136 --> 00:35:07.238 line:95%,end
<i>I don't know what Christi was thinking.</i>

00:35:07.305 --> 00:35:09.207 line:95%,end
<i>I don't know what Christi was drinking.</i>

00:35:09.273 --> 00:35:10.308 line:95%,end
But I'll tell you what.

00:35:10.374 --> 00:35:12.110 line:95%,end
She crossed the line.

00:35:12.176 --> 00:35:13.377 line:95%,end
Watch.

00:35:13.878 --> 00:35:15.580 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>I am so fed up with the BS.</i>

00:35:16.013 --> 00:35:18.649 line:95%,end
<i>No one has a chance in hell</i>
<i>of winning against Maddie.</i>

00:35:18.716 --> 00:35:19.884 line:95%,end
She has two solos.

00:35:19.951 --> 00:35:23.187 line:95%,end
She already has twice
as good of a chance as anyone else.

00:35:23.254 --> 00:35:25.022 line:95%,end
MELISSA: <i>I really don't care</i>
<i>what Christi thinks.</i>

00:35:25.089 --> 00:35:27.258 line:95%,end
<i>She would do anything</i>
<i>for her daughter to win.</i>

00:35:27.325 --> 00:35:28.726 line:95%,end
I don't do anything
for my daughter to win.

00:35:28.793 --> 00:35:30.528 line:95%,end
My daughter wins on her own.

00:35:31.262 --> 00:35:33.264 line:95%,end
ABBY: Woo-hoo!

00:35:33.331 --> 00:35:35.333 line:95%,end
Abby, I think we need to talk.

00:35:35.399 --> 00:35:36.734 line:95%,end
ABBY: No, you're not gonna ruin this day.

00:35:36.801 --> 00:35:38.136 line:95%,end
No. We need to talk, Abby.

00:35:38.202 --> 00:35:39.737 line:95%,end
In the hallway now.

00:35:39.804 --> 00:35:42.607 line:95%,end
Are you kidding? I'm a paying client
and you won't speak to me.

00:35:42.673 --> 00:35:44.575 line:95%,end
No. Nothing's worth that much money.

00:35:44.642 --> 00:35:47.245 line:95%,end
<i>I think the worst thing</i>
<i>that Christi can do</i>

00:35:47.311 --> 00:35:50.982 line:95%,end
<i>is talk about me</i>
<i>when her daughter's present.</i>

00:35:51.048 --> 00:35:53.684 line:95%,end
I could not get Chloe to trust me

00:35:53.751 --> 00:35:55.887 line:95%,end
if her mother doesn't trust me herself.

00:35:55.953 --> 00:35:57.421 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I'm so excited for you

00:35:57.488 --> 00:35:59.190 line:95%,end
-because she got the best award.
-No. We don't want to ruin

00:35:59.257 --> 00:36:01.159 line:95%,end
the waited victory.

00:36:01.225 --> 00:36:02.693 line:95%,end
-I'm not ruining today.
-No.

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:04.562 line:95%,end
-Abby. We need to go in the hallway.
-What--why is this here?

00:36:04.629 --> 00:36:06.030 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Don't be doing this in front
of my daughter, Christi.

00:36:06.097 --> 00:36:07.031 line:95%,end
Abby.

00:36:07.098 --> 00:36:09.333 line:95%,end
We can all go in the hallway
because I tried to talk to you

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:11.335 line:95%,end
-and I tried to talk to you. Personally.
-MELISSA: I'm not talking to you.

00:36:11.402 --> 00:36:12.703 line:95%,end
-Let's go in the hallway.
-Why are we doing this?

00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:14.138 line:95%,end
-I'm not going anywhere.
-ABBY LEE MILLER: The children just won.

00:36:14.205 --> 00:36:16.040 line:95%,end
-My daughter's happy.
-CHRISTI: Let's go in the hallway.

00:36:16.107 --> 00:36:18.142 line:95%,end
Do you want to talk about all the things

00:36:18.209 --> 00:36:19.844 line:95%,end
-that need to be talked about?
-Not here.

00:36:19.911 --> 00:36:21.913 line:95%,end
-Because you won't talk about it
-Not now. This is the weekend.

00:36:21.979 --> 00:36:23.447 line:95%,end
-and you won't talk about it.
-You're not paying for my time.

00:36:23.514 --> 00:36:24.649 line:95%,end
You are not paying me.

00:36:24.715 --> 00:36:25.850 line:95%,end
-You are not paying me.
-Abby, I'm not talking about it,

00:36:25.917 --> 00:36:28.452 line:95%,end
You're making my daughter cry. So shut up!

00:36:28.519 --> 00:36:30.688 line:95%,end
-Talk about what?
-And how many times has my daughter

00:36:30.755 --> 00:36:32.123 line:95%,end
beat your daughter this year?

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:34.759 line:95%,end
-Bite my ass.
-We were stacked against everybody

00:36:34.825 --> 00:36:36.727 line:95%,end
-this weekend because you did it.
-Look, don't you get it?

00:36:36.794 --> 00:36:38.496 line:95%,end
-Get out of here now.
-Let's go.

00:36:38.563 --> 00:36:39.830 line:95%,end
-Bitch.
-Let's go.

00:36:39.897 --> 00:36:41.098 line:95%,end
Amazing. Your kids feel bad,

00:36:41.165 --> 00:36:43.067 line:95%,end
but it doesn't matter
that my daughter feels bad.

00:36:43.134 --> 00:36:44.902 line:95%,end
Your daughter is holding a national title

00:36:44.969 --> 00:36:46.437 line:95%,end
and I will take it away in a minute.

00:36:46.504 --> 00:36:47.805 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Go ahead and take it away, Abby.

00:36:47.872 --> 00:36:49.040 line:95%,end

00:36:49.106 --> 00:36:50.841 line:95%,end
That's fine. Where you gonna go?

00:36:50.908 --> 00:36:53.044 line:95%,end
HOLLY: <i>I would say the fight</i>

00:36:53.110 --> 00:36:54.645 line:95%,end
<i>was incredibly embarrassing</i>

00:36:54.712 --> 00:36:56.514 line:95%,end
<i>and that could've been handled</i>
<i>behind closed doors,</i>

00:36:56.581 --> 00:36:58.082 line:95%,end
<i>definitely not in front of children.</i>

00:36:58.149 --> 00:36:59.517 line:95%,end
<i>Even with our issues,</i>

00:36:59.584 --> 00:37:02.320 line:95%,end
<i>I try to limit the things</i>
<i>I'm saying in front of the kids</i>

00:37:02.386 --> 00:37:03.621 line:95%,end
because it makes them feel bad.

00:37:03.688 --> 00:37:05.356 line:95%,end
It makes them feel
self-conscious and awkward.

00:37:05.423 --> 00:37:07.692 line:95%,end
MELISSA: No. Come with me. Girls.

00:37:07.758 --> 00:37:09.560 line:95%,end
They are staying with me.

You are uneducated mess.

Quit drinking.

00:37:20.037 --> 00:37:21.172 line:95%,end
Give me a phone.

I'm the (bleep)

Congratulations.

Hope you enjoyed
