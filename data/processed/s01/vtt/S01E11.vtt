-Ladies, here we are

00:00:02.535 --> 00:00:04.170 line:5%,start
in Los Angeles, California,

00:00:04.237 --> 00:00:05.605 line:5%,start
the city of dreams.

00:00:05.672 --> 00:00:07.774 line:5%,start
Laquifa, the postmodern pimp.

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:09.642 line:5%,start
-Hi, everybody.
-What are you doing here?

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:11.311 line:5%,start
I have kids that are working, too.

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:12.679 line:5%,start
-Doing what? What show?
-I have--

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:13.680 line:5%,start
Tell me what Broadway show she's in.

00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:14.748 line:5%,start
Well, she's not in a Broadway show.

00:00:14.814 --> 00:00:15.648 line:5%,start
Failure.

00:00:15.715 --> 00:00:18.184 line:5%,start
<i>You wanted an outside choreographer.</i>

00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:19.119 line:5%,start
Don't cry.

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:20.120 line:5%,start
I'm not.

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:22.188 line:5%,start
ABBY: It's all your fault to begin with.

00:00:22.255 --> 00:00:23.623 line:5%,start
<i>Right in the middle of the rehearsal,</i>

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.125 line:5%,start
<i>I get a phone call from my mom.</i>

00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:28.128 line:5%,start
I am here and my mother is in a hospital.

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:31.097 line:5%,start
<i>Coming up on </i>Dance Moms...

00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:32.966 line:5%,start
All right. Nationals in Tahoe.

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:35.068 line:5%,start
We need to win.

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:37.971 line:5%,start
Chloe tells me that she doesn't
want to dance anymore.

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:40.540 line:5%,start
I have a whole list of people
that want to take her spot.

00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:44.511 line:5%,start
I really don't appreciate my ex-husband
checking up on me.

00:00:44.577 --> 00:00:46.479 line:5%,start
Take the crown and shove it up your ass.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.050 line:5%,start
I really need to get
these ladies in control

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:53.119 line:5%,start
<i>before we step foot on a stage.</i>

00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:54.587 line:5%,start
Don't cry.

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:57.390 line:5%,start
Your top Junior group.

WOMAN: Can't wait to see
what the studio looks like.

00:01:20.847 --> 00:01:21.681 line:95%,end
Hi, Abby.

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:23.083 line:95%,end
Hello, ladies. Come on in.

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:24.150 line:95%,end
<i>This is Nationals.</i>

00:01:24.217 --> 00:01:25.919 line:95%,end
<i>It's all come down to this week.</i>

00:01:25.985 --> 00:01:28.421 line:5%,start
This is our last
competition of the season.

00:01:28.488 --> 00:01:31.558 line:5%,start
There's no more next weeks,
there's no more do-overs,

00:01:31.624 --> 00:01:34.160 line:95%,end
there's no more second
chances, this is it.

00:01:34.227 --> 00:01:36.663 line:95%,end
We have to win right here, right now.

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:39.566 line:95%,end
Here we are in another studio,
another week.

00:01:39.632 --> 00:01:41.034 line:95%,end
We need to learn a new group routine.

00:01:42.135 --> 00:01:43.536 line:95%,end
This is tough.

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:45.605 line:95%,end
We have to do it today and there's props.

00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:50.009 line:95%,end
Now I want to reflect a little bit
on the past two weeks.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.145 line:95%,end
I keep telling you guys,

00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:55.081 line:95%,end
you have been given
an amazing opportunity.

00:01:55.582 --> 00:01:59.219 line:95%,end
You've been hand-selected
to go across the country

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:02.055 line:95%,end
and learn a new number each
week and do these competitions.

00:02:02.755 --> 00:02:04.757 line:95%,end
And you are not stepping up to the plate.

00:02:04.824 --> 00:02:06.392 line:95%,end
<i>It's been a long road.</i>

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:07.594 line:95%,end
<i>The girls are tired.</i>

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:08.661 line:95%,end
<i>We're all tired.</i>

00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:12.398 line:95%,end
But this is when they really
need to push, focus,

00:02:12.465 --> 00:02:14.601 line:95%,end
dig down deep inside themselves,

00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:17.904 line:95%,end
and prove that they are the champions
that I have trained.

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:21.307 line:95%,end
I want to see energy, enthusiasm, fun.

00:02:21.374 --> 00:02:24.811 line:95%,end
If you don't want to do it,
there's probably 100 other kids

00:02:24.878 --> 00:02:27.046 line:95%,end
that would love to be
in your shoes right now.

00:02:28.281 --> 00:02:30.950 line:95%,end
So I need to see motivation.

00:02:31.017 --> 00:02:33.753 line:95%,end
I want you to want to win.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.789 line:95%,end
This is my reputation on the line,
it's my name,

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.459 line:95%,end
but by now, it's also your names.

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:43.530 line:95%,end
So I'm gonna start now with Paige.

00:02:44.564 --> 00:02:47.700 line:95%,end
Moving on, Mackenzie.

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:49.736 line:95%,end
Nia.

00:02:49.802 --> 00:02:51.304 line:95%,end
Next we have Chloe.

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:53.673 line:95%,end
Brooke.

00:02:55.575 --> 00:02:58.444 line:95%,end
And back on top, we have Maddie.

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:02.649 line:95%,end
You're doing your solo
and a duet with Chloe.

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:05.118 line:95%,end
Chloe, you will also be doing your solo.

00:03:06.386 --> 00:03:09.322 line:95%,end
Paige and Brooke, I'm giving you a duet.

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.058 line:95%,end
I want you to work together as friends.

00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:13.927 line:95%,end
I do not want you fighting as sisters.

00:03:13.993 --> 00:03:17.163 line:95%,end
If you waste time and energy
bickering back and forth,

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.865 line:95%,end
you're never gonna get it finished.

00:03:18.932 --> 00:03:21.701 line:95%,end
Everybody is in the group number
this week, even Mackenzie.

00:03:22.435 --> 00:03:25.271 line:5%,start
I'm a little scared to dance
in the group number.

00:03:25.338 --> 00:03:26.739 line:5%,start
I don't want to mess up.


00:03:26.806 --> 00:03:28.374 line:95%,end
Every single one of you

00:03:28.441 --> 00:03:30.310 line:95%,end
are an important part of this puzzle.

00:03:30.376 --> 00:03:31.578 line:95%,end
And in a group routine,

00:03:31.644 --> 00:03:34.714 line:95%,end
everybody needs to pull their weight.

00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:36.082 line:95%,end
And I'm telling you what.

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:37.617 line:95%,end
We need to win.

00:03:39.485 --> 00:03:41.054 line:95%,end
All right. Let's get to rehearsing.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.322 line:95%,end
Let's get moving.

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:47.126 line:5%,start
(gentle music playing)

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:48.995 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>Okay, ladies.</i>

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:50.363 line:95%,end
The piece is called "Beautiful."

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.098 line:5%,start
And what it's about

00:03:52.165 --> 00:03:55.868 line:5%,start
is not how pretty you're gonna be
in your costumes,

00:03:55.935 --> 00:03:57.503 line:95%,end
not how pretty your hair is,

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:58.738 line:95%,end
but what's on the inside.

00:03:59.272 --> 00:04:02.408 line:95%,end
And it's about taking a good look
in the mirror

00:04:02.475 --> 00:04:06.012 line:95%,end
not at what you see, but, like,
the internal mirror.

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:07.447 line:95%,end
Are you getting any of this, Mackenzie?

00:04:07.513 --> 00:04:09.015 line:95%,end
Yeah? It's a little deep.

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:11.317 line:5%,start
For Nationals, we're only
doing one group number.

00:04:11.384 --> 00:04:13.052 line:5%,start
It's called "This Is My Beauty."

00:04:13.453 --> 00:04:15.288 line:95%,end
Hold the mirror and cover your face.

00:04:15.355 --> 00:04:19.425 line:95%,end
The girls use handheld mirrors
as props for the routine.

00:04:19.492 --> 00:04:22.161 line:95%,end
<i>We're trying to get the message</i>
<i>across to the judges</i>

00:04:22.228 --> 00:04:24.764 line:95%,end
<i>that we believe that we're beautiful,</i>

00:04:24.831 --> 00:04:27.333 line:95%,end
dancing is beautiful,
everybody is beautiful.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.636 line:95%,end
You're gonna roll stage left.

00:04:29.702 --> 00:04:32.639 line:95%,end
Go. Roll. Left.

00:04:32.705 --> 00:04:34.507 line:95%,end
Take your right mirror out.

00:04:34.574 --> 00:04:36.242 line:95%,end
One, two, three, four.

00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:37.677 line:95%,end
-Oh, it's so nice out.
-Mm-hmm.

00:04:37.744 --> 00:04:39.779 line:95%,end
It's beautiful. I feel bad, actually,
coming out here

00:04:39.846 --> 00:04:41.447 line:95%,end
-and the girls are locked inside.
-I know.

00:04:41.514 --> 00:04:42.548 line:95%,end
Those poor kids.

00:04:43.583 --> 00:04:44.517 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: It's really pretty here.

00:04:44.584 --> 00:04:45.451 line:95%,end
KELLY: It is.

00:04:45.518 --> 00:04:46.953 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: So everybody sucks.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.920 line:95%,end
And that was the message.

00:04:47.987 --> 00:04:50.590 line:95%,end
You all sucked in the last two weeks,

00:04:50.657 --> 00:04:52.625 line:95%,end
but I want to see enthusiasm...

00:04:52.692 --> 00:04:54.193 line:95%,end
-MELISSA: I thought they did great.
-CHRISTI: ...and excitement.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.595 line:95%,end
Well, girls, I have news for you.

00:04:55.662 --> 00:04:56.729 line:95%,end
Pregnant.

00:04:56.796 --> 00:04:58.164 line:95%,end

-MELISSA: Bite your tongue!
-CHRISTI: Oh, my God.

00:05:00.433 --> 00:05:03.002 line:95%,end
I'm going on vacation without the girls.

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:03.970 line:95%,end
-When?
-HOLLY: Without them?

00:05:04.037 --> 00:05:06.139 line:95%,end
Yeah. So I'm leaving them here with Gia.

00:05:06.205 --> 00:05:07.340 line:95%,end
-In Tahoe?
-Well, let's just miss

00:05:07.407 --> 00:05:08.608 line:95%,end
the dance competition, okay?

00:05:08.675 --> 00:05:10.209 line:95%,end
-MELISSA: I'm so excited you.
-CHRISTI: Where are going?

00:05:10.276 --> 00:05:12.145 line:95%,end
Florida. I'm so excited.

00:05:12.211 --> 00:05:13.813 line:95%,end
-I just need to get away.
-Who are you going with?

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:14.714 line:95%,end
My honey.

00:05:14.781 --> 00:05:16.149 line:5%,start
I can't believe Melissa's leaving again.

00:05:16.215 --> 00:05:18.351 line:5%,start
Last week, she left to go spend time
with her boyfriend,

00:05:18.418 --> 00:05:20.586 line:95%,end
and this week, she's leaving
to go on vacation with him.

00:05:20.653 --> 00:05:22.255 line:95%,end
<i>Her priorities have definitely changed</i>

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:23.823 line:95%,end
<i>since the boyfriend came into the picture.</i>

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:24.824 line:95%,end
-Ladies...
-(indistinct)

00:05:24.891 --> 00:05:26.759 line:95%,end
...I need you to come in
and watch rehearsal.

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:27.827 line:95%,end
I need you to be in there the whole time.

00:05:27.894 --> 00:05:31.064 line:95%,end
I know it's hot,
but I need you to be in there.

00:05:32.732 --> 00:05:34.367 line:95%,end
Chloe, let's do it.

00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:38.371 line:5%,start
<i>Chloe's new solo, Another Season,</i>

00:05:38.438 --> 00:05:42.575 line:5%,start
is about rebirth and renewing

00:05:42.642 --> 00:05:45.345 line:95%,end
and moving on to a new story.

00:05:45.411 --> 00:05:47.580 line:95%,end
<i>And it's great because this</i>
<i>is the end of the season.</i>

00:05:47.647 --> 00:05:49.615 line:95%,end
It was the perfect choice.

00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:52.018 line:95%,end
Reach, reach. Up.

00:05:52.085 --> 00:05:53.553 line:95%,end
Ball changed down.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.256 line:95%,end
CHLOE: <i>For Nationals, I am doing</i>
<i>a dance called Seasons.</i>

00:05:57.323 --> 00:05:59.959 line:5%,start
It's a contemporary lyrical piece,
and I really like it.

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:01.728 line:95%,end
<i>I hope I win a title with it.</i>

00:06:01.794 --> 00:06:03.129 line:95%,end
ABBY: So no, it's not a Sissone. SautÃ©.

00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:05.098 line:95%,end
GIANNA: SautÃ©. Take off of one foot.

00:06:05.164 --> 00:06:09.836 line:5%,start
At rehearsal, I noticed Chloe
sort of not her regular self.

00:06:09.902 --> 00:06:12.972 line:95%,end
<i>I can see written all over her face</i>
<i>that something's wrong.</i>

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:17.076 line:95%,end
She just didn't have that same Chloe
passion that she normally does.

00:06:17.143 --> 00:06:18.144 line:95%,end
I know you're tired.

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:20.079 line:95%,end
I know this has been really
long and hard on you.

00:06:20.146 --> 00:06:21.981 line:95%,end
I do. I know.

00:06:22.048 --> 00:06:23.049 line:95%,end
I'm tired of dancing.

00:06:23.116 --> 00:06:24.884 line:95%,end
Sometimes, I just don't want to dance.

00:06:24.951 --> 00:06:26.953 line:95%,end
I mean, I love dance, I just--

00:06:27.019 --> 00:06:28.521 line:95%,end
I'm tired and I need a break.

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:30.957 line:95%,end
You want me to--here.

00:06:31.023 --> 00:06:32.225 line:95%,end
Lay down.

00:06:32.291 --> 00:06:33.659 line:95%,end
Here.

00:06:33.726 --> 00:06:36.796 line:95%,end
I talked to her and she tells me that
she doesn't want to dance anymore.

00:06:36.863 --> 00:06:38.464 line:95%,end
<i>That's very hard for me to hear</i>

00:06:38.531 --> 00:06:41.601 line:95%,end

00:06:41.667 --> 00:06:44.137 line:95%,end

give up on something

00:06:44.203 --> 00:06:46.172 line:95%,end
that she has such an amazing talent for.

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:48.374 line:95%,end
<i>But on the other hand, as a mother,</i>

00:06:48.441 --> 00:06:49.675 line:95%,end
<i>where do I draw the line?</i>

00:06:49.742 --> 00:06:51.577 line:95%,end
You know, when is enough enough for her?


00:06:55.815 --> 00:06:56.883 line:95%,end
All done?

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.354 line:95%,end
ABBY: (indistinct) you're early, babe.

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:05.792 line:95%,end

ABBY: <i>Hey moms?</i>

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.698 line:95%,end
Come on in here. I want to talk to you.

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:14.434 line:95%,end
<i>So I gather all the moms together</i>

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.937 line:5%,start
and I have them sit around
very casually in a circle

00:07:18.004 --> 00:07:20.206 line:5%,start
in a non-combative environment.

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:22.475 line:95%,end
<i>And I just want to kind</i>
<i>of give them a recap</i>

00:07:22.542 --> 00:07:25.044 line:95%,end
of what their children have done
and where we need to go.

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:26.612 line:95%,end
Let's start with Nia.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.681 line:95%,end
Work on your feet.

00:07:29.715 --> 00:07:32.051 line:95%,end
How many times have we gone over this?

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:35.721 line:95%,end
It is talking to that brick wall.

00:07:36.422 --> 00:07:37.356 line:95%,end
She has to try harder.

00:07:37.423 --> 00:07:40.326 line:5%,start
Abby's word choices are poor at best.

00:07:40.393 --> 00:07:42.195 line:95%,end
<i>I think when she refers to me</i>
<i>as a brick wall,</i>

00:07:42.261 --> 00:07:46.899 line:95%,end
that's incredibly demoralizing
and is not productive.

00:07:46.966 --> 00:07:48.901 line:95%,end
Because as a teacher, it's frustrating

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:51.137 line:95%,end
when another teacher will say
to a kid, try harder.

00:07:51.204 --> 00:07:52.805 line:95%,end
That means nothing to the kid

00:07:52.872 --> 00:07:54.240 line:95%,end
because they're just repeating
the same mistake

00:07:54.307 --> 00:07:55.675 line:95%,end
over and over again.

00:07:55.741 --> 00:07:56.943 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>I started off with Holly.</i>

00:07:57.009 --> 00:07:59.345 line:95%,end
And Holly is an educator herself.

00:07:59.412 --> 00:08:01.414 line:95%,end
And she always compares us,

00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:04.784 line:95%,end
but it's not really apple to apple.

00:08:04.851 --> 00:08:06.486 line:95%,end
It's like apple to orange.

00:08:06.853 --> 00:08:10.990 line:95%,end
<i>And I believe sometimes</i>
<i>she wants special treatment</i>

00:08:11.057 --> 00:08:12.358 line:95%,end
for Nia.

00:08:12.425 --> 00:08:13.893 line:95%,end
Like, but you have to teach her this way,

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.528 line:95%,end
you have to teach her that way.

00:08:15.595 --> 00:08:17.597 line:95%,end
I'm Abby Lee Miller.
I don't have to do anything.

00:08:18.097 --> 00:08:21.167 line:95%,end
All right. Let's move on to Chloe.

00:08:22.101 --> 00:08:23.336 line:95%,end
She needs to work on her confidence.

00:08:23.402 --> 00:08:25.071 line:95%,end
She's still second guesses herself.

00:08:25.137 --> 00:08:26.339 line:95%,end
That's how Chloe is.

00:08:26.405 --> 00:08:28.708 line:95%,end
I mean, that's something
we need to work on.

00:08:28.774 --> 00:08:30.676 line:95%,end
Chloe is a beautiful dancer.

00:08:30.743 --> 00:08:32.078 line:95%,end
She looks great.

00:08:32.144 --> 00:08:34.981 line:95%,end
And when you see her in class,
you pick her up,

00:08:35.047 --> 00:08:36.148 line:95%,end
your eyes go to her.

00:08:36.215 --> 00:08:38.651 line:95%,end
But when it gets down
to the end of an audition

00:08:38.718 --> 00:08:41.287 line:95%,end
and there's, like, three or four
girls left, she chokes.

00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:43.256 line:95%,end
She starts to second guess herself.

00:08:43.322 --> 00:08:45.291 line:95%,end
And that's definitely coming
from her mother.

00:08:46.325 --> 00:08:47.326 line:95%,end
Brooke.

00:08:47.927 --> 00:08:51.964 line:95%,end
I am disappointed in the group routines
with the ability to comprehend.

00:08:52.031 --> 00:08:53.332 line:95%,end
You saw it yesterday.

00:08:53.399 --> 00:08:55.968 line:95%,end
If I was their mother,
I would have crawled into a hole.

00:08:56.636 --> 00:09:01.107 line:95%,end
She's 13 years old
and was not picking up quickly.

00:09:01.173 --> 00:09:02.208 line:95%,end
They're slow.

00:09:02.275 --> 00:09:03.676 line:95%,end
They don't pick up quick.

00:09:03.743 --> 00:09:05.745 line:95%,end
Walk through it step-by-step with them.

00:09:05.811 --> 00:09:08.247 line:95%,end
We're not trying to be Maddie and Chloe.

00:09:08.314 --> 00:09:10.516 line:95%,end
-Neither one of my kids want to be them.
-But why do you want your kids

00:09:10.583 --> 00:09:11.617 line:95%,end
to be mediocre?

00:09:11.684 --> 00:09:13.686 line:95%,end
Because that's the way my kids are.

00:09:13.753 --> 00:09:17.223 line:95%,end
-And I love them the way they are, Abby.
-I disagree. I disagree.

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:19.258 line:95%,end
If they're not number one, we don't care.

00:09:19.325 --> 00:09:20.860 line:95%,end
They're my kids. I love them.

00:09:20.927 --> 00:09:22.628 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>I just don't get Kelly.</i>

00:09:22.695 --> 00:09:23.529 line:95%,end
But you know what?

00:09:23.596 --> 00:09:25.598 line:95%,end
Smack their heads together, wake them up,

00:09:25.665 --> 00:09:28.067 line:95%,end
tell them to get on the ball,
quit playing around,

00:09:28.134 --> 00:09:30.369 line:95%,end
invest in this like it's their future.

00:09:30.436 --> 00:09:31.537 line:95%,end
<i>This is real life.</i>

00:09:31.604 --> 00:09:34.740 line:95%,end
You have talented, beautiful children.

00:09:34.807 --> 00:09:36.442 line:95%,end
Make them own it.

00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:38.210 line:95%,end
<i>Quit saying they can be mediocre.</i>

00:09:38.277 --> 00:09:39.245 line:95%,end
You don't mean that.

00:09:39.312 --> 00:09:40.980 line:95%,end
Who wants a mediocre kid?

00:09:41.047 --> 00:09:42.148 line:95%,end
I want more.

00:09:42.214 --> 00:09:43.282 line:95%,end
I want more.

00:09:43.349 --> 00:09:44.917 line:95%,end
I want more. I want more.

00:09:44.984 --> 00:09:47.887 line:95%,end
Twelve hours a day at dance
and eight hours a day at school.

00:09:47.954 --> 00:09:48.888 line:95%,end
I mean, my God.

00:09:48.955 --> 00:09:50.389 line:95%,end
They're kids.

00:09:50.456 --> 00:09:51.891 line:95%,end
-And there's another kid somewhere else...
-I'm not gonna have my kid

00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.326 line:95%,end
-have a nervous breakdown...
-...working 14 hours.

00:09:53.392 --> 00:09:55.761 line:95%,end
...because you want them to be the best.

00:09:55.828 --> 00:09:57.129 line:95%,end
Yeah, but your kid just won another title.

00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:59.832 line:95%,end
Ab, would you like her crown back?

00:09:59.899 --> 00:10:01.133 line:95%,end
Because you can have it.

00:10:01.767 --> 00:10:03.002 line:95%,end
-We'll have to talk about that.
-Because she--

00:10:03.069 --> 00:10:05.271 line:95%,end
-ABBY: I--if she walks in--
-Take the crown and shove it up your ass

00:10:05.338 --> 00:10:06.305 line:95%,end
because we don't want it.

00:10:07.373 --> 00:10:08.975 line:95%,end
-You can go.
-Thank you.

out screaming at you.

Do they go home national champions

We're at Nationals this week

When Chloe was rehearsing this week,

She doesn't want--no.

Well, I have a whole group of kids,

00:12:33.352 --> 00:12:34.386 line:95%,end
-so--
-I realize.

00:12:34.453 --> 00:12:36.088 line:95%,end
But I wanted to make sure
that you were aware

-of what's going on with her.
-Okay. Well, that's fine.

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:40.025 line:95%,end
When we come back tonight,
if she wants to quit,

00:12:40.092 --> 00:12:42.862 line:95%,end

00:12:47.533 --> 00:12:49.268 line:95%,end
What do you want me to do?
Throw her in a plane and send her home

00:12:49.335 --> 00:12:51.203 line:95%,end
and bring in a replacement.

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:52.371 line:95%,end
I can do that.

You need to see the world.

00:13:31.343 --> 00:13:32.578 line:95%,end
<i>It takes time.</i>

00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:34.847 line:95%,end
And that was the ideal setting for that.


00:13:34.914 --> 00:13:36.715 line:95%,end
And how about I'm beautiful on the inside?

00:13:36.782 --> 00:13:38.350 line:95%,end
Can I hear it?

00:13:38.417 --> 00:13:41.053 line:95%,end
GIRLS: I'm beautiful on the inside.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:44.256 line:95%,end
Sometimes, I don't think Abby
knows what she's talking about.

00:13:44.323 --> 00:13:46.992 line:95%,end
Girls, I want you to sit here
and enjoy the view and relax.

00:13:47.059 --> 00:13:49.361 line:95%,end
Chloe, come on.
I want to take a walk with me real quick.

00:13:49.795 --> 00:13:53.399 line:95%,end
(dramatic music playing)

00:13:53.465 --> 00:13:56.001 line:95%,end
Chloe, your mom told me
that you had a breakdown.

00:13:56.769 --> 00:13:58.904 line:95%,end
You told her you didn't
want to dance anymore.

00:13:59.572 --> 00:14:02.975 line:95%,end
I just feel like it's a lot of rehearsal

00:14:03.042 --> 00:14:06.045 line:95%,end
and cause we're going from early
in the morning to late at night

00:14:06.111 --> 00:14:08.514 line:95%,end
and we're learning new dances.

00:14:08.581 --> 00:14:10.015 line:95%,end
And I just feel like it's a lot.

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:13.586 line:95%,end
Well, she thinks that you don't
want to ever dance again.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.323 line:95%,end
I--I just told my mom I wanted
to take a little break for a while.

00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:18.324 line:95%,end
Well, that's okay.

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:19.959 line:95%,end
Everybody needs a break once in a while.

00:14:20.659 --> 00:14:23.128 line:95%,end
But just remember,
I have a whole long list

00:14:23.195 --> 00:14:25.264 line:95%,end
of people that want to be in this group,

00:14:25.331 --> 00:14:27.833 line:95%,end
of people that want to do
duets with Maddie.

00:14:28.701 --> 00:14:30.336 line:95%,end
You're my first choice.

00:14:30.402 --> 00:14:32.671 line:95%,end
And I think you were really born to dance.

00:14:33.105 --> 00:14:35.441 line:95%,end
Do you think I'm gonna be able
to make it on Broadway

00:14:35.507 --> 00:14:37.076 line:95%,end
or become a Rockette someday?

00:14:37.142 --> 00:14:38.477 line:95%,end
Absolutely.

00:14:38.544 --> 00:14:42.748 line:95%,end
But the confidence level
needs to be over the top.

00:14:43.682 --> 00:14:47.219 line:5%,start
Abby told me that I have the potential
to be on Broadway.

00:14:47.286 --> 00:14:50.322 line:95%,end
And what she says to me
and what she thinks

00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:53.259 line:95%,end
<i>is pretty important to me</i>
<i>because she's my dance teacher.</i>

00:14:53.325 --> 00:14:54.760 line:95%,end
Everything is possible.

00:14:55.127 --> 00:14:56.195 line:95%,end
Everything.

00:14:56.262 --> 00:14:59.365 line:95%,end
And if you keep listening to me
and do what I tell you, yes.

00:14:59.431 --> 00:15:00.466 line:95%,end
Come on.

00:15:00.532 --> 00:15:03.535 line:95%,end
(dramatic music playing)

00:15:06.939 --> 00:15:08.374 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Get our shoes first.

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.109 line:95%,end
KELLY: Oh, they have a whole bar in there.

00:15:10.175 --> 00:15:11.911 line:95%,end
Do you got any with rhinestones?

00:15:11.977 --> 00:15:13.512 line:5%,start
Abby pushes me way too much.

00:15:13.579 --> 00:15:15.414 line:5%,start
I think that I need to get away from her

00:15:15.481 --> 00:15:16.749 line:95%,end
and I think the girls do, too.

00:15:17.149 --> 00:15:18.717 line:95%,end
<i>So we decided we were</i>
<i>going to go do something</i>

00:15:18.784 --> 00:15:20.019 line:95%,end
<i>fun with the girls.</i>

00:15:20.085 --> 00:15:21.253 line:95%,end
(cheering and screaming)

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.588 line:95%,end
I told her she could take Brooke's crown

00:15:22.655 --> 00:15:23.956 line:95%,end
and shove it up her ass.

00:15:24.023 --> 00:15:25.591 line:95%,end
You know, I really do mean that.

00:15:27.192 --> 00:15:29.094 line:5%,start
I'm leaving tomorrow for vacation,

00:15:29.161 --> 00:15:32.264 line:5%,start
so it's nice to go out with the kids
for something fun

00:15:32.331 --> 00:15:33.666 line:95%,end
<i>and not rehearsal.</i>

00:15:36.468 --> 00:15:39.471 line:5%,start
I'm Kurt. I'm the father of Maddie
and Mackenzie.

00:15:39.538 --> 00:15:41.273 line:95%,end
(chatter)

00:15:44.143 --> 00:15:46.011 line:95%,end
<i>I came here because I found out</i>

00:15:46.078 --> 00:15:48.314 line:95%,end
Melissa was going on vacation.

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:50.115 line:95%,end
<i>She didn't tell me she was going away.</i>

00:15:50.182 --> 00:15:51.417 line:95%,end
<i>She didn't tell me anything.</i>

00:15:54.186 --> 00:15:55.154 line:95%,end
So Missy...

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:57.122 line:95%,end
Why didn't you tell me, seriously?

00:15:57.189 --> 00:15:58.891 line:95%,end
I did, Kurt.
I don't want to talk about it.

00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.025 line:95%,end
I told you.

00:16:00.092 --> 00:16:01.126 line:95%,end
-Yes, I did. You don't listen to me.
-I mean--

00:16:01.193 --> 00:16:02.261 line:95%,end
I'm not trying to fight with you.

00:16:02.328 --> 00:16:03.729 line:95%,end
-Then don't. I did tell you.
-If you would've told me--I would--

00:16:03.796 --> 00:16:06.198 line:95%,end
if you would've said that to me,
I would've known.

00:16:06.265 --> 00:16:08.200 line:95%,end
Kurt, I did tell you. Yes, I did.

00:16:08.267 --> 00:16:10.102 line:95%,end
You don't listen to me when I talk.
I told you.

00:16:10.569 --> 00:16:12.071 line:95%,end
<i>Kurt is not a very good listener.</i>

00:16:12.137 --> 00:16:13.872 line:95%,end
<i>I told him that I was leaving.</i>

00:16:13.939 --> 00:16:15.007 line:95%,end
<i>My whole marriage with him,</i>

00:16:15.074 --> 00:16:17.076 line:5%,start
he just never listens to what I say.

00:16:17.142 --> 00:16:18.510 line:95%,end
I heard from a third party...

00:16:18.577 --> 00:16:20.079 line:95%,end
-MELISSA: So, I told you--
-...that my kids are gonna be...

00:16:20.145 --> 00:16:21.213 line:95%,end
-...MELISSA: Kurt, I told you.
-...without a parent all week.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:22.514 line:95%,end
So what? Who cares?

00:16:23.182 --> 00:16:24.783 line:95%,end
-I don't want any problems.
-MELISSA: Go, Kenzie!

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:26.285 line:95%,end
-But that was...
-Look, look, look.

00:16:26.352 --> 00:16:27.453 line:95%,end
GIRL: Fifteen.

00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:28.754 line:95%,end
...totally uncalled for.

00:16:29.722 --> 00:16:31.924 line:95%,end
<i>I was really mad</i>
<i>because I really don't appreciate</i>

00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:34.360 line:95%,end
when my ex-husband is checking up on me.

00:16:34.426 --> 00:16:35.995 line:95%,end
Guys, we got to leave.

00:16:36.061 --> 00:16:39.898 line:95%,end
Dance had a lot to do
with the breakup of my family.

00:16:40.499 --> 00:16:42.835 line:95%,end
<i>I mean, I'm their father</i>
<i>and I have a right to know</i>

00:16:42.901 --> 00:16:44.403 line:95%,end
<i>who's watching my kids.</i>

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:46.438 line:95%,end
I'm not leaving here.
I'm staying with my kids.


00:16:50.809 --> 00:16:53.946 line:95%,end
(upbeat rock music playing)

00:16:58.984 --> 00:17:00.119 line:95%,end
<i>So we're in Lake Tahoe</i>

00:17:00.185 --> 00:17:01.887 line:5%,start
and we're gonna do
the Starbound Competition.

00:17:01.954 --> 00:17:04.056 line:5%,start
And this is our last chance to win.

00:17:04.123 --> 00:17:06.091 line:95%,end
Hey, girls. Good morning.

00:17:07.259 --> 00:17:09.628 line:95%,end
Brooke and Paige are doing
a duet together this week.

00:17:09.695 --> 00:17:11.030 line:95%,end
And I'm very excited about it.

00:17:11.096 --> 00:17:13.232 line:95%,end
My girls have never danced together.
I think it'll be nice.

00:17:14.233 --> 00:17:15.901 line:5%,start
I'm doing a duet with my sister Brooke.

00:17:15.968 --> 00:17:19.071 line:5%,start
And the song's called "Ooh La La"
and I really like it.

00:17:19.138 --> 00:17:22.908 line:95%,end
Nia, Mackenzie, Chloe, Maddie,

00:17:22.975 --> 00:17:24.710 line:95%,end
you could go through
the group dance a little bit,

00:17:24.777 --> 00:17:26.111 line:95%,end
but we're gonna rehearse it later.

00:17:26.178 --> 00:17:30.249 line:95%,end
Brooke and Paige, I'm gonna send
the girls into the other room.

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:33.085 line:95%,end
Abby sent my two daughters

00:17:33.152 --> 00:17:35.587 line:95%,end
into another room
with a guest choreographer,

00:17:35.654 --> 00:17:37.656 line:95%,end
<i>and Abby and Gianna stayed in the room</i>

00:17:37.723 --> 00:17:39.391 line:95%,end
and were teaching Maddie her solo.

00:17:39.458 --> 00:17:41.260 line:5%,start
<i>I was not very happy with that.</i>

00:17:41.326 --> 00:17:44.296 line:5%,start
I mean, why is there two teachers in there

00:17:44.363 --> 00:17:45.898 line:95%,end
that know what my kids can do,

00:17:46.398 --> 00:17:47.933 line:95%,end
<i>both working with Maddie?</i>

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.170 line:95%,end
But this is why Maddie wins
and my kids don't.

00:17:52.337 --> 00:17:54.673 line:5%,start
ABBY: <i>I had a rehearsal coach</i>
<i>in there with them</i>

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.642 line:95%,end
<i>just to kind of guide them</i>
<i>through some things.</i>

00:17:56.708 --> 00:17:58.444 line:5%,start
Paige and Brooke have never done a duet,

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:01.513 line:95%,end
so I wanted one of the other
dance instructors

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:03.549 line:95%,end
<i>to work with them on some double tricks</i>

00:18:03.615 --> 00:18:05.484 line:95%,end
<i>and what they could do holding hands.</i>

00:18:05.551 --> 00:18:09.121 line:95%,end
All I wanted to do was give them
something to do

00:18:09.188 --> 00:18:10.756 line:95%,end
while I finished up with Maddie.

00:18:10.823 --> 00:18:13.092 line:95%,end
Mine are gonna learn theirs in 15 minutes

00:18:13.158 --> 00:18:15.561 line:95%,end
from a choreographer who doesn't
even know what leg kick on.

00:18:15.627 --> 00:18:17.229 line:95%,end
CHOREOGRAPHER: Do you want me
to say something to her?

00:18:17.296 --> 00:18:18.597 line:95%,end
-I mean, I don't--
-But the world...

00:18:18.664 --> 00:18:19.498 line:95%,end
CHOREOGRAPHER:
Cause you're gonna be a--

00:18:19.565 --> 00:18:20.599 line:95%,end
...needs to see why Maddie wins.

00:18:21.867 --> 00:18:24.603 line:95%,end
Some children are difficult to work with

00:18:25.037 --> 00:18:27.406 line:95%,end
and some children are a joy to work with.

00:18:27.473 --> 00:18:30.476 line:95%,end
My kids are in here with someone
who they just met

00:18:30.542 --> 00:18:32.044 line:95%,end
two weeks ago.

00:18:32.111 --> 00:18:34.213 line:95%,end
<i>That's the problem.</i>

00:18:34.279 --> 00:18:35.447 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>Kelly totally flipped.</i>

00:18:35.514 --> 00:18:36.782 line:95%,end
<i>She was out of line.</i>

00:18:36.849 --> 00:18:38.717 line:95%,end
<i>She was rude and disrespectful</i>

00:18:38.784 --> 00:18:41.153 line:95%,end
and I could hear every
word she was saying.

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:46.358 line:95%,end
Kelly, do you really think
that Maddie can't work

00:18:46.425 --> 00:18:48.760 line:95%,end
with a choreographer
she met two weeks ago?

00:18:49.561 --> 00:18:53.298 line:95%,end
I think there's no reason for you
to have two of you in there

00:18:53.365 --> 00:18:54.666 line:95%,end
and mine in here with someone

00:18:54.733 --> 00:18:56.802 line:95%,end
who doesn't even know
what leg they kick on.

00:18:56.869 --> 00:18:58.971 line:95%,end
No. He's supposed to be choreographing.

00:18:59.037 --> 00:19:00.939 line:95%,end
Well, then let him choreograph Maddie.

00:19:01.006 --> 00:19:02.774 line:95%,end
That sure as hell would never happen.

00:19:04.076 --> 00:19:06.578 line:95%,end
CHOREOGRAPHER: All right.
Well, let's keep going on.

00:19:06.645 --> 00:19:09.414 line:95%,end
We'll get 10th place.

00:19:09.481 --> 00:19:12.584 line:95%,end
Maddie, obviously, will get first,
and so will their duet.

00:19:12.651 --> 00:19:13.719 line:95%,end
CHOREOGRAPHER: Yeah.

00:19:13.785 --> 00:19:14.920 line:95%,end
Kelly?

00:19:14.987 --> 00:19:16.121 line:95%,end
Come in here.

00:19:16.989 --> 00:19:18.557 line:95%,end
I don't feel like fighting with her.

00:19:20.626 --> 00:19:21.460 line:95%,end
What?

00:19:21.527 --> 00:19:22.561 line:95%,end
I have no problem.

00:19:22.628 --> 00:19:24.329 line:95%,end
We would be more than happy
to do her number,

00:19:24.396 --> 00:19:25.697 line:95%,end
but you have to wait.

00:19:25.764 --> 00:19:28.167 line:95%,end
One of you two should be helping him.

00:19:28.233 --> 00:19:31.436 line:95%,end
You can surely teach Maddie yourself.

00:19:32.104 --> 00:19:36.775 line:95%,end
But no, Maddie's the priority,
so both of the main teachers

00:19:36.842 --> 00:19:38.377 line:95%,end
work here.

00:19:38.911 --> 00:19:41.246 line:95%,end
But Maddie, you can go and win, honey.

00:19:41.313 --> 00:19:43.048 line:95%,end
<i>Obviously, nothing was gonna change.</i>

00:19:43.115 --> 00:19:45.250 line:95%,end
Abby was still gonna finish with Maddie,

00:19:45.317 --> 00:19:47.419 line:95%,end
and I was still gonna have
the guest choreographer

00:19:47.486 --> 00:19:49.688 line:95%,end
who was asking me what they could do.

00:19:49.755 --> 00:19:51.723 line:95%,end
<i>I'm not a teacher.</i>
<i>I'm not a choreographer.</i>

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:52.858 line:95%,end
I mean, I'm the dance mom.

00:19:53.258 --> 00:19:54.126 line:95%,end
Jealousy.

00:19:54.193 --> 00:19:57.563 line:95%,end
And it went right back to being jealous
of the eight-year-old Maddie.

00:19:57.629 --> 00:19:59.164 line:95%,end
Let's go. We're leaving.

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.534 line:95%,end
<i>I'm done with it.</i>

00:20:02.601 --> 00:20:03.735 line:95%,end
I'm done.

00:20:03.802 --> 00:20:05.604 line:95%,end
My kids, I don't care
if they ever dance again.

00:20:06.205 --> 00:20:08.140 line:95%,end
<i>And Maddie can win again this week.</i>

00:20:08.207 --> 00:20:10.309 line:95%,end
And the world can think she's fabulous

<i>I don't know if he makes her nervous.</i>

00:21:48.507 --> 00:21:51.410 line:95%,end
and she feels that she's betraying
her mom if she's nice her dad.

00:21:51.476 --> 00:21:53.845 line:95%,end
But she definitely didn't want him around.

a little defeated right now.

00:22:28.547 --> 00:22:30.849 line:95%,end

00:27:50.268 --> 00:27:55.240 line:95%,end

00:28:41.686 --> 00:28:43.855 line:95%,end

and that we were together,

00:29:03.942 --> 00:29:05.844 line:5%,start
but I don't think we were
really that together

00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:08.780 line:95%,end
because every time we looked over
we were kind of, like, off.

00:29:08.847 --> 00:29:11.416 line:95%,end
I don't think it was the best time
I've ever danced.

00:29:11.483 --> 00:29:12.884 line:95%,end
-You did great.
-Good job, ladies.

00:29:12.951 --> 00:29:13.918 line:95%,end

<i>Maddie and Chloe have had several duets,</i>

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:48.613 line:95%,end
but this new duet was a little edgier,

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:50.381 line:95%,end
<i>and Chloe looked gorgeous.</i>

00:30:50.448 --> 00:30:51.516 line:95%,end
<i>She was evil.</i>

00:30:51.583 --> 00:30:53.351 line:95%,end
<i>She was sophisticated.</i>

00:30:53.418 --> 00:30:54.719 line:95%,end
<i>She just was stunning.</i>

00:30:54.786 --> 00:30:58.156 line:95%,end
I think this was Chloe's opportunity
to redeem herself

00:30:58.223 --> 00:31:00.725 line:95%,end
in front of this panel of judges,

00:31:00.792 --> 00:31:02.627 line:95%,end
so she went out there like Gangbusters,

00:31:02.694 --> 00:31:04.495 line:95%,end
and they just knocked one out of the park.

00:31:04.562 --> 00:31:05.663 line:95%,end
It was amazing.

<i>Maddie and Chloe,</i>

00:31:16.307 --> 00:31:18.743 line:5%,start
I mean, if you watched
the two dances side-by-side,

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:22.747 line:5%,start
their choreography is a totally
different level of choreography.

00:31:22.814 --> 00:31:24.616 line:95%,end
<i>You can see that on stage.</i>

00:31:24.682 --> 00:31:26.417 line:95%,end
<i>Also the costumes.</i>

00:31:26.484 --> 00:31:28.887 line:95%,end
They have a custom-made
costume on their body.

00:31:28.953 --> 00:31:30.655 line:95%,end
I got a bra from the mall.

00:31:30.722 --> 00:31:34.125 line:95%,end
I mean, it's like I'm purposely
sticking my kids on stage

00:31:34.192 --> 00:31:35.927 line:95%,end
to be made fools of.

00:31:35.994 --> 00:31:36.895 line:95%,end
And I'm tired of it.

00:31:36.961 --> 00:31:38.763 line:5%,start

<i>I wasn't really surprised</i>

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:58.283 line:5%,start
just because I knew it wasn't
really our best number.

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:03.888 line:95%,end
And now it's time to announce
your Top Overall

00:32:03.955 --> 00:32:06.658 line:95%,end
Junior Duet Trio.

00:32:09.527 --> 00:32:12.330 line:95%,end

Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:32:16.501 --> 00:32:17.769 line:5%,start
For my duet with Maddie,

<i>we got the overall,</i>
<i>high score first place,</i>

00:32:20.305 --> 00:32:21.706 line:95%,end

00:32:22.407 --> 00:32:23.741 line:95%,end
KELLY: Good job, swans.

00:32:23.808 --> 00:32:25.576 line:95%,end
Good job, guys.

00:32:25.643 --> 00:32:26.477 line:95%,end
Good job.

00:32:26.544 --> 00:32:28.947 line:95%,end
Hey, hey. Congratulations.

00:32:29.013 --> 00:32:32.183 line:95%,end
<i>It's very important that the girls</i>

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:34.886 line:95%,end

<i>our final Nationals.</i>

00:32:36.554 --> 00:32:38.456 line:95%,end
I want the girls to win.

00:32:38.523 --> 00:32:41.326 line:95%,end
They have worked too hard,
they've come too far.

00:32:41.392 --> 00:32:45.196 line:95%,end
We need a winning number
and they need to pull it together.

00:32:45.263 --> 00:32:46.564 line:95%,end
Remember Lake Tahoe?

00:32:46.631 --> 00:32:49.133 line:95%,end
The gorgeous lake,
the beautiful mountains,

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:52.370 line:95%,end
how pristine,
how beautiful everything was?

00:32:52.437 --> 00:32:54.238 line:95%,end
That's why I took you there.

00:32:54.305 --> 00:32:58.276 line:95%,end
I want you to walk on stage
and be that same vision.

00:32:58.343 --> 00:33:00.244 line:95%,end
So when those judges look up, they go...

00:33:00.311 --> 00:33:01.546 line:95%,end
(gasping)

00:33:01.612 --> 00:33:04.415 line:95%,end
If the tops come up, do not freak.

00:33:04.482 --> 00:33:06.084 line:95%,end
The judges have seen it all. Believe me.

00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:07.418 line:95%,end
They're all in show business.

00:33:07.485 --> 00:33:08.786 line:95%,end
You've seen one boob,
you've seen them all.

00:33:10.855 --> 00:33:13.091 line:95%,end
Hey. No, no, no, no, no.

00:33:13.157 --> 00:33:14.425 line:95%,end
<i>So Kurt comes in the dressing room</i>

00:33:14.492 --> 00:33:17.895 line:5%,start
and Abby doesn't even let his foot
cross the threshold.

00:33:17.962 --> 00:33:19.897 line:95%,end
<i>And she's like you, out.</i>
<i>I need to talk to you.</i>

00:33:20.365 --> 00:33:23.735 line:95%,end
And I'm just sitting there thinking,
"Well, for once, it's not me."

00:33:23.801 --> 00:33:25.903 line:95%,end
I don't want you near her.

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:27.672 line:95%,end
-Why?
-Because you get her worked up.

00:33:27.739 --> 00:33:30.641 line:95%,end
I've told you before,
this is not the place or the time.

00:33:30.708 --> 00:33:31.743 line:95%,end
We want to win this group dance.

00:33:31.809 --> 00:33:34.345 line:95%,end
She's an integral part of it
and I want her to be focused.

00:33:34.412 --> 00:33:36.781 line:5%,start
Why he makes her nervous, I don't know.

00:33:36.848 --> 00:33:40.084 line:5%,start
But he was an athlete, he claims,

00:33:40.151 --> 00:33:42.954 line:95%,end
and he did all this
and he knows everything.

00:33:43.021 --> 00:33:46.057 line:95%,end
And I think he tries to give her tips
that don't make sense.

00:33:46.124 --> 00:33:49.861 line:95%,end
And he's rude to other people.

00:33:49.927 --> 00:33:52.263 line:95%,end
So that is offensive to Maddie.

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:53.598 line:95%,end
And it gets her worked up

00:33:53.664 --> 00:33:55.700 line:95%,end
and she doesn't want to be
embarrassed by her dad.

00:33:55.767 --> 00:33:57.268 line:95%,end
I'm not working my daughters up.

00:33:57.335 --> 00:33:58.636 line:95%,end
-How am I working them up?
-ABBY: You don't think you are

00:33:58.703 --> 00:33:59.637 line:95%,end
<i>-and you are.</i>
-KURT: <i>How am I working them up?</i>

00:33:59.704 --> 00:34:01.072 line:95%,end
<i>What other dad is in that room right now?</i>

00:34:01.139 --> 00:34:02.106 line:95%,end
Not one other dad.

00:34:02.173 --> 00:34:03.975 line:95%,end
That goes to show you
that I'm here for my kids.

00:34:04.042 --> 00:34:06.210 line:95%,end
Five minutes before she's
supposed to go on stage,

00:34:06.277 --> 00:34:08.746 line:95%,end
she does not need you in there
saying something stupid.

00:34:08.813 --> 00:34:11.182 line:95%,end
-What do I say that you think she--
-No, she just gets upset.

00:34:11.249 --> 00:34:12.550 line:95%,end
-She does not get upset.
-Yes, she does.

00:34:12.617 --> 00:34:13.651 line:95%,end
-No, she doesn't.
-I've seen her.

00:34:13.718 --> 00:34:15.353 line:95%,end
I know my daughter more than you do.

00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:16.487 line:95%,end
Trust me. I know my daughter.

00:34:16.554 --> 00:34:17.555 line:95%,end
I spend more time with her.

00:34:17.622 --> 00:34:20.691 line:95%,end
You know what this dance has done
to me and my family, don't you?

00:34:20.758 --> 00:34:22.794 line:95%,end
What? You know what? You keep saying that.

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:24.095 line:95%,end
-It's true.
-But I'll tell you what.

00:34:24.162 --> 00:34:26.064 line:95%,end
You have them brainwashed.
They live in fear.

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:29.233 line:95%,end
I didn't need Melissa to be at the studio,

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:31.302 line:95%,end
she wanted to be there all those hours.

00:34:31.369 --> 00:34:32.904 line:95%,end

And I want you to know, too, you--

-You did not...

-...at home with you, making dinner--
-...you didn't make my daughters.

00:34:37.508 --> 00:34:38.609 line:95%,end
-You didn't make my daughters.
-ABBY: No.

00:34:38.676 --> 00:34:39.977 line:95%,end
-I trained her.
-You trained her.

00:34:40.044 --> 00:34:41.345 line:95%,end
-And I put her name on the map.
-That's right, that's right.

00:34:41.412 --> 00:34:42.480 line:95%,end
I will tell you this.

00:34:42.547 --> 00:34:44.582 line:95%,end
