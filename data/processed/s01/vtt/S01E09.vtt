00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.504 line:95%,end

00:02:51.571 --> 00:02:53.206 line:95%,end
definitely in the top 10.

you're getting a solo.

I've had it with that.

00:03:15.595 --> 00:03:18.064 line:95%,end
It's what you do on stage that matters,

00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:20.400 line:95%,end
not the choreography,
not the costuming,

00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:23.369 line:95%,end
it's you and your technique that
is gonna win the first place.

Certainly somebody from Cirque
is going to be judging you here.

00:03:50.597 --> 00:03:53.566 line:95%,end

why because Chloe didn't dance last week.


00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.825 line:95%,end

a solo this week.

00:04:32.071 --> 00:04:35.074 line:95%,end
It's giving her a little break
so maybe she can swim a little

00:04:35.141 --> 00:04:37.477 line:95%,end

the mothers talking about

how Maddie gets all the attention,

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:48.221 line:95%,end

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:49.789 line:95%,end
Now who are they gonna blame?

00:04:49.856 --> 00:04:51.357 line:95%,end
Chloe, you wanted this shot.

is at the top of the pyramid,

this has nothing to do with you.

The concept of this contemporary routine

is Sin City.

00:05:52.618 --> 00:05:55.755 line:95%,end
We chose a piece about
the seven deadly sins,

00:05:55.822 --> 00:05:57.290 line:95%,end
but we don't have seven girls.

00:05:57.357 --> 00:05:59.058 line:95%,end

Especially in her age category.

00:06:28.254 --> 00:06:29.589 line:95%,end

HOLLY: That was my concern for
the (indistinct) dance was the same thing.

00:06:35.661 --> 00:06:37.397 line:95%,end
-There wasn't a lot of dance--
-CHRISTI: Well, Nia (indistinct) pyramid.

00:06:37.463 --> 00:06:38.798 line:95%,end
-KELLY: Yeah!
-She did.

00:06:38.865 --> 00:06:40.199 line:95%,end
-How about the big...
-HOLLY: Although--

00:06:40.266 --> 00:06:41.601 line:95%,end
...red slash over Vivi's face?

00:06:41.667 --> 00:06:42.735 line:95%,end
HOLLY: How cruel.

00:06:42.802 --> 00:06:43.770 line:95%,end
That is cruel!

00:06:43.836 --> 00:06:45.872 line:95%,end
HOLLY: You should never put any
mark on anybody's face.

00:06:45.938 --> 00:06:47.073 line:95%,end
It's like one big bullseye.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:48.474 line:95%,end
Why don't you just throw darts at it?

00:06:48.541 --> 00:06:49.742 line:95%,end
-Wait until Cathy sees that.
-CHRISTI: She's not gonna--

00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:51.210 line:95%,end
-HOLLY: I would be offended.
-I don't think we're ever gonna

00:06:51.277 --> 00:06:52.111 line:95%,end
see Cathy again.

00:06:52.178 --> 00:06:53.980 line:95%,end

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:12.899 line:5%,start
I was really happy to see the Ohio sign,
Ohio welcomes you.

00:07:12.965 --> 00:07:14.434 line:95%,end
I couldn't have been happier.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.503 line:95%,end
(foreboding music playing)

00:07:23.476 --> 00:07:28.147 line:95%,end
CATHY: First of all, ladies, gentleman,
I'm so happy to be back.

00:07:28.214 --> 00:07:32.852 line:95%,end
As you know, I was splitting
my time from the Abby Lee Dance Center

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:34.086 line:95%,end
and Candy Apples.

00:07:34.153 --> 00:07:36.189 line:95%,end
I wanted Vivi to get
a little bit more experience

00:07:36.255 --> 00:07:39.192 line:95%,end
because she's starting
to get on that brink of titles,

00:07:39.258 --> 00:07:44.464 line:95%,end
and with me being her mom,
I wanted to let her go to a dance teacher

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:47.333 line:95%,end
that wasn't me and wasn't Erin,

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.135 line:95%,end
and I felt that that was important.

00:07:49.202 --> 00:07:53.606 line:95%,end
But while I was there,
it was an experience of a lifetime.

00:07:53.673 --> 00:07:56.342 line:95%,end
She is winning competitions,
and I say she,

00:07:56.409 --> 00:07:58.511 line:95%,end
I am talking about Abby Lee Miller.

00:07:58.578 --> 00:08:01.781 line:95%,end
And I don't know how
she is winning everywhere

00:08:01.848 --> 00:08:07.587 line:95%,end
she goes because her kids
have a ton of technical issues.

00:08:07.653 --> 00:08:11.557 line:95%,end
I'm starting to feel this energy
that the plan that I'm going for

00:08:11.624 --> 00:08:13.493 line:95%,end
is what I really,
truly am going to do,

00:08:13.559 --> 00:08:14.894 line:95%,end
and I'm gonna put it in motion.

00:08:14.961 --> 00:08:17.497 line:95%,end
And that is that Candy Apples
Dance Center is going

00:08:17.563 --> 00:08:19.799 line:95%,end
to meet up with the Abby Lee dancers
in Hollywood,

00:08:19.866 --> 00:08:21.601 line:95%,end
<i>and we're gonna go head to head.</i>

00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:23.836 line:95%,end
There are going to be
three of you that get

00:08:23.903 --> 00:08:25.538 line:95%,end
to go to Hollywood, California.

00:08:25.605 --> 00:08:28.608 line:95%,end

00:08:29.609 --> 00:08:33.112 line:95%,end

you are going to go to Hollywood.

CATHY:
Vivi, Vivi had the inside scoop there.

00:08:39.619 --> 00:08:41.287 line:95%,end
You are going to go to Hollywood.

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:45.291 line:95%,end
And our third Apple,
Taylor (indistinct)

00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:48.160 line:95%,end
Taylor, you will be doing
a contemporary piece

00:08:48.794 --> 00:08:51.898 line:95%,end
and competing against one
of Abby's so-called finest.

00:08:51.964 --> 00:08:53.132 line:95%,end
Is it vengeance?

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:55.401 line:95%,end
I would say it's artistic vengeance

00:08:55.468 --> 00:08:58.671 line:95%,end
because I want her to see
what Vivi is capable of.

00:08:58.738 --> 00:09:00.473 line:95%,end
Hollywood, here we come!

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.875 line:95%,end
ALL: Hollywood, here we come!

00:09:02.942 --> 00:09:04.410 line:95%,end

CATHY:
I've got a plan where we can say,

00:09:07.079 --> 00:09:09.949 line:95%,end
we came, we saw,
we kicked apples.

ABBY: Let's go from
the top with the music.

00:09:19.825 --> 00:09:22.628 line:5%,start
Place, lift, open.

00:09:22.695 --> 00:09:23.896 line:5%,start
Back, flex hard!

(contemporary music playing)

00:09:26.699 --> 00:09:27.700 line:95%,end
Better.

00:09:28.367 --> 00:09:29.368 line:95%,end
Go.

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:32.405 line:95%,end
Push.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.575 line:95%,end
Better.

00:09:35.641 --> 00:09:37.443 line:95%,end
Hold, step, down.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:38.511 line:95%,end
Good.

00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:40.179 line:95%,end
<i>Since we are here in Las Vegas,</i>

00:09:40.246 --> 00:09:42.381 line:95%,end
<i>I wanted to do something about the sins.</i>

00:09:42.448 --> 00:09:43.683 line:95%,end
<i>It's a very dark number.</i>

00:09:43.749 --> 00:09:46.185 line:95%,end
There is a section of the routine
where each girl does

00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:50.456 line:95%,end
their own choreography,
and I assigned each one of them

00:09:50.523 --> 00:09:53.125 line:95%,end
a sin to portray.

00:09:53.192 --> 00:09:58.397 line:95%,end
Brooke, you would be Sloth,
so I'm telling you right now,

00:09:58.464 --> 00:10:01.133 line:95%,end
you have all this amazing
talent and you throw it away

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.501 line:95%,end
and you give it to me sloppy.

00:10:02.568 --> 00:10:05.538 line:5%,start
None of us really knew
what the seven deadly sins were,

00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:08.040 line:95%,end
and Abby had to explain it to us.

00:10:08.107 --> 00:10:10.776 line:95%,end
ABBY: Paige,
you are going to be Gluttony.

00:10:12.144 --> 00:10:13.479 line:95%,end
Is that the one that's fat?

00:10:13.546 --> 00:10:16.048 line:95%,end
Gluttony--it's not--
no, you're just thinking

00:10:16.115 --> 00:10:17.550 line:95%,end
like a pig is like a glutton.

00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:19.051 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>The dance was called Sinful.</i>

00:10:19.518 --> 00:10:23.022 line:5%,start
They were all doing different parts,

00:10:23.089 --> 00:10:24.824 line:95%,end
but I don't think
they needed to be labeled.

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:28.694 line:95%,end
I think it was just another way
for Abby to give a dig.

00:10:28.761 --> 00:10:31.731 line:95%,end
ABBY: Nia, you are going to be Greed.

00:10:31.797 --> 00:10:34.367 line:95%,end
You want it all, you want it right now,
and you want it your way.

00:10:34.433 --> 00:10:36.202 line:95%,end
HOLLY: <i>Nia was assigned greedy.</i>

00:10:36.268 --> 00:10:39.105 line:5%,start
Mia is the antithesis of greedy.

00:10:39.171 --> 00:10:42.341 line:5%,start
She is--there's not a greedy bone
in that child's body.

00:10:42.408 --> 00:10:45.011 line:95%,end
Maddie, you are going to be Wrath.

00:10:45.077 --> 00:10:51.017 line:95%,end
What that means is you get upset,
you are ragingly angry.

00:10:51.083 --> 00:10:54.687 line:95%,end
MELISSA: <i>She actually handed</i>
<i>each person their own sin</i>

00:10:54.754 --> 00:10:57.757 line:95%,end
<i>so they can act it out on stage,</i>
<i>but it was just for a dance.</i>

00:10:57.823 --> 00:10:58.824 line:5%,start
It's just acting.

00:10:58.891 --> 00:11:01.260 line:5%,start
It's just a role
that everyone has to play.

00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:02.928 line:95%,end
ABBY: Chloe's gonna be Envy.

00:11:02.995 --> 00:11:04.463 line:95%,end
Do you know what envy is?

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:08.401 line:95%,end
Envy is like, you wish you had
what another person had,

00:11:08.467 --> 00:11:11.003 line:95%,end
or you wish that that other person
didn't have it.

CHRISTI: <i>I knew Abby was going</i>
<i>to assign Chloe envy,</i>

and Chloe came over to me,
and she said--

00:11:16.142 --> 00:11:18.678 line:95%,end
she was upset because she said,
I'm not jealous of Maddie.

00:11:18.744 --> 00:11:20.546 line:95%,end
No, she's not jealous of Maddie.

00:11:20.613 --> 00:11:21.947 line:95%,end
The only thing Chloe's jealous of

00:11:22.014 --> 00:11:24.316 line:95%,end
is the fact that Abby
treats Maddie like a person.

00:11:24.784 --> 00:11:26.686 line:95%,end
Brooke, I need you to be back a little bit

00:11:26.752 --> 00:11:28.621 line:95%,end
so that it's staggered on that.

00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:29.755 line:95%,end
Move off-stage.

a little bit about the posture

<i>You have to have really good posture</i>

It's kind of like walking like a giraffe.

There's one thing.

I was a principle in the show,

00:13:46.792 --> 00:13:48.894 line:95%,end
We do things while our kids
are doing things.

00:13:48.961 --> 00:13:51.297 line:95%,end
I'm so sorry.
I had to go pick up Chloe's costume.

00:13:51.363 --> 00:13:53.098 line:95%,end
Oh, your costume's ready?

00:13:53.165 --> 00:13:54.800 line:95%,end
I'm assuming yours isn't?

00:13:55.334 --> 00:13:56.569 line:95%,end
Would you expect anything different?

00:13:57.803 --> 00:13:58.804 line:95%,end
Let me see that costume.

00:13:58.871 --> 00:14:00.039 line:95%,end
Oh, it's cute.

00:14:00.105 --> 00:14:01.574 line:95%,end
Yeah, rub it in a little bit.

she's a little French traveler.

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:08.981 line:95%,end
but my kids don't.

00:14:09.048 --> 00:14:12.484 line:95%,end
I just don't understand why
my kid never has a costume.

00:14:13.385 --> 00:14:17.256 line:95%,end
She doesn't get the time
with the choreography and stuff like that.

00:14:17.323 --> 00:14:19.391 line:95%,end
She gets the (bleep)
choreography, and then--

00:14:19.458 --> 00:14:21.227 line:95%,end
-The (bleep) costumes?
-...and when she does get them,

00:14:21.293 --> 00:14:24.597 line:95%,end
they don't fit or they don't go
with the dance.

00:14:24.663 --> 00:14:27.099 line:95%,end
-CHRISTI: I don't--I don't--
-I'm just so tired of it.

00:14:27.466 --> 00:14:28.300 line:95%,end
I'm sorry.

00:14:29.201 --> 00:14:31.403 line:95%,end
I don't know, I hate Vegas.

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:32.905 line:95%,end
I know.
We need to do something fun.

00:14:32.972 --> 00:14:35.207 line:95%,end
We'll have to think about it and
find something that...

00:14:35.274 --> 00:14:36.976 line:95%,end
-CHRISTI: Right.
-...everybody could do.

00:14:37.042 --> 00:14:39.478 line:95%,end
Well, I think we need to go because
the kids are almost done with rehearsal.

Our cupcake date's over.

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:42.414 line:95%,end

It was so yummy.

<i>Maddie competing against me.</i>

00:14:55.227 --> 00:14:58.330 line:5%,start
I guess people say
she's my biggest competitor.

00:14:58.864 --> 00:14:59.865 line:95%,end
Watch that arm.

00:14:59.932 --> 00:15:01.333 line:95%,end
I put a lot of pressure on Chloe

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:04.904 line:95%,end
because I am sick and tired
of hearing the Maddie excuse.

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:07.973 line:95%,end
You know what?
There's 1,000 Maddies out there.

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:09.575 line:95%,end
You can't control it.

00:15:09.642 --> 00:15:13.012 line:95%,end
Go out there and do your best
and win because you're great.

00:15:13.078 --> 00:15:15.247 line:95%,end
<i>Chloe has amazing opportunities.</i>

00:15:15.314 --> 00:15:17.716 line:95%,end

00:15:19.985 --> 00:15:20.986 line:95%,end
Big!

00:15:22.054 --> 00:15:25.190 line:95%,end
CHLOE: When Miss Abby's tough
on me it's definitely

00:15:25.257 --> 00:15:26.725 line:95%,end
not the greatest feeling.

00:15:26.792 --> 00:15:29.028 line:95%,end
I am giving you this opportunity, yes?

00:15:29.094 --> 00:15:32.264 line:95%,end
I'm sick and tired of hearing,
"I never win, I never win,

00:15:32.331 --> 00:15:34.033 line:95%,end
it's not about me,
it's not about me."

00:15:34.099 --> 00:15:35.100 line:95%,end
It's about you.

00:15:35.167 --> 00:15:36.669 line:95%,end
Yes?
You have a new solo.

00:15:36.735 --> 00:15:38.103 line:95%,end
Go out there and win.

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:40.606 line:95%,end
She can be tough.

00:15:40.673 --> 00:15:42.174 line:95%,end
She can be very tough.

Oh, no.

take a little break

00:19:54.026 --> 00:19:55.994 line:95%,end
-What's going on?
-Dance competition for our kids.

00:19:56.061 --> 00:19:57.262 line:95%,end
Doesn't it look like it?

00:19:57.329 --> 00:19:58.564 line:95%,end
Yeah, yeah, I grew up--well, yeah,

00:19:58.630 --> 00:19:59.731 line:95%,end
I've been dancing my whole life.

00:19:59.798 --> 00:20:01.333 line:95%,end
We work at Peep Show. So...

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.267 line:95%,end
Do you dance in Peep Show?

00:20:02.334 --> 00:20:03.402 line:95%,end
-MAN 1: Yeah.
-Oh!

00:20:03.468 --> 00:20:04.937 line:95%,end
MAN 1: You guys should come see it.

00:20:05.003 --> 00:20:05.904 line:95%,end
It's pretty awesome.

00:20:05.971 --> 00:20:06.972 line:95%,end
Oh, hell no.

00:20:07.039 --> 00:20:08.040 line:95%,end
Nope, sorry.

00:20:08.106 --> 00:20:10.676 line:5%,start
I'm definitely not gonna go
see a peep show in Vegas

00:20:10.742 --> 00:20:12.477 line:5%,start
when my daughters are here with me.

00:20:12.544 --> 00:20:14.713 line:95%,end
That would be something
for like a bachelorette party.

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:17.282 line:95%,end
Do you believe this woman
has every degree under the sun

00:20:17.349 --> 00:20:19.184 line:95%,end
and never closed a bar until recently?

00:20:19.251 --> 00:20:20.919 line:95%,end
-WOMAN: I've never closed a bar--
-Are you serious?

00:20:20.986 --> 00:20:23.422 line:95%,end
You guys are so far away.
We gotta get a little closer.

00:20:23.488 --> 00:20:26.558 line:95%,end
(threatening music playing)

00:20:26.625 --> 00:20:27.826 line:95%,end
MAN 2: What degrees do you have?

00:20:27.893 --> 00:20:29.861 line:95%,end
I have a bachelor's,
a master's, and a doctorate.

00:20:29.928 --> 00:20:31.830 line:95%,end
That's what--we want her
to be a plastic surgeon.

00:20:31.897 --> 00:20:34.900 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: She didn't mention
that her doctorate is from Penn.

00:20:34.967 --> 00:20:36.935 line:95%,end
MAN 2: Like the people
who make the tennis balls?

00:20:37.536 --> 00:20:39.204 line:95%,end
I bet your neck hurts.

00:20:39.972 --> 00:20:42.474 line:95%,end
Yeah, cause your brain is so big.

00:20:44.743 --> 00:20:47.045 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I think it was funny
that they were flirting with Holly.

00:20:48.046 --> 00:20:52.117 line:95%,end
Dr. Holly was getting the moves
put on her at the pool.

00:20:52.184 --> 00:20:54.820 line:95%,end
MAN 3: Okay. Who will give me their number
so I can call you?

00:20:54.886 --> 00:20:55.921 line:95%,end
Let's roll!

00:20:55.988 --> 00:20:57.789 line:95%,end
HOLLY: <i>Where did those guys come from?</i>

00:20:57.856 --> 00:20:59.258 line:5%,start
Why don't they go back there?

00:20:59.324 --> 00:21:01.426 line:95%,end
Well, I want some tickets
to come see you guys.

00:21:01.493 --> 00:21:02.494 line:95%,end
-All right.
-We can hook that up.

00:21:02.561 --> 00:21:05.364 line:95%,end
Give us your number and we'll
make some bad decisions later.

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:06.565 line:95%,end
(laughter)

00:21:07.165 --> 00:21:09.735 line:95%,end
We'll make some bad
decisions--go ahead, Kel.

00:21:09.801 --> 00:21:11.270 line:95%,end
-MAN 1: She didn't say no.
-MAN 2: Didn't say no.

00:21:11.336 --> 00:21:12.404 line:95%,end
-All right.
-All right, ladies.

00:21:12.471 --> 00:21:13.772 line:95%,end
-Later, guys.
-Have a good night.

00:21:13.839 --> 00:21:16.074 line:95%,end
Good luck. Have a good show.

00:21:16.942 --> 00:21:19.478 line:95%,end
-Bye-bye.
-Bye, nice meeting you.

00:21:19.544 --> 00:21:20.746 line:95%,end
(interposing voices)

00:21:20.812 --> 00:21:23.081 line:95%,end
-Look at you, Dr. Holly.
-HOLLY: Thank you.

GIANNA: Do you know this, Brooke?
Shoulders down.


00:21:34.893 --> 00:21:37.296 line:95%,end
KELLY: Brooke's dance this week
is called "Metamorphosis,"

00:21:37.362 --> 00:21:39.464 line:95%,end
and I think it's a perfect
choice for Brooke.

00:21:39.531 --> 00:21:44.369 line:95%,end
It's almost like she's coming
from a baby into a young woman.

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:46.772 line:95%,end
GIANNA:
Where are your legs on that?

00:21:51.209 --> 00:21:52.411 line:95%,end
I think they're--

00:21:52.878 --> 00:21:55.047 line:95%,end
Let's just walk through it
once from the top, okay?

00:21:55.113 --> 00:21:56.315 line:95%,end
My shoulder hurts.

00:21:56.381 --> 00:21:57.382 line:95%,end
GIANNA: Again?

00:21:58.183 --> 00:21:59.885 line:95%,end
-This has happened before, yeah?
-Mm-hm.

00:21:59.951 --> 00:22:00.886 line:95%,end
GIANNA:
You just have to get through it.

00:22:00.952 --> 00:22:04.556 line:95%,end
If it pops out,
we just need to get it back in there.

00:22:04.623 --> 00:22:06.458 line:95%,end
Just like, pop it back in.

00:22:06.525 --> 00:22:09.194 line:5%,start
BROOKE: Lately my shoulder
has been hurting pretty bad

00:22:09.261 --> 00:22:11.129 line:5%,start
when I do my handstand twist.

00:22:11.196 --> 00:22:14.232 line:95%,end
<i>I don't think I'm gonna be</i>
<i>able to dance with my shoulder pain</i>

00:22:14.299 --> 00:22:15.500 line:95%,end
just because it--

00:22:15.567 --> 00:22:17.502 line:95%,end
I'm always putting pressure on my hands.

00:22:17.569 --> 00:22:19.071 line:95%,end
Come on, Brooke, pull. Harder.

00:22:19.137 --> 00:22:20.205 line:95%,end
I know it hurts.

00:22:21.273 --> 00:22:23.775 line:95%,end
BROOKE:
Not performing is not an option for me.

00:22:27.579 --> 00:22:30.515 line:95%,end
(brassy jazz music playing)

00:22:33.418 --> 00:22:35.320 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: So you're at the top
of the pyramid, kiddo.

00:22:35.387 --> 00:22:40.359 line:95%,end
Yeah, but Miss Abby was saying
to me like, oh, since Maddie's

00:22:40.425 --> 00:22:42.661 line:95%,end
not in this, you have to win,
you have to win.

00:22:42.728 --> 00:22:45.464 line:95%,end
You don't have to win
because Maddie's not in this.

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:46.365 line:95%,end
You're Chloe.

00:22:46.431 --> 00:22:49.968 line:95%,end
You're different, and there is nothing
wrong with being Chloe.

00:22:50.035 --> 00:22:54.439 line:95%,end
Chloe is amazing
because I wouldn't trade one Chloe

00:22:54.506 --> 00:22:55.907 line:95%,end
for a hundred Maddies.

00:22:55.974 --> 00:22:59.845 line:5%,start
This week Abby is putting an exorbitant
amount of pressure on Chloe.

00:22:59.911 --> 00:23:01.279 line:95%,end
<i>She's screaming at her,</i>
<i>telling her,</i>

00:23:01.346 --> 00:23:03.582 line:95%,end
you're at the top of the pyramid,
you better win.

00:23:04.082 --> 00:23:05.717 line:95%,end
But I promise you,
I pinky swear,

00:23:06.852 --> 00:23:11.056 line:95%,end
I pinky swear
that I will not let her continue

00:23:11.123 --> 00:23:12.991 line:95%,end
to treat you this way, okay?

00:23:13.058 --> 00:23:14.526 line:95%,end
All right? Lock it.

00:23:14.593 --> 00:23:15.794 line:95%,end

Chlo, I'll be back, okay?

CHRISTI: <i>When Chloe told me that Abby</i>
<i>has been screaming in her face</i>

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:48.627 line:95%,end
and belittling her
and talking to her the way she is,

00:23:48.693 --> 00:23:51.763 line:95%,end
I will not put up with this anymore.

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:53.098 line:95%,end
I can't. I can't.

00:23:53.165 --> 00:23:56.802 line:95%,end
It is my duty as Chloe's mother
to put an end to it.

Okay. There's someone at my door,
hang on.

00:24:09.915 --> 00:24:10.982 line:95%,end
Okay.
All right.

00:24:11.049 --> 00:24:12.117 line:95%,end
Well, let me--


00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:17.122 line:95%,end
(knocking)

00:24:17.189 --> 00:24:18.423 line:95%,end

There's someone

00:24:21.126 --> 00:24:22.461 line:95%,end
Okay. All right.

00:24:22.527 --> 00:24:23.528 line:95%,end
Well, let me--

00:24:25.597 --> 00:24:28.033 line:95%,end
-CHRISTI: I need to talk to you.
-This is rude, again.

00:24:28.099 --> 00:24:28.934 line:95%,end
Come on.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.671 line:5%,start
Christi came to my hotel room unannounced,
which I did not appreciate.

00:24:32.737 --> 00:24:36.341 line:95%,end
She didn't know if I was indisposed
or if I was in the shower or what.

00:24:36.408 --> 00:24:38.877 line:95%,end
But you know her,
raised in a barn,

00:24:38.944 --> 00:24:41.112 line:95%,end
comes knocking on the door,
I need to talk to you.

00:24:41.179 --> 00:24:42.481 line:95%,end
We'll talk about rude.

00:24:42.547 --> 00:24:46.218 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>Christi is rude,</i>
<i>arrogant, and she's clueless.</i>

00:24:46.284 --> 00:24:47.652 line:95%,end
You're not paying me for this time.

00:24:47.719 --> 00:24:49.120 line:95%,end
You owe me this time.

00:24:49.187 --> 00:24:51.756 line:95%,end
I owe you nothing.

00:24:51.823 --> 00:24:54.359 line:95%,end
-You cannot--
-You're incredibly rude to my daughter.

00:24:54.426 --> 00:24:57.162 line:95%,end
All I'm asking you for
is to treat my daughter

00:24:57.229 --> 00:24:58.864 line:95%,end
with a little bit of respect.

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:01.132 line:95%,end
I do every single time!

00:25:01.199 --> 00:25:04.503 line:95%,end
When you are in the picture
your child looks at you.

00:25:04.569 --> 00:25:06.705 line:95%,end
-Because she's afraid of you.
-ABBY: She's like this.

00:25:06.771 --> 00:25:08.807 line:95%,end
You ask her a question
and she goes like this.

00:25:08.874 --> 00:25:11.810 line:95%,end
<i>It's like she's competing with you and me</i>

00:25:11.877 --> 00:25:12.978 line:95%,end
<i>and you and me and you and me.</i>

00:25:13.044 --> 00:25:16.515 line:95%,end
When she's there with me all day
she's loving at that's studio.

<i>I've been doing this for 30 years.</i>

00:25:18.617 --> 00:25:22.454 line:95%,end
There is a great camaraderie,
a wonderful, beautiful relationship

00:25:22.521 --> 00:25:23.655 line:95%,end
between the child and I,

00:25:23.722 --> 00:25:25.590 line:95%,end
and the mother is jealous.

00:25:25.657 --> 00:25:28.159 line:95%,end
You have a problem with your kid!
Get some help!

00:25:28.226 --> 00:25:29.060 line:95%,end
Oh, Abby.

00:25:29.127 --> 00:25:29.961 line:95%,end
You do.

00:25:30.028 --> 00:25:32.998 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: You who live in glass houses
shouldn't throw stones.

00:25:33.064 --> 00:25:35.333 line:95%,end
I'll throw whatever
the hell I want to throw.

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:36.535 line:95%,end
You know why?

00:25:36.601 --> 00:25:40.405 line:95%,end
Because I am responsible
for Chloe's success.

00:25:40.472 --> 00:25:43.708 line:95%,end
<i>She wants to be a showgirl herself.</i>

00:25:43.775 --> 00:25:45.277 line:95%,end
She missed her opportunity.

00:25:45.343 --> 00:25:47.012 line:95%,end
It's Chloe's time.

00:25:47.078 --> 00:25:48.647 line:95%,end
Let me do my job.

00:25:48.713 --> 00:25:50.415 line:95%,end
She is a beautiful dancer.

00:25:50.482 --> 00:25:53.018 line:95%,end
-She's a great kid, but she looks...
-CHRISTI: Treat her like that, then.

00:25:53.084 --> 00:25:54.486 line:95%,end
...for you with one eye.

00:25:54.553 --> 00:25:56.721 line:95%,end
Like this,
scared to death to fail.

00:25:57.188 --> 00:25:58.823 line:95%,end
Oh, my God,
all she does is fail!

00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:00.559 line:95%,end
All you do is set her up to fail!

00:26:00.625 --> 00:26:02.561 line:95%,end
-You've--
-She's holding two national titles!

00:26:02.627 --> 00:26:05.163 line:95%,end
You went up--you went backstage
before something

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:06.831 line:95%,end
and said, be like Maddie!

00:26:06.898 --> 00:26:08.967 line:95%,end
Who does that to a kid?

00:26:09.034 --> 00:26:10.135 line:95%,end
Deny it all you want.

00:26:10.201 --> 00:26:12.237 line:95%,end
-Deny it all you--
-Why wouldn't you want to be like Maddie?

00:26:12.304 --> 00:26:13.305 line:95%,end
I want to be like Maddie!

00:26:13.371 --> 00:26:15.473 line:95%,end
Because Chloe doesn't need
to be like Maddie.

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:17.509 line:95%,end
Chloe is Chloe and that is good enough!

00:26:17.576 --> 00:26:19.177 line:95%,end
-For who?
-For her.

00:26:19.244 --> 00:26:20.278 line:95%,end
Not for you.

00:26:20.345 --> 00:26:21.179 line:95%,end
Yes, it is!

00:26:21.246 --> 00:26:23.014 line:95%,end
ABBY: Then why are you so jealous
of an eight-year-old?

00:26:23.081 --> 00:26:24.082 line:95%,end
Oh, my God.

00:26:24.149 --> 00:26:25.750 line:95%,end
You should love her unconditionally.

00:26:25.817 --> 00:26:28.553 line:95%,end
I do--Abby, don't you dare
question my parenting.

00:26:29.487 --> 00:26:30.322 line:95%,end
I do.

00:26:32.157 --> 00:26:34.659 line:95%,end
The bottom line is
I would really appreciate it

00:26:34.726 --> 00:26:36.928 line:95%,end
if you could just be a little bit
kinder to my daughter.

00:26:36.995 --> 00:26:37.996 line:95%,end
That's the bottom line.

00:26:38.063 --> 00:26:40.765 line:95%,end
My tears aren't a sign of sadness.

00:26:40.832 --> 00:26:42.400 line:95%,end
<i>They're really frustration.</i>

kind of and move forward

a different set of judges,
