ABBY: <i>A major Broadway casting agent</i>

00:00:04.404 --> 00:00:05.739 line:5%,start
<i>is coming to my studio.</i>

00:00:05.805 --> 00:00:06.940 line:5%,start
We can stop.
We can stop.

CHRISTI: <i>It's our annual</i>
<i>Dance Company Showcase.</i>

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:10.944 line:5%,start
(applause)

00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:12.579 line:5%,start
ABBY: What is she doing?

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:14.080 line:5%,start
She changed the dance.

00:00:14.147 --> 00:00:16.182 line:5%,start
KELLY: <i>If she wanted to do a solo</i>
<i>she should have just did it.</i>

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:18.184 line:5%,start
Because none of us wanted to do
the stupid dance, anyways.

00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:19.219 line:5%,start
CASTING AGENT: <i>Maddie is a star.</i>

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:21.054 line:5%,start
Come with me, Maddie.

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:22.956 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: The whole Broadway
casting agent thing

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:24.090 line:5%,start
was total bull (bleep).

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.327 line:5%,start
ABBY: <i>Coming up</i>
<i>on </i>Dance Moms...

00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:29.896 line:5%,start
We are going to Starpower.

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:33.333 line:5%,start
This is the last regional
to qualify for their nationals.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.300 line:5%,start
Oh, my God.

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:36.202 line:5%,start
My grandmother just got
rushed to the hospital.

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:38.338 line:5%,start
My grandma got bad,
overnight. (crying)

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:40.640 line:5%,start
I don't know if I should go.

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:42.409 line:5%,start
KELLY: <i>Brooke's costume is awful.</i>

00:00:42.475 --> 00:00:45.045 line:5%,start
CATHY: <i>Brooke is now</i>
<i>wearing Vivi's top.</i>

00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:46.012 line:5%,start
<i>I'm not happy.</i>

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.647 line:5%,start
I don't want Brooke
wearing the costume.

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:49.716 line:5%,start
My daughter is dancing
in three minutes.

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:50.984 line:5%,start
And you're taking
the costumer off of her back.

00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:53.153 line:5%,start
-I know. It doesn't fit her!
-Go back to your studio.

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.723 line:5%,start
You know what? I'm not.
I'm here to stay, so like it.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.992 line:95%,end

(tense music playing)

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.705 line:5%,start
I want to talk about
this upcoming weekend.

00:01:12.772 --> 00:01:14.074 line:95%,end
It's regionals.

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:16.709 line:95%,end
Everybody knows
how important that is.

00:01:16.776 --> 00:01:19.312 line:95%,end
We are going to Starpower.

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:21.614 line:95%,end
You know that's one
of the toughest competitions out there.

00:01:21.681 --> 00:01:23.850 line:5%,start
This week is make
or break for nationals.

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:27.287 line:95%,end
We've worked for months
to get to this point, right now.

00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:29.322 line:95%,end
This is what's going to happen
for this next weekend.

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:32.525 line:95%,end
Maddie, new solo.

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:34.160 line:95%,end
Brooke, new solo.

00:01:34.227 --> 00:01:35.462 line:95%,end
Chloe, new solo.

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.230 line:95%,end
Now...

00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:40.467 line:95%,end
HOLLY: <i>Once again, here we are.</i>

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:42.001 line:5%,start
Nia is never picked for a solo.

00:01:42.068 --> 00:01:44.304 line:95%,end
<i>I'm losing confidence in Abby</i>

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.139 line:95%,end
<i>because she doesn't believe</i>
<i>in my kid.</i>

00:01:46.206 --> 00:01:47.974 line:95%,end
ABBY: The age categories
are a little different,

00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:51.111 line:95%,end
so we want to make sure
that your dance is about you,

00:01:51.177 --> 00:01:53.346 line:95%,end
a dancer now,
not the beginning of the season.

00:01:53.413 --> 00:01:55.849 line:5%,start
Every competition's age
category is different.

00:01:55.915 --> 00:01:58.918 line:5%,start
Usually, Chloe and Maddie
end up in the same age group

00:01:58.985 --> 00:02:00.620 line:95%,end
because they're
only a year apart.

00:02:00.687 --> 00:02:02.455 line:95%,end
But this time, at Starpower,

00:02:02.522 --> 00:02:04.757 line:95%,end
Chloe is in the nine
to eleven age category

00:02:04.824 --> 00:02:06.292 line:95%,end
and Maddie
is in the eight and under.

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:08.094 line:95%,end
<i>Chloe deserves a chance to win</i>

00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:10.530 line:95%,end
<i>without the shadow of Maddie</i>
<i>hovering over her.</i>

00:02:10.597 --> 00:02:12.866 line:95%,end
We are doing a new
group routine this weekend

00:02:12.932 --> 00:02:15.935 line:95%,end
and everybody is in it,
the entire cast.

00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:20.006 line:95%,end
It is called "Where Have
All the Children Gone."

00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:24.978 line:95%,end
This is a routine about
children who become missing.

00:02:25.044 --> 00:02:27.580 line:95%,end
You've all seen the children's
faces on the milk cartons.

00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:31.518 line:95%,end
It's contemporary,
it's mature, and it is very dark.

00:02:31.584 --> 00:02:34.687 line:95%,end
You have to be great
actresses to pull it off.

00:02:34.754 --> 00:02:37.056 line:95%,end
And they're all in white,
like they're angels.

00:02:38.725 --> 00:02:41.060 line:95%,end
I don't want any discrepancies.

00:02:41.127 --> 00:02:43.596 line:95%,end
I don't want any opinions.

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:44.864 line:5%,start
"Where Have All
the Children Gone"

00:02:44.931 --> 00:02:48.701 line:5%,start
is one of those routines
that simple and clean,

00:02:48.768 --> 00:02:50.236 line:95%,end
but it tells a story.

00:02:50.303 --> 00:02:51.704 line:95%,end
<i>It makes you think.</i>

00:02:51.771 --> 00:02:53.339 line:95%,end
<i>And that's what</i>
<i>people are looking for</i>

00:02:53.406 --> 00:02:56.176 line:95%,end
<i>in an overall high score</i>
<i>winning number.</i>

00:02:56.242 --> 00:02:57.477 line:95%,end
This is a big regionals for us,

00:02:57.544 --> 00:02:59.612 line:95%,end
and I want them to do something

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:00.847 line:95%,end
that nobody's ever seen before.

00:03:00.914 --> 00:03:01.881 line:95%,end
I want to change it up.

00:03:01.948 --> 00:03:04.083 line:95%,end
<i>And I don't think any of the moms</i>

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.785 line:95%,end
<i>would dare say anything to me.</i>

00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:07.887 line:95%,end
Moms, I'm going to go ahead
and dismiss you now.

00:03:07.954 --> 00:03:09.055 line:95%,end
We have lots of work to do.

00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:11.090 line:95%,end
Girls, up. Let's get moving.
Let's get moving.

00:03:11.157 --> 00:03:11.991 line:95%,end
Come on.

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:14.794 line:5%,start
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go. Let's go.

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:17.163 line:5%,start
(upbeat music playing)

00:03:18.798 --> 00:03:22.001 line:95%,end
MAN (whispering):
<i>All the children once running around</i>

00:03:22.068 --> 00:03:23.970 line:95%,end
<i>have evacuated.</i>

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:28.308 line:95%,end
<i>Where have</i>
<i>all the children gone?</i>

00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:29.809 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>"Where Have All</i>
<i>the Children Gone"</i>

00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:32.812 line:95%,end
<i>is a very haunting,</i>
<i>dark piece of music.</i>

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.814 line:95%,end
<i>When you're out of competition,</i>

00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:36.616 line:95%,end
the dancers
that everybody's talking about

00:03:36.683 --> 00:03:38.484 line:95%,end
the next day, or the pieces,

00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:40.253 line:95%,end
are the ones that
told the story.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.122 line:95%,end
<i>The kids that could act</i>
<i>as well as dance,</i>

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:44.624 line:95%,end
<i>the choreographers</i>

00:03:44.691 --> 00:03:46.392 line:95%,end
<i>that made you think</i>
<i>about something,</i>

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:47.860 line:95%,end
<i>that made you feel something.</i>

00:03:47.927 --> 00:03:49.996 line:95%,end
<i>And that's what "Where Have</i>
<i>All the Children Gone"</i>

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:51.197 line:95%,end
<i>does to people.</i>

00:03:52.665 --> 00:03:54.500 line:95%,end
MAN (whispering):
<i>This is just a dream.</i>

00:03:55.568 --> 00:03:57.003 line:95%,end
The original concept

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.139 line:95%,end
is about children
that have gone missing,

00:04:00.206 --> 00:04:02.075 line:95%,end
so the kids
on the milk carton,

00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:03.343 line:95%,end
the kids in the news every night.

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:05.645 line:95%,end
<i>But I put a little edge to it</i>

00:04:05.712 --> 00:04:08.481 line:95%,end
<i>as to maybe there</i>
<i>was some bullying involved</i>

00:04:08.548 --> 00:04:11.784 line:95%,end
and it was causing other children
to commit suicide.

00:04:11.851 --> 00:04:13.720 line:95%,end
<i>That's what the story is about.</i>

00:04:13.786 --> 00:04:17.390 line:95%,end
MAN (whispering):
<i>We hope they're hiding.</i>

00:04:17.457 --> 00:04:19.459 line:5%,start
To be honest, I don't really know

00:04:19.525 --> 00:04:22.629 line:5%,start
what the meaning of
"Where Have All the Children Gone."

00:04:22.695 --> 00:04:24.964 line:95%,end
But Miss Abby said
we're giving the message

00:04:25.031 --> 00:04:27.967 line:95%,end
<i>to parents that this has</i>
<i>still been happening</i>

00:04:28.034 --> 00:04:30.370 line:95%,end
<i>and you should be safe.</i>

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:33.106 line:95%,end
But it really like it.

00:04:33.172 --> 00:04:36.075 line:95%,end
It's really cool
and creepy and awesome.

00:04:36.142 --> 00:04:40.246 line:95%,end
MAN (whispering):
<i>Where have all the children gone?</i>

00:04:41.014 --> 00:04:43.650 line:95%,end
I love dark stuff
because I do dark stuff.

00:04:43.716 --> 00:04:45.718 line:95%,end
And I even did
a missing child thing.

00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:48.154 line:95%,end
But I don't think
that this is age appropriate

00:04:48.221 --> 00:04:49.856 line:95%,end
for Mackenzie and Vivi, at all.
I'm sorry.

00:04:49.922 --> 00:04:51.557 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I'm surprised.
I'm surprised at this.


00:04:51.624 --> 00:04:53.192 line:95%,end
Yeah. I'm not happy
about that, at all.

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:55.361 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>It is very disturbing song.</i>

00:04:55.428 --> 00:04:57.997 line:95%,end
<i>My kids are fine</i>
<i>with it being dark music.</i>

00:04:58.064 --> 00:05:00.266 line:5%,start
I don't even think
they really listen to the words

00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:01.801 line:95%,end
<i>of whether</i>
<i>the costume or the music--</i>

00:05:01.868 --> 00:05:04.137 line:95%,end
I mean, it's just,
that's the art of it.

00:05:04.203 --> 00:05:05.738 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>I really worry</i>

00:05:05.805 --> 00:05:08.474 line:5%,start
that this number
may be too heavy for girls this age.

00:05:08.541 --> 00:05:10.943 line:95%,end
<i>It might be too depressing,</i>
<i>not only for the audience</i>

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.412 line:95%,end
<i>but for the judges, as well.</i>

00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:14.113 line:95%,end
HOLLY: <i>To me,</i>
<i>it's about child abduction.</i>

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.018 line:95%,end
Is a message that I know,
for Nia, makes her very sad.

00:05:19.085 --> 00:05:21.921 line:95%,end
<i>And I'm a little</i>
<i>uncomfortable with it.</i>

00:05:21.988 --> 00:05:23.790 line:95%,end
Come in close.
Listen to me.

00:05:23.856 --> 00:05:25.792 line:95%,end
You're dancing.
You're doing steps.

00:05:25.858 --> 00:05:27.260 line:95%,end
You're trying to listen
to the words.

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:30.663 line:95%,end
You're not interpreting
the story correctly.

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.866 line:95%,end
And this is very serious because
maybe people in the audience

00:05:33.933 --> 00:05:36.235 line:95%,end
have had a child
that's gone missing,

00:05:36.302 --> 00:05:38.271 line:95%,end
so you're going
to touch somebody's heart.

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:40.473 line:95%,end
So this has to be
a very serious routine.

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.176 line:95%,end
And right now
you're just doing the steps.

00:05:43.242 --> 00:05:46.179 line:95%,end
And we need to get past that,
and we need to perform.

00:05:46.245 --> 00:05:47.780 line:95%,end
Do you two understand?

00:05:48.481 --> 00:05:49.716 line:95%,end
It's very serious.

00:05:49.782 --> 00:05:50.616 line:95%,end
I am an artist.

00:05:50.683 --> 00:05:53.019 line:95%,end
And when it comes
to complicated choreography,

00:05:53.453 --> 00:05:55.488 line:95%,end
the children who are the dancers,

00:05:55.555 --> 00:05:57.957 line:95%,end
they need to become
artists, as well.

00:05:58.024 --> 00:05:59.625 line:95%,end
And I want to teach them

00:05:59.692 --> 00:06:01.894 line:95%,end
to convey the story

00:06:01.961 --> 00:06:04.063 line:95%,end
with their emotional execution,

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.998 line:95%,end
as well as their dance technique.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.003 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: So guess
what tomorrow is?

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.773 line:95%,end
Kelly's going to be 40!

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.509 line:95%,end
(cheering)

00:06:16.576 --> 00:06:18.544 line:95%,end
Lordy, lordy, look who's 40!

00:06:18.611 --> 00:06:20.613 line:95%,end
I don't quite know
how I feel turning 40.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:21.948 line:95%,end
I mean, I'm excited.

00:06:22.014 --> 00:06:23.683 line:95%,end
I think it's a new chapter of my life.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.119 line:95%,end
But then, when I think about, it
I think, oh, I'm so old.

00:06:26.185 --> 00:06:27.553 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I have something planned.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:28.588 line:95%,end
We're going to go to your house.

00:06:28.654 --> 00:06:31.057 line:95%,end
I'm going to bring some goodies
and some cocktails and...

00:06:31.124 --> 00:06:32.959 line:95%,end
-Aye, aye,
-...no babies.

00:06:33.025 --> 00:06:35.128 line:95%,end
I think that what you guys
should do tomorrow

00:06:35.194 --> 00:06:36.896 line:95%,end
is go get Botox.

00:06:36.963 --> 00:06:39.298 line:95%,end
-Anybody who's 40--
-CHRISTI: Oh, I love it!

00:06:39.365 --> 00:06:40.967 line:95%,end
Do I look that old?

00:06:41.033 --> 00:06:43.169 line:95%,end
CATHY: Anybody--well, right here--

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:45.071 line:95%,end
-anybody who's 40 needs to...
-CHRISTI: Yes!

00:06:45.138 --> 00:06:46.906 line:95%,end
-CATHY: ...start to think about that.
-KELLY: How rude!

00:06:46.973 --> 00:06:48.374 line:95%,end
CATHY: You could start
to get it underneath here

00:06:48.441 --> 00:06:49.742 line:95%,end
because it'll kind of, like...

00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:51.511 line:95%,end
I don't know
why Cathy is so insecure.

00:06:51.577 --> 00:06:53.679 line:95%,end
It might be
because she is older.

00:06:53.746 --> 00:06:54.914 line:95%,end
I mean, I think--doing the math,

00:06:54.981 --> 00:06:56.916 line:95%,end
I think Cathy may be old enough
to be my mother.

00:06:56.983 --> 00:06:59.085 line:95%,end
Well, I didn't think
I was that bad.

00:06:59.152 --> 00:07:00.052 line:95%,end
HOLLY: I like my wrinkles.

00:07:00.119 --> 00:07:01.287 line:95%,end
They add character.

00:07:01.354 --> 00:07:02.355 line:95%,end
KELLY: Good for you, Miss Holly.

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:03.990 line:95%,end
(interposing voices)

00:07:04.056 --> 00:07:05.658 line:95%,end
KELLY: I thought
I liked myself, too,

00:07:05.725 --> 00:07:07.393 line:95%,end
but obviously Cathy doesn't.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.428 line:95%,end
(laughter)

00:07:08.494 --> 00:07:10.596 line:5%,start
CATHY: Kelly is 40
and fabulous, for sure.

00:07:10.663 --> 00:07:13.966 line:5%,start
But she needs to start to really think

00:07:14.033 --> 00:07:15.535 line:95%,end
about some high end maintenance.

00:07:15.601 --> 00:07:17.703 line:95%,end
I'm only 34.
Do you think I need it?

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:19.539 line:95%,end
CATHY: Oh, yes. Yes.

00:07:19.605 --> 00:07:21.307 line:95%,end
That's where my personality
happens, up here,

00:07:21.374 --> 00:07:22.375 line:95%,end
because I'm always
making faces at people.

00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:23.643 line:95%,end
CATHY: And you know what?

00:07:23.709 --> 00:07:25.878 line:95%,end
Nobody wants to have
those frown lines.

00:07:25.945 --> 00:07:29.415 line:95%,end
CATHY: <i>Christie is a lot</i>
<i>younger than all of us.</i>

00:07:29.482 --> 00:07:32.919 line:95%,end
<i>And, honestly, she has</i>
<i>furrows so deep in her brow</i>

00:07:32.985 --> 00:07:35.588 line:95%,end
that, honest to gosh,
we could plant seeds in it

00:07:35.655 --> 00:07:37.557 line:95%,end
and she could have
a little bouquet there if we had to.

00:07:37.623 --> 00:07:39.892 line:95%,end
You've got the opportunity
to look better and look younger.

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:41.994 line:95%,end
-CHRISTI: Yeah, I agree.
-Why not take advantage of it?

00:07:42.061 --> 00:07:44.230 line:95%,end
I'm in.
I think we should do it.

00:07:45.398 --> 00:07:46.933 line:95%,end
MELISSA: No.
They're doing gym.

00:07:46.999 --> 00:07:48.701 line:95%,end
You know, I want--
I want Mackenzie to have fun.

00:07:48.768 --> 00:07:50.503 line:95%,end
Excuse me.
I'll be back.

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:53.840 line:95%,end
<i>I was incredibly</i>
<i>frustrated after chalkboard.</i>

00:07:53.906 --> 00:07:55.308 line:95%,end
I want the best for my daughter.

00:07:55.374 --> 00:07:57.443 line:95%,end
<i>I want her to shine</i>
<i>and have the same opportunities</i>

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:58.611 line:95%,end
<i>as the rest of the girls.</i>

00:07:58.678 --> 00:08:01.614 line:5%,start
Once again, Nia has been
passed over for a solo.

00:08:01.681 --> 00:08:05.251 line:5%,start
And I'm angry, I'm frustrated,
and I'm really disappointed.

00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:06.219 line:95%,end
I'm really sick of it.

00:08:06.285 --> 00:08:07.954 line:95%,end
-ABBY: I want group two.
-Can we speak for one second?

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:09.956 line:95%,end
-ABBY: Okay.
-Really quickly.

00:08:10.022 --> 00:08:14.627 line:95%,end
How come Nia doesn't have
a chance to do her solo?

00:08:14.694 --> 00:08:16.295 line:95%,end
She's not being stretched.
Because, as you said, like--

00:08:16.362 --> 00:08:17.830 line:95%,end
-the more exposure--
-Well, no. No, no, no. No, no, no.

00:08:17.897 --> 00:08:19.765 line:95%,end
And the thing is,
I don't want Nia to get to the point

00:08:19.832 --> 00:08:22.134 line:95%,end
where she thinks,
oh, I'm settling.

00:08:22.201 --> 00:08:23.903 line:95%,end
Oh, it's good I only do
two group numbers.

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:26.105 line:95%,end
All these moms
want their kid to be in the spotlight,

00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:27.273 line:95%,end
but it's just not that easy.

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:28.574 line:95%,end
It doesn't work that way.

00:08:28.641 --> 00:08:30.710 line:95%,end
Not everybody
can be in the spotlight.

00:08:30.776 --> 00:08:32.311 line:95%,end
You have to have the talent.

00:08:32.378 --> 00:08:34.080 line:95%,end
And some have it and some don't.

00:08:34.146 --> 00:08:35.681 line:95%,end
I want her to feel successful.

00:08:35.748 --> 00:08:37.183 line:95%,end
I want her to feel wanted.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:38.918 line:95%,end
I want you in there
with her private lessons.

00:08:38.985 --> 00:08:40.486 line:95%,end
I told you that
several weeks ago.

00:08:40.553 --> 00:08:41.854 line:95%,end
It's the ballet technique.

00:08:41.921 --> 00:08:44.924 line:95%,end
So it's over and over and over
and Nia, come on!

00:08:44.991 --> 00:08:46.359 line:95%,end
Wake up!
What are you doing?

00:08:46.425 --> 00:08:48.294 line:95%,end
HOLLY: <i>And it's frustrating</i>
<i>because she doesn't hear me.</i>

00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:50.429 line:95%,end
I feel like I'm not being heard,
and she just gives me

00:08:50.496 --> 00:08:53.032 line:95%,end
whatever answers
that are hollow.

00:08:53.099 --> 00:08:55.134 line:95%,end
They-they don't have
any meaning to them.

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:56.435 line:95%,end
She's just trying to shut me up.

00:08:56.502 --> 00:08:58.905 line:95%,end
ABBY: It's not about
how many dances is this kid in

00:08:58.971 --> 00:09:00.706 line:95%,end
and how many is that,
and how much is this person paying

00:09:00.773 --> 00:09:01.841 line:95%,end
and how much is that.

00:09:01.908 --> 00:09:04.010 line:95%,end
Really, Holly,
that has very little to do with it.

00:09:04.076 --> 00:09:05.278 line:95%,end
I don't want you coming
back in and saying...

00:09:05.344 --> 00:09:06.479 line:95%,end
-I don't.
-ABBY: ...you're too tough on her.

00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:07.780 line:95%,end
-I don't.
-ABBY: I want her to know--

00:09:07.847 --> 00:09:10.883 line:95%,end
duet, trio,
is it worth doing the--

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:12.852 line:95%,end
putting the time
and the energy in.

00:09:12.919 --> 00:09:14.120 line:95%,end
I want to see action.

00:09:14.186 --> 00:09:16.289 line:95%,end
Words are lovely,
but I want to see action.

00:09:16.355 --> 00:09:19.258 line:95%,end
I want to see some type
of commitment to Nia.

00:09:19.325 --> 00:09:21.260 line:95%,end
Whatever will get her
to that winning place is what--

00:09:21.327 --> 00:09:22.161 line:95%,end
-Okay.
-Exactly.

00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:23.062 line:95%,end
-That's what we need.
-All right.

00:09:23.129 --> 00:09:24.764 line:95%,end
Nia is a good dancer.

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:26.432 line:95%,end
But is she great?

00:09:26.499 --> 00:09:27.333 line:95%,end
Not yet.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.569 line:95%,end
These moms think
that everything should be fair,

00:09:29.635 --> 00:09:31.170 line:95%,end
but it's not fair.

00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:32.238 line:95%,end
Life isn't fair.

00:09:32.305 --> 00:09:33.973 line:95%,end
Every competition
has different rules,

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.708 line:95%,end
different age categories,

00:09:35.775 --> 00:09:38.578 line:95%,end
and I want to put the kids
in that are going to win.


00:09:42.782 --> 00:09:45.585 line:95%,end
(jolly music playing)

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.156 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>We're coming today</i>
<i>to get injections for our wrinkles,</i>

00:09:50.222 --> 00:09:51.457 line:5%,start
because Cathy seemed to think

00:09:51.524 --> 00:09:54.260 line:5%,start
that Christi and I
needed some improvements.

00:09:54.327 --> 00:09:56.195 line:95%,end
And since
it was my 40th birthday,

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:57.964 line:95%,end
we decided that we would
come and do it today.

00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:59.198 line:95%,end
Here we go.

00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:01.167 line:95%,end
Kind of--it looks like
a dentist's office.

00:10:01.233 --> 00:10:02.568 line:95%,end
-MOMS: Oh!
-Well, I'm not a big fan

00:10:02.635 --> 00:10:03.736 line:95%,end
-of the dentist, either.
-Ew!

00:10:03.803 --> 00:10:05.404 line:95%,end
I don't like the way it looks.

00:10:05.471 --> 00:10:06.772 line:95%,end
-(Christi gasps)
-Oh, my God.

00:10:06.839 --> 00:10:09.308 line:95%,end
Look at those needles.
Oh, I'm scared!

00:10:09.375 --> 00:10:10.476 line:95%,end
Yeah, I'm very nervous.

00:10:10.543 --> 00:10:11.944 line:95%,end
I'm afraid of side effects,

00:10:12.011 --> 00:10:15.114 line:95%,end
like they say you can have
droopy eyelid and things like that.

00:10:15.181 --> 00:10:17.516 line:95%,end
And I'm just hoping
that everything turns out okay.

00:10:18.117 --> 00:10:19.785 line:95%,end
DOCTOR:
Just take a deep breath.

00:10:19.852 --> 00:10:20.953 line:95%,end
Relax.

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.888 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: This is
where we needed cocktails.

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:25.891 line:95%,end
Kelly, you're so brave.

00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.159 line:95%,end
Oh, Kelly.

00:10:27.226 --> 00:10:29.161 line:95%,end
I'm nervous, guys!

00:10:29.228 --> 00:10:31.163 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Oh,
it's going to be easy.

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:32.131 line:95%,end
DOCTOR: Go ahead and frown.

00:10:32.198 --> 00:10:33.099 line:95%,end
Frown, frown, frown.

00:10:33.165 --> 00:10:35.601 line:95%,end
It's going to be
three quick pinches.

00:10:36.235 --> 00:10:37.269 line:95%,end
You okay?

00:10:37.336 --> 00:10:38.971 line:95%,end
CATHY: That was quick!

00:10:39.038 --> 00:10:40.406 line:95%,end
DOCTOR: Did it hurt?

00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:41.974 line:95%,end
Not at lot, like a bee sting.

00:10:42.041 --> 00:10:44.343 line:95%,end
Oh, in my face. okay.

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:45.878 line:95%,end
KELLY: If I could handle it...

00:10:45.945 --> 00:10:47.013 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>Kelly went first.</i>

00:10:47.079 --> 00:10:49.281 line:5%,start
And as I'm watching her,
I'm starting to panic

00:10:49.348 --> 00:10:51.117 line:5%,start
because it looks very painful.

00:10:51.183 --> 00:10:52.618 line:95%,end
<i>They're going to stick</i>
<i>needles in my face.</i>

00:10:52.685 --> 00:10:55.154 line:95%,end
I don't like needles in my arm,
let alone in my face.

00:10:55.221 --> 00:10:58.758 line:95%,end
She has tons of wrinkles
for being only 34.

00:10:58.824 --> 00:11:01.427 line:95%,end
-She really needs help.
-KELLY: You have tons.

00:11:01.494 --> 00:11:03.329 line:95%,end
I have these lines, here.

00:11:03.396 --> 00:11:05.865 line:95%,end
I guess I scowl a lot
and I raise my eyebrows.

00:11:05.931 --> 00:11:08.868 line:95%,end
And, you know, it's just kind
of part of my personality.

00:11:08.934 --> 00:11:10.336 line:95%,end
<i>But everybody always</i>
<i>thinks I'm mad.</i>

00:11:11.003 --> 00:11:12.772 line:95%,end
I'm really not.
So I guess I have mean eyes.

00:11:12.838 --> 00:11:14.540 line:95%,end
DOCTOR: A little pinch. Ready?

00:11:14.607 --> 00:11:16.208 line:95%,end
Right between the brows, here.

00:11:18.377 --> 00:11:20.646 line:95%,end
KELLY: A lot of those wrinkles.
Yeah. It's not too bad, huh?

00:11:20.713 --> 00:11:21.714 line:95%,end
I can't believe how fast it is.

00:11:21.781 --> 00:11:24.350 line:95%,end
I know. That's why people do it
on their lunch hour.

00:11:24.417 --> 00:11:25.651 line:95%,end
I'll be back tomorrow.

00:11:25.718 --> 00:11:26.719 line:95%,end
It didn't really even hurt.

00:11:26.786 --> 00:11:29.455 line:95%,end
I think it hurts more
to get your ears pierced.

00:11:29.522 --> 00:11:30.990 line:95%,end
I was happily surprised.

00:11:31.057 --> 00:11:33.893 line:95%,end
So a couple little pricks
and off we go.

00:11:33.959 --> 00:11:36.962 line:95%,end
(laughs) I'm afraid
I'm losing my mind.

00:11:37.029 --> 00:11:38.831 line:95%,end
-KELLY: <i>Oh, that was great.</i>
-CHRISTI: <i>How exciting!</i>

00:11:40.299 --> 00:11:41.934 line:5%,start
ABBY: <i>Good morning, ladies.</i>

00:11:42.001 --> 00:11:43.636 line:95%,end
Everybody ready to go?

00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:44.937 line:95%,end
This is regionals.

00:11:45.004 --> 00:11:46.105 line:95%,end
You know how important it is.

00:11:46.172 --> 00:11:48.741 line:5%,start
All of the experience the kids
have had competing

00:11:48.808 --> 00:11:52.511 line:5%,start
weekend after weekend
is all leading up to this point.

00:11:52.578 --> 00:11:54.980 line:95%,end
So we want to go
to Providence,

00:11:55.047 --> 00:11:57.783 line:95%,end
we want to put our best foot forward
and come out on top.

00:11:57.850 --> 00:11:59.518 line:95%,end

00:12:09.495 --> 00:12:11.831 line:5%,start
For regionals,
Maddie is doing a routine

00:12:11.897 --> 00:12:13.499 line:95%,end
to the music "Beautiful."

00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:16.268 line:95%,end
It's a lyrical,
contemporary piece,

00:12:16.335 --> 00:12:19.805 line:95%,end
turns, jumps, leaps,
what she does best.

00:12:19.872 --> 00:12:22.541 line:95%,end

MADDIE: <i>I always win first too</i>

00:12:27.346 --> 00:12:29.882 line:5%,start
because I work really hard
in classes.

00:12:29.949 --> 00:12:33.219 line:95%,end
And I'm usually against,
like, seven-year-olds.

00:12:33.285 --> 00:12:35.554 line:95%,end
<i>There's a lot of times</i>
<i>when I get bumped up</i>

00:12:35.621 --> 00:12:37.356 line:95%,end
and I still get first place,

00:12:37.423 --> 00:12:39.091 line:95%,end

you have a new routine.

Yes?

00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:45.998 line:95%,end
What do you think
the judges are looking for?

00:12:46.332 --> 00:12:47.333 line:95%,end
Technique.

00:12:47.399 --> 00:12:48.768 line:95%,end
Right.
And technique means

00:12:48.834 --> 00:12:51.170 line:95%,end
all the hours you spend
in ballet class,

00:12:51.237 --> 00:12:53.405 line:95%,end
every pliÃ©, every relevÃ©,

00:12:53.472 --> 00:12:55.307 line:95%,end
you need to rely
on your technique.


00:12:55.374 --> 00:12:57.276 line:95%,end
Yes? Any questions?

00:12:57.343 --> 00:12:59.245 line:95%,end
No?
Anything you want to go over?

00:12:59.311 --> 00:13:00.246 line:95%,end
It's good?

00:13:00.312 --> 00:13:01.380 line:95%,end
Okay.

00:13:01.447 --> 00:13:02.748 line:95%,end

called "Parlez Moi."

00:13:19.098 --> 00:13:20.966 line:5%,start
And it's a little cute French dance

00:13:21.033 --> 00:13:22.201 line:5%,start
and uses personality.

00:13:22.268 --> 00:13:23.435 line:95%,end
And I really like it.

One, two, three, four, five.

How's the baby girl?

Hello!
Did you get a haircut?

Did you get a haircut?
I heard!

absolutely wonderful.

All the way around, go.

00:14:05.277 --> 00:14:06.345 line:95%,end

-Mm-hmm.

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:20.092 line:95%,end
I feel bad that you
didn't get it done, though.

00:14:20.159 --> 00:14:21.493 line:95%,end
I didn't need it, girls.

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.929 line:95%,end

-CATHY: You sure did, that's right.

00:14:23.996 --> 00:14:25.464 line:95%,end
KELLY: Yeah.
Never had any intentions

00:14:25.531 --> 00:14:27.299 line:95%,end
of getting Botox until we met her.

00:14:27.366 --> 00:14:28.801 line:95%,end
Yeah. But I can tell you right now,

00:14:28.868 --> 00:14:30.302 line:95%,end
you are going to be junkies with it.

00:14:30.369 --> 00:14:32.638 line:95%,end
-So you're good.
-I better keep getting Botox.

00:14:32.705 --> 00:14:34.573 line:95%,end

Cathy kept telling me
all the other cosmetic procedures

00:14:46.018 --> 00:14:47.753 line:5%,start
I needed,
like I needed a nose job.

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:49.788 line:95%,end
Thank you, Cathy.
I'm quite comfortable with the way I look.

00:14:53.792 --> 00:14:55.327 line:95%,end
you'd think she would
have grown up by now.

Do you guys golf?

00:14:57.196 --> 00:14:58.864 line:95%,end

00:14:58.931 --> 00:15:00.399 line:95%,end
-What?
-Oh, my God.

00:15:00.466 --> 00:15:01.500 line:95%,end
What?

00:15:02.401 --> 00:15:04.603 line:95%,end
My grandmother just got
rushed to the hospital, again.

00:15:06.138 --> 00:15:08.207 line:95%,end
During lunch,
I got a text message

00:15:08.274 --> 00:15:11.343 line:95%,end
that my grandmother
was taken back to the hospital, again.

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:12.978 line:95%,end
CATHY: What's going on with her?

00:15:13.045 --> 00:15:14.113 line:95%,end
Has she had problems?

00:15:14.179 --> 00:15:19.018 line:95%,end
Yeah.
She's 87 and she has,

00:15:19.084 --> 00:15:20.586 line:95%,end
like, COPD

00:15:20.653 --> 00:15:23.155 line:95%,end
-and congestive heart failure.
-CATHY: Oh, God.

00:15:23.222 --> 00:15:24.423 line:95%,end
I am very close to her,

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:26.425 line:95%,end
and I was very close
to my grandfather, as well.

00:15:26.492 --> 00:15:29.461 line:95%,end
So when you get that news
it's not the same as somebody saying,

00:15:29.528 --> 00:15:30.529 line:95%,end
<i>like, oh, your grandmother is sick.</i>

00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:33.098 line:95%,end

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.035 line:95%,end
Why is she like your mom?

00:15:36.101 --> 00:15:39.038 line:95%,end
I don't have a good relationship
with my mother.

00:15:39.104 --> 00:15:42.141 line:95%,end
My mother had me
when she was very young.

00:15:42.207 --> 00:15:46.679 line:95%,end
And my grandparents
were my parents, more or less.

00:15:46.745 --> 00:15:48.547 line:95%,end
You may just have to go to her

00:15:48.614 --> 00:15:52.084 line:95%,end
instead of your other obligations
at the dance studio.

00:15:52.151 --> 00:15:53.052 line:95%,end
Yeah.

00:15:53.686 --> 00:15:55.854 line:95%,end
Going in the hospital
is not uncommon for her.

00:15:55.921 --> 00:15:57.957 line:95%,end
But something about this
one felt a little different.

00:15:58.023 --> 00:15:59.325 line:95%,end

I got to go.

Yeah. My house is right here,

You look fine.

<i>She just didn't want</i>
<i>Brooke to wear the costume.</i>

00:31:55.647 --> 00:31:57.081 line:95%,end
I just think it was totally wrong,

00:31:57.148 --> 00:31:58.416 line:95%,end
and very unfair to my daughter.

00:31:58.483 --> 00:31:59.684 line:95%,end

Why are you crying?

<i>when we walked</i>
<i>into our dressing rooms,</i>

00:33:54.966 --> 00:33:57.668 line:95%,end
I had no idea
where my costume was.

00:33:57.735 --> 00:34:00.138 line:95%,end
Where's your mom?
Because I need my top.

00:34:00.204 --> 00:34:03.641 line:95%,end
Last night I told Kelly
that she had to fix Vivi's costume

00:34:03.708 --> 00:34:04.909 line:95%,end
since she tore it to pieces.

00:34:04.976 --> 00:34:08.446 line:95%,end
And she was still working
on sewing the rhinestones on.

-CATHY: Vivi dances at 10:22.

CATHY: And I'm not--
I'm not like you guys.

00:34:12.617 --> 00:34:15.386 line:95%,end
I don't run to the stage after her
with a darning needle.

00:34:15.453 --> 00:34:16.621 line:95%,end
I will have it ready.

00:34:16.687 --> 00:34:18.623 line:95%,end
But I'm not like you,
who takes it from the kid five minutes

00:34:18.689 --> 00:34:19.957 line:95%,end
before they go onstage.

00:34:20.024 --> 00:34:21.159 line:95%,end
Maybe that's when
I should give you yours.

CATHY: I'm a lot more
prepared than you are.

00:34:23.294 --> 00:34:25.797 line:95%,end
So, Brooke,
did you do well last night?

00:34:25.863 --> 00:34:27.398 line:95%,end
Oh, congratulations, Brooke.
I'm sorry.

00:34:27.465 --> 00:34:28.800 line:95%,end
Oh, she got sixth.

00:34:28.866 --> 00:34:29.700 line:95%,end
Ooh.

00:34:29.767 --> 00:34:30.601 line:95%,end
Yeah.

00:34:30.668 --> 00:34:32.837 line:95%,end
Brooke won sixth place

00:34:33.504 --> 00:34:35.973 line:95%,end
not because of the costume.

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:38.142 line:95%,end
Because there were
five other girls

00:34:38.209 --> 00:34:39.510 line:95%,end
that were better than her.

00:34:41.045 --> 00:34:42.280 line:95%,end
All right, Cathy,
here's your costume.

00:34:42.346 --> 00:34:44.615 line:95%,end
I hope the rhinestones
give your daughter some luck.

00:34:44.949 --> 00:34:46.384 line:95%,end
<i>I hate Cathy.</i>

00:34:46.451 --> 00:34:48.619 line:95%,end

<i>Vivi's costume.</i>

<i>You couldn't tell</i>
<i>I had touched it, at all.</i>

00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:53.324 line:95%,end
Cathy just needs
to keep her mouth shut.

00:34:56.861 --> 00:34:59.197 line:95%,end
Have you heard anything
about your grandma?

00:34:59.831 --> 00:35:00.698 line:95%,end
No.

00:35:00.765 --> 00:35:03.568 line:95%,end
And, you know, I'm kind
of looking at it like,

00:35:03.634 --> 00:35:06.204 line:95%,end
-you know, no news is good news.
-Yeah.

00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:09.340 line:95%,end
I can't allow myself
to think like, you know,

00:35:09.407 --> 00:35:10.608 line:95%,end
that she's mortal

00:35:10.675 --> 00:35:12.110 line:95%,end
and that someday
she's not going to be here.

00:35:12.176 --> 00:35:14.312 line:95%,end
-I mean, I--
-Yeah. I mean, she is, what, 80...

-Seven.

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:18.449 line:95%,end

-CHRISTI: But I need her.

00:35:18.516 --> 00:35:19.684 line:95%,end
-KELLY: I know.
-Like, she's my mom.

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:22.019 line:95%,end
Like, I need her.
I'm not ready not to have my mom.

00:35:22.753 --> 00:35:24.489 line:95%,end
Let me see if I can call her.

00:35:24.555 --> 00:35:26.090 line:95%,end

Aw.

Choreographically,

I don't know.
It's just plain creepy.

<i>Where have</i>

00:38:12.556 --> 00:38:15.960 line:95%,end
<i>Just yesterday</i>
<i>they were tying ribbons in trees</i>

00:38:16.027 --> 00:38:18.763 line:95%,end
<i>and swinging from the branches.</i>

00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:22.533 line:95%,end
<i>Maybe this is just a dream.</i>

00:38:23.467 --> 00:38:28.039 line:95%,end
<i>Maybe they're sleeping in rooms</i>

00:38:28.105 --> 00:38:31.676 line:95%,end
<i>filled with metal shelves.</i>

00:38:31.742 --> 00:38:34.779 line:95%,end
<i>If we put our ears</i>
<i>to those shelves,</i>

00:38:34.845 --> 00:38:39.483 line:95%,end
<i>where have all</i>
<i>the children gone?</i>

00:38:40.718 --> 00:38:44.889 line:95%,end
<i>But we know</i>
<i>this is really happening.</i>

00:38:46.691 --> 00:38:51.462 line:95%,end
<i>Where have</i>
<i>all the children gone?</i>

00:38:52.697 --> 00:38:54.398 line:95%,end
(cheering and applause)

00:38:54.465 --> 00:38:55.499 line:95%,end
HOLLY: <i>The dance was amazing,</i>

00:38:56.534 --> 00:38:59.203 line:95%,end
although disturbing.
I'm glad my child was a part of that.

00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:01.138 line:95%,end
<i>It really did stretch her,</i>
<i>as a dancer.</i>

00:39:02.106 --> 00:39:04.175 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>I don't think</i>
<i>that anyone would say</i>

00:39:04.241 --> 00:39:06.177 line:95%,end
<i>it's too heavy and too mature.</i>

00:39:06.243 --> 00:39:08.512 line:95%,end
<i>Now maybe some</i>
<i>of the moms thought that,</i>

00:39:08.579 --> 00:39:10.781 line:5%,start
but once again,
I'm not out to please the moms.

00:39:10.848 --> 00:39:12.316 line:5%,start
I'm out to please the judges.

00:39:12.383 --> 00:39:13.884 line:5%,start
ANNOUNCER: <i>We're going to find</i>
<i>out the 11 and under</i>

00:39:13.951 --> 00:39:15.686 line:5%,start
<i>highest scoring routine of the day.</i>

00:39:18.022 --> 00:39:20.658 line:95%,end
<i>If we were at nationals,</i>
<i>this would be your 11 and under</i>

00:39:20.725 --> 00:39:23.227 line:95%,end
<i>Victory Cup winner.</i>

00:39:23.294 --> 00:39:25.262 line:95%,end
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>the highest scoring routine</i>

00:39:25.329 --> 00:39:27.031 line:95%,end
<i>of the day went to...</i>

00:39:30.201 --> 00:39:33.971 line:95%,end
<i>entry number 250,</i>
<i>"Where Have All the Children Gone?"</i>

00:39:34.038 --> 00:39:37.141 line:95%,end
<i>Congratulations, guys, all of you.</i>

00:39:37.208 --> 00:39:40.111 line:95%,end
<i>Congratulations goes to you.</i>

00:39:40.177 --> 00:39:41.712 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>I questioned</i>
<i>the dance from the beginning,</i>

00:39:41.779 --> 00:39:44.382 line:95%,end
but Abby was right.
She pulled it off.

00:39:44.448 --> 00:39:46.317 line:95%,end
ANNOUNCER: <i>Good job!</i>
<i>Take a bow! Thank you, girls!</i>

00:39:46.384 --> 00:39:48.352 line:95%,end
MELISSA: <i>Our girls</i>
<i>did qualify for nationals,</i>

00:39:48.419 --> 00:39:50.688 line:95%,end
so we are going to nationals.

00:39:51.722 --> 00:39:53.958 line:95%,end
ABBY:
<i>There were over 280 acts,</i>

00:39:54.024 --> 00:39:55.793 line:95%,end
<i>and they were first,</i>

00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:58.796 line:95%,end
<i>the highest scoring number</i>
<i>in the entire competition.</i>

00:39:58.863 --> 00:40:00.131 line:95%,end
I knew this would be a risk,

00:40:00.197 --> 00:40:03.300 line:95%,end
but it was definitely a risk
I was willing to take.

00:40:03.367 --> 00:40:06.504 line:95%,end
<i>It made everybody stop</i>
<i>and pay attention to my dancers.</i>

00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:08.205 line:95%,end
I'm Abby Lee Miller.
That's what I do.

00:40:08.272 --> 00:40:10.908 line:95%,end
Congratulations!

00:40:10.975 --> 00:40:12.576 line:95%,end
-(cheering and applause)
-Aren't you guys so excited?

00:40:12.643 --> 00:40:15.112 line:95%,end
Oh, I'm so proud of all of you!

00:40:15.179 --> 00:40:17.348 line:5%,start
<i>The girls won the top award</i>
<i>that you could win,</i>

00:40:17.415 --> 00:40:18.616 line:5%,start
<i>and they deserved it.</i>

00:40:18.682 --> 00:40:20.651 line:5%,start
Things are looking
really good for nationals.

00:40:20.718 --> 00:40:22.553 line:5%,start
Now I have a better idea
of what we're going to take.

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:24.855 line:5%,start
We just need to figure out
how we're going to get that swing there.

00:40:24.922 --> 00:40:25.890 line:5%,start
<i>But this isn't the end.</i>

00:40:25.956 --> 00:40:27.158 line:5%,start
<i>It's only the beginning.</i>

00:40:27.224 --> 00:40:29.927 line:5%,start
We have a long road
before we get to nationals.

00:40:29.994 --> 00:40:32.863 line:5%,start
(cheering)

00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:34.765 line:5%,start
ABBY: All right. I'm think...

00:40:35.366 --> 00:40:36.600 line:5%,start
Can we go to the mall now?

00:40:36.667 --> 00:40:38.569 line:5%,start
-Yes. I think you can go to the mall now.
-Yes!

00:40:38.636 --> 00:40:41.138 line:5%,start
ABBY: <i>They think things</i>
<i>are tough now, but just wait.</i>

00:40:41.205 --> 00:40:43.007 line:5%,start
Things are about
to get a lot tougher.

00:40:43.073 --> 00:40:44.108 line:5%,start
Let's go.
