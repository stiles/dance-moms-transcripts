ABBY: Welcome to Las Vegas.

00:00:05.271 --> 00:00:07.240 line:5%,start
CATHY: <i>Candy Apples Dance Center</i>

00:00:07.307 --> 00:00:09.109 line:5%,start
<i>with the Abby Lee dancers at a competition</i>

00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:10.577 line:5%,start
<i>and we're going to go head to head.</i>

00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:12.979 line:5%,start
ALL: Hollywood here we come.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.815 line:5%,start
She looks like she has (bleep)
on the bottom of her pants.

00:00:15.882 --> 00:00:18.651 line:5%,start
Everybody gets a new costume
every week and I get (bleep).

00:00:18.718 --> 00:00:21.121 line:5%,start
<i>I'm using a hotel chair, for God sakes.</i>

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:22.455 line:5%,start
But if this was anybody else,

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:26.059 line:5%,start
they'd have a hot pink (bleep) chair
with rhinestones all over it.

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:28.661 line:5%,start
ABBY: <i>Coming up on </i>Dance Moms.

00:00:28.728 --> 00:00:31.664 line:5%,start
Ladies, here we are
in Los Angeles, California,

00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:33.967 line:5%,start
the city of dreams.

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:35.335 line:5%,start
(screaming)

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:37.704 line:5%,start
Surprise.

00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:39.539 line:5%,start
-Hi everybody.
-What are you doing here?

00:00:39.606 --> 00:00:43.443 line:5%,start
Alls I want is for my kids
to get good choreography.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.180 line:5%,start
For you to be unhappy
with your choreography is a joke.

00:00:47.847 --> 00:00:49.015 line:5%,start
ABBY: <i>Right in the middle of rehearsal</i>

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:50.517 line:5%,start
<i>I get a phone call from my mom.</i>

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:53.520 line:5%,start
I am here and my mother is in a hospital.

00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:56.423 line:5%,start
How about if you do this dance
for Ms. Miller?

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.490 line:5%,start
Okay

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:03.196 line:95%,end

00:01:21.848 --> 00:01:22.849 line:95%,end
Thank you

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:23.983 line:95%,end
Finally.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.886 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>While we're here,</i>
<i>we rented the same studio</i>

00:01:26.953 --> 00:01:29.989 line:5%,start
<i>that Britney Spears</i>
<i>and Lady Gaga rehearse in.</i>

00:01:30.056 --> 00:01:31.791 line:5%,start
Nothing's too good for my girls.

(blows whistle)

00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:37.030 line:95%,end
Let's go, come on, no time to waste.

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:40.533 line:95%,end
Ladies, here we are
in Los Angeles, California,

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.670 line:95%,end
for the <i>iHollywood</i> national finals.

00:01:43.736 --> 00:01:47.040 line:95%,end
And you are in the city of dreams.

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:49.375 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>LA is our last competition</i>
<i>before the final nationals,</i>

00:01:49.442 --> 00:01:50.877 line:5%,start
of course we want to do well here.

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:53.413 line:5%,start
We want to set the tone for what
we're going to do in Tahoe.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.983 line:95%,end
There are going to be children
that you recognize.

00:01:57.484 --> 00:01:59.219 line:95%,end
The kids that are in movies.

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:00.820 line:95%,end
The kids that are on television.

00:02:00.887 --> 00:02:04.958 line:95%,end
These kids here in Los Angeles
audition on a weekly basis.

00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:06.593 line:95%,end
They are pros.

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.095 line:95%,end
<i>iHollywood</i> is relatively small

00:02:09.162 --> 00:02:13.099 line:95%,end
because it draws a very
select group of people.

00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:16.269 line:95%,end
<i>People that really want to work</i>
<i>professionally in the industry.</i>

00:02:16.336 --> 00:02:19.606 line:95%,end
So the competition
is very small but fierce.

00:02:19.672 --> 00:02:21.941 line:95%,end
Maddie, your mom's not here again.

00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:23.510 line:95%,end
We all make choices.

00:02:23.576 --> 00:02:26.446 line:95%,end
She chose to be away
instead of being here with you.

00:02:26.513 --> 00:02:28.148 line:95%,end
<i>Melissa's not here at </i>iHollywood.

00:02:28.214 --> 00:02:29.816 line:95%,end
<i>She's spending time with her boyfriend.</i>

00:02:29.883 --> 00:02:32.719 line:95%,end
All of those things that go
into motherhood,

00:02:32.785 --> 00:02:35.922 line:95%,end
those are the things that Melissa
trusts me with her children.

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.158 line:95%,end
So the two of you are going
to be with me this week.

00:02:38.224 --> 00:02:40.727 line:95%,end
And you may get to do things
that everybody else doesn't get to do.

00:02:40.793 --> 00:02:42.495 line:95%,end
HOLLY: <i>Melissa not being here is weird.</i>

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:44.497 line:5%,start
I mean, we're in Hollywood.

00:02:44.564 --> 00:02:46.199 line:5%,start
She should be here with Maddie.

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:48.368 line:95%,end
I'm going to move on
to our lovely pyramid.

00:02:48.434 --> 00:02:51.237 line:95%,end
In the bottom row and I have...

00:02:51.304 --> 00:02:53.540 line:95%,end
(dramatic music playing)

00:02:53.606 --> 00:02:56.442 line:95%,end
ABBY: Paige and Brooke,
you will not be doing solos.

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:57.911 line:95%,end
You will be in the group number.

00:02:57.977 --> 00:02:59.679 line:95%,end
Now, I've had it out with your mom.

00:02:59.746 --> 00:03:00.580 line:95%,end
You know what?

00:03:00.647 --> 00:03:02.549 line:95%,end
From now on, get your own costumes made.

00:03:02.615 --> 00:03:03.750 line:95%,end
I'll draw the sketch.

00:03:03.816 --> 00:03:05.451 line:95%,end
Well then you have to hire
the choreographer.

00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:06.653 line:95%,end
-KELLY: Fine.
-ABBY: Fine.

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:10.123 line:95%,end
She has told me that she can find
better choreographers.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.524 line:95%,end
I'm sure she can.

00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:13.560 line:95%,end
This is Los Angeles,
this isn't Pittsburgh.

00:03:13.626 --> 00:03:15.895 line:95%,end
<i>I have made it perfectly clear.</i>

00:03:15.962 --> 00:03:19.265 line:95%,end
If Kelly wants her kids to do
independently choreographed solos,

00:03:19.332 --> 00:03:20.967 line:95%,end
she's not a part of the group number.

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:24.437 line:95%,end
<i>So if Kelly wants to go ahead</i>
<i>and enter Paige as an independent soloist</i>

00:03:24.504 --> 00:03:26.739 line:95%,end
<i>then Paige is out of the group number.</i>

00:03:26.806 --> 00:03:29.776 line:95%,end
But please understand,
if you go as an independent

00:03:29.842 --> 00:03:31.377 line:95%,end
you're out, you're finished.

00:03:31.945 --> 00:03:35.448 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>We're here in Hollywood</i>
<i>and this is an important competition.</i>

00:03:35.515 --> 00:03:38.251 line:95%,end
<i>And Abby thinks that it's okay</i>
<i>for Paige not to have a solo.</i>

00:03:38.318 --> 00:03:39.586 line:5%,start
I mean, it's just ridiculous.

00:03:39.652 --> 00:03:40.787 line:5%,start
Paige is in Hollywood.

00:03:40.853 --> 00:03:41.688 line:5%,start
She needs a solo.

00:03:41.754 --> 00:03:42.822 line:95%,end
She needs to be seen.

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.658 line:95%,end
So if I have to hire somebody
to choreograph a solo her

00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:47.093 line:95%,end
then that's what I'm going to do.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.496 line:95%,end
Next I have Nia, Mackenzie duet.

00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:52.599 line:95%,end
(clapping)

00:03:52.665 --> 00:03:56.402 line:95%,end
So Chloe, you're going to be doing
a solo as well as the group routine.

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:58.605 line:95%,end
And no surprise,

00:03:59.105 --> 00:04:01.507 line:95%,end
Maddie, you're going to be doing
a solo this week.


00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:04.244 line:95%,end
Now remember, you are undefeated.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.645 line:95%,end
People are out to get you.

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:07.847 line:95%,end
You're the one to beat.

00:04:08.181 --> 00:04:11.117 line:95%,end
<i>I put Maddie back on top because</i>
<i>we need to get back to winning.</i>

00:04:11.184 --> 00:04:13.419 line:95%,end
She is the glue that holds
that group together.

00:04:13.486 --> 00:04:17.657 line:95%,end
Does everybody understand
how big of an opportunity this is?

00:04:17.724 --> 00:04:20.493 line:95%,end
Those judges at <i>iHollywood </i>are going

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.931 line:95%,end
to be people that are
in a capacity to hire you.

00:04:24.998 --> 00:04:28.468 line:95%,end
They are the people that choreograph
for television and for film.

00:04:28.534 --> 00:04:32.805 line:95%,end
So it's very important that
you step on stage like pros.

00:04:32.872 --> 00:04:33.806 line:95%,end
Do you understand?

00:04:33.873 --> 00:04:34.707 line:95%,end
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:04:34.774 --> 00:04:35.775 line:95%,end
ABBY: All right, let's go.

00:04:35.842 --> 00:04:39.212 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:46.052 line:5%,start
ABBY: <i>We're good,</i>
<i>let's see it from the top.</i>

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:47.220 line:5%,start
(upbeat music playing)

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:49.355 line:5%,start
GIANNA: Pick a judge
and stare at them on that.

00:04:49.422 --> 00:04:50.423 line:5%,start
ABBY: Stare at them.

00:04:50.857 --> 00:04:52.925 line:5%,start
<i>"My Pumps" is the group routine.</i>

00:04:52.992 --> 00:04:54.060 line:95%,end
<i>It's fun.</i>

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:55.028 line:95%,end
<i>It's artistic.</i>

00:04:55.094 --> 00:04:57.730 line:95%,end
<i>It's very LA, Hollywood.</i>

00:04:57.797 --> 00:05:00.233 line:95%,end
<i>There's some sharp</i>
<i>little tweaky stuff in it.</i>

00:05:00.833 --> 00:05:03.269 line:95%,end
<i>Brooke and Paige are involved</i>
<i>in a group routine.</i>

00:05:03.336 --> 00:05:05.938 line:95%,end
<i>Kelly can go ahead and try</i>
<i>to enter them as an independent,</i>

00:05:06.005 --> 00:05:07.640 line:95%,end
<i>and do some other choreographer's routine</i>

00:05:07.707 --> 00:05:09.075 line:95%,end
<i>that I've never even seen before.</i>

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:11.277 line:95%,end
But then they can't be in the group dance

00:05:11.344 --> 00:05:13.112 line:95%,end
and they're not part
of the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.916 line:95%,end
KELLY: How about Abby taking care
of Maddie and MacKenzie?

00:05:17.417 --> 00:05:20.186 line:95%,end
And her saying, you might do
more things than the group.

00:05:20.253 --> 00:05:22.255 line:95%,end
Well you know what the hell
that's going to be.

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:24.524 line:95%,end
-I know what that going to be.
-Like she's going to be taking them out--

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.025 line:95%,end
-To be seen.
-CHRISTI: Oh, yeah.

00:05:26.092 --> 00:05:29.228 line:95%,end
Getting their name out in LA,
while we sit at the pool.

00:05:29.295 --> 00:05:30.763 line:95%,end
<i>With Melissa being on this week</i>

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.232 line:95%,end
<i>and Abby taking care</i>
<i>of Maddie and MacKenzie</i>

00:05:33.299 --> 00:05:36.035 line:95%,end
<i>those girls are going to get</i>
<i>way more attention from Abby</i>

00:05:36.102 --> 00:05:38.137 line:95%,end
<i>than normal, if that's even possible.</i>

00:05:38.204 --> 00:05:41.708 line:95%,end
I really am still surprised
that she picked her boyfriend

00:05:41.774 --> 00:05:43.042 line:95%,end
<i>over her kids.</i>

00:05:43.109 --> 00:05:44.944 line:95%,end
<i>Like her kids are eight and seven.</i>

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:46.145 line:95%,end
That's pretty big.

00:05:46.212 --> 00:05:49.248 line:95%,end
<i>I would never leave Chloe</i>
<i>in Abby's care, but whatever.</i>

00:05:49.315 --> 00:05:51.317 line:95%,end
<i>If Melissa wants Maddie to keep dancing,</i>

00:05:51.384 --> 00:05:52.652 line:95%,end
She's got to keep the boyfriend happy,

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:54.620 line:95%,end
because he's the one
paying the dance bills.

00:05:54.687 --> 00:05:58.391 line:95%,end
Maybe she has to take care
of that relationship

00:05:58.458 --> 00:06:00.093 line:95%,end
to ensure that this continues.

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:02.295 line:95%,end
My boyfriend knows how much
I spend on dance

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:04.197 line:95%,end
because he signs the checks.

00:06:06.632 --> 00:06:08.568 line:95%,end
I guess a girl's got to do
what a girl's got to do.

00:06:08.634 --> 00:06:10.503 line:95%,end
How about you?
How are you feeling,

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.105 line:95%,end
with Brooke and Page being at the bottom?

00:06:12.171 --> 00:06:13.873 line:95%,end
I'm not surprised that
they're at the bottom,

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.908 line:95%,end
just because of my argument with her.

00:06:15.975 --> 00:06:17.777 line:95%,end
I think she thought I was like kidding

00:06:17.844 --> 00:06:20.880 line:95%,end
when I said that, like,
if my kids aren't doing a solo

00:06:20.947 --> 00:06:22.348 line:95%,end
and she won't teach it to them,

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:25.118 line:95%,end
that I wasn't going to get somebody else
to teach them a dance.

00:06:25.184 --> 00:06:27.520 line:95%,end
I paid all this money to come here
and she wants me to do a group dance.

00:06:27.587 --> 00:06:28.788 line:95%,end
I don't think so.

00:06:28.855 --> 00:06:29.789 line:95%,end
How are you going to do this?

00:06:29.856 --> 00:06:32.125 line:95%,end
Like what are you going open up
the yellow pages

00:06:32.191 --> 00:06:33.593 line:95%,end
and look for like choreographers?

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:34.994 line:95%,end
I actually looked into some choreographers

00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:37.397 line:95%,end
and I found two that have
really good credentials.

00:06:37.463 --> 00:06:42.101 line:95%,end
A person can only take so much
and I think Kelly hit her breaking point.

00:06:42.168 --> 00:06:43.770 line:95%,end
<i>And you know what, good for Kelly.</i>

She's got more courage than I do,

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:47.273 line:95%,end
because I don't know if I would
have the nerve to do that.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.775 line:95%,end
So hopefully it'll work out.

00:06:48.841 --> 00:06:50.576 line:95%,end

ABBY: Right, left, whack, down, just rock.

00:06:58.084 --> 00:06:59.952 line:95%,end
All right, come on girls, gather around.

00:07:00.586 --> 00:07:03.856 line:95%,end
In order to get the kids revved up
about the number and excited,

00:07:03.923 --> 00:07:07.427 line:95%,end
and in order for them to feel
what I wanted them to feel,

00:07:07.493 --> 00:07:08.861 line:95%,end
we brought a special guest in.

00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:11.297 line:95%,end
Girls, I have a big surprise for you.

00:07:11.364 --> 00:07:13.266 line:95%,end
I have a visitor coming to see us

00:07:13.966 --> 00:07:18.971 line:95%,end
and she knows everything
about working that stage.

00:07:19.405 --> 00:07:22.241 line:95%,end
Let's all welcome, Laquifa.

00:07:22.842 --> 00:07:24.043 line:95%,end
(screaming)

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.645 line:95%,end

00:07:29.382 --> 00:07:31.584 line:5%,start
<i>âª Laquifa, what?</i>
<i>Laquifa âª</i>

00:07:31.651 --> 00:07:34.187 line:5%,start
And she was like, "Laquifa, what?

00:07:34.253 --> 00:07:35.922 line:95%,end
<i>Laquifa, what?"</i>

00:07:35.988 --> 00:07:36.923 line:95%,end
(chuckles)

00:07:36.989 --> 00:07:38.057 line:95%,end
SINGER: <i>âª I said what? I said what? âª</i>

00:07:38.124 --> 00:07:39.258 line:95%,end
<i>âª I said, I said, I said what? âª</i>

00:07:39.325 --> 00:07:40.460 line:95%,end
HOLLY: <i>I was speechless.</i>

00:07:40.526 --> 00:07:41.594 line:95%,end
<i>It was quite a moment.</i>

00:07:41.661 --> 00:07:43.596 line:5%,start
And it was quite an entrance.

00:07:43.663 --> 00:07:46.766 line:95%,end
SINGER: <i>âª What, what, what, what,</i>
<i>what, what, what, what, what âª</i>

ABBY: <i>I really wanted Holly and Nia</i>

00:07:57.743 --> 00:07:59.412 line:95%,end
<i>to see Shangela perform.</i>

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:02.114 line:95%,end
<i>Because I want that kid</i>

00:08:02.582 --> 00:08:06.319 line:95%,end
SINGER: <i>âª They call me Laquifa,</i>
<i>the postmodern pim-what? âª</i>

00:08:06.385 --> 00:08:08.888 line:95%,end
She can get cast in things
that the other kids can't.

00:08:08.955 --> 00:08:10.623 line:95%,end
I wouldn't even send them
in for those roles.

00:08:11.224 --> 00:08:13.159 line:95%,end
But Nia is a Black diva.

00:08:13.226 --> 00:08:14.861 line:95%,end
<i>And I wanted her to see Shangela,</i>

00:08:14.927 --> 00:08:16.028 line:95%,end
<i>who is the Black diva.</i>

00:08:16.095 --> 00:08:18.364 line:95%,end
Well hi, everyone.

00:08:18.731 --> 00:08:20.433 line:95%,end
My name is Shangela.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.436 line:95%,end
Today Miss Abby invited me
in here to tell you guys

00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:26.939 line:95%,end
a little bit about performance art,
about being sickening,

00:08:27.006 --> 00:08:29.442 line:95%,end
and about really working it
when you're out there, right?

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:32.778 line:95%,end
CHRISTI:
<i>Our kids are fascinated with Laquifa.</i>

00:08:32.845 --> 00:08:34.947 line:95%,end
It could be Santa Claus
that walked in that door

00:08:35.014 --> 00:08:36.115 line:95%,end
and I don't think she would've got--

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:38.351 line:95%,end
or he would have gotten
a better reaction than Laquifa.

00:08:38.417 --> 00:08:39.986 line:95%,end
Maybe I can teach you guys the death drop.

00:08:40.052 --> 00:08:41.854 line:95%,end
-(gasps) Uh, yeah!
-Listen.

00:08:41.921 --> 00:08:43.623 line:95%,end
The death drop really is safe.

00:08:43.689 --> 00:08:45.224 line:95%,end
You're not falling on your back.

00:08:45.291 --> 00:08:46.759 line:95%,end
But okay, so here we go.

00:08:46.826 --> 00:08:48.961 line:95%,end
My pumps... (vocalizing)

00:08:49.028 --> 00:08:50.029 line:95%,end
My pumps.

00:08:50.696 --> 00:08:51.731 line:95%,end
Just like that.

00:08:51.797 --> 00:08:53.499 line:95%,end
And that's the move, okay?

00:08:53.566 --> 00:08:55.334 line:95%,end
HOLLY:
<i>At least Shangela's not wearing an afro.</i>

00:08:55.801 --> 00:08:59.171 line:95%,end
And I am happy that Nia's finally
getting some special attention from Abby.

00:08:59.238 --> 00:09:00.773 line:95%,end
<i>She really deserves it.</i>

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.977 line:95%,end
So Nia, on the ending we're going
to put that trick in there, okay?

00:09:05.044 --> 00:09:09.382 line:95%,end
And let me tell you something,
the crowd is going to go wild.

00:09:09.448 --> 00:09:11.250 line:95%,end
So we're going to come on, and go--

00:09:11.317 --> 00:09:16.822 line:95%,end
do your hip, hip, hip, hip,
and then wipe, whew.

00:09:17.123 --> 00:09:18.958 line:95%,end
And then death drop, pow.

00:09:20.426 --> 00:09:25.965 line:95%,end
Yes, now instead of falling
just here first

00:09:26.032 --> 00:09:27.500 line:95%,end
and then laying,

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:30.803 line:95%,end
try just releasing
going straight back, okay?

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.638 line:95%,end
They're going to say, "Oh, my Lord,
what did she do?"

00:09:32.705 --> 00:09:33.706 line:95%,end
You feel good?

00:09:33.773 --> 00:09:35.174 line:95%,end
You're ready, I know you're ready.

00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:36.475 line:95%,end
HOLLY: <i>I'm like, oh, my gosh.</i>

00:09:36.542 --> 00:09:39.078 line:95%,end
<i>To be honest with you,</i>
<i>my stomach is in knots.</i>

00:09:39.145 --> 00:09:40.613 line:95%,end
<i>I have a lump in my throat.</i>

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.181 line:95%,end
<i>I'm not sure Nia can pull that off.</i>

00:09:43.316 --> 00:09:45.284 line:95%,end
-(cars passing)
-(quirky music playing)

00:09:45.351 --> 00:09:47.053 line:95%,end
(bird crowing)

00:09:47.119 --> 00:09:48.487 line:95%,end
(cow mooing)

00:09:48.554 --> 00:09:51.390 line:95%,end
CATHY: <i>Justice, why don't you</i>
<i>and Vivi just hold hands?</i>

00:09:51.457 --> 00:09:53.659 line:95%,end
All right, okay smile, faces.

00:09:54.493 --> 00:09:57.196 line:95%,end
<i>While Abby and her precious little dancers</i>
<i>are out in Hollywood,</i>

00:09:57.263 --> 00:10:00.366 line:95%,end
<i>I'm at Candy Apples command center</i>
<i>plotting my revenge.</i>

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:04.737 line:95%,end
Contestants number 238 in a duet,

00:10:04.804 --> 00:10:05.838 line:95%,end
Justice and Vivi.

00:10:05.905 --> 00:10:09.542 line:95%,end
<i>After evaluating our time</i>
<i>with the Abby Lee dancers,</i>

00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:13.512 line:5%,start
and not feeling like Abby was utilizing
Vivi the way she should have...

00:10:13.579 --> 00:10:15.615 line:95%,end
Strum your guitar like your...

00:10:16.048 --> 00:10:17.283 line:95%,end
Yeah, Slim Pickens.

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:20.453 line:95%,end
Go, go, go, go, go, go, head, head, head,
head, head, head, head, head, head.

00:10:20.519 --> 00:10:23.923 line:95%,end
I thought that maybe it was time
that Abby see a little bit

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:26.225 line:95%,end
about what Candy Apples
Dance Center was made of.

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:29.795 line:95%,end
Okay, Vivi get that leg up,
one, two, three, four.

00:10:29.862 --> 00:10:33.032 line:95%,end
<i>So we found out where</i>
<i>the Abby Lee Dance Company</i>

00:10:33.099 --> 00:10:36.602 line:95%,end
was going to be heading
and I went back into my dance studio

00:10:36.669 --> 00:10:39.605 line:95%,end
and started to work on some team dances.

00:10:39.672 --> 00:10:41.607 line:95%,end
So I just wanted to talk to you
a little bit about the girl

00:10:41.674 --> 00:10:42.842 line:95%,end
that we're going up against.

00:10:42.908 --> 00:10:45.945 line:95%,end
Her name is Chloe and Abby
holds a lot of stock in her.

00:10:46.012 --> 00:10:47.813 line:95%,end
So here's the catch.

00:10:48.547 --> 00:10:52.351 line:95%,end
I happen to have, in my hand,
your solo music,

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:54.020 line:95%,end
which is gorgeous.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:56.088 line:95%,end
But I also happen to know

00:10:56.155 --> 00:10:59.725 line:95%,end
that it's the same solo music
that Chloe is using.

00:10:59.792 --> 00:11:01.794 line:95%,end
It's no secret that you can go online

00:11:01.861 --> 00:11:06.565 line:95%,end
and find out what the songs are
that the contestants are dancing to.

00:11:06.799 --> 00:11:10.970 line:95%,end
So I chose Chloe's song for Taylor,
just to psych them out.

00:11:11.504 --> 00:11:12.905 line:95%,end
<i>When I show up in Hollywood,</i>

00:11:12.972 --> 00:11:15.541 line:95%,end

Faces!

00:11:23.115 --> 00:11:25.751 line:95%,end
GIANNA: Nia, I already told you
about that degage.

00:11:25.818 --> 00:11:27.820 line:95%,end
(phone ringing)

00:11:33.159 --> 00:11:35.494 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>Right in the middle</i>

<i>I get a phone call from my mom.</i>

00:11:38.164 --> 00:11:39.965 line:95%,end
Hey Gia, I need you do something out here.

00:11:40.032 --> 00:11:40.866 line:95%,end
Okay.

00:11:40.933 --> 00:11:42.668 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>She has been admitted</i>
<i>into the hospital.</i>

00:11:42.735 --> 00:11:43.969 line:95%,end
<i>I don't know what's wrong yet.</i>

00:11:44.036 --> 00:11:44.904 line:95%,end
(somber music playing)

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:46.539 line:95%,end
I need somebody to get online
or your phone.

00:11:46.605 --> 00:11:47.807 line:95%,end
And tell me what time it is.

00:11:47.873 --> 00:11:49.709 line:95%,end
Because I am flying out to Orlando.

00:11:49.775 --> 00:11:51.877 line:95%,end
Try and find me a flight.

00:11:52.278 --> 00:11:53.312 line:95%,end
GIANNA: All right.

00:11:54.046 --> 00:11:56.282 line:95%,end
I can't tell her what time I'm coming.


00:11:59.919 --> 00:12:02.922 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:12:05.157 --> 00:12:07.660 line:5%,start
-Hi.
-Hi, how are you guys?

KELLY: I want my kids
to feel like they're special.

00:12:09.895 --> 00:12:12.231 line:5%,start
It seems like every week
that Maddie and Chloe

00:12:12.298 --> 00:12:16.001 line:95%,end
are getting the best choreography,
and my kids get whatever's left over.

00:12:16.068 --> 00:12:16.902 line:95%,end
<i>And I'm tired of it.</i>

00:12:16.969 --> 00:12:18.137 line:95%,end
-I'm Kelly.
-Mike, it's so nice to meet you, Kelly.

00:12:18.204 --> 00:12:19.105 line:95%,end
This is this my daughter, Paige.

00:12:19.171 --> 00:12:20.239 line:95%,end
MIKE: Hi, Paige.

00:12:20.306 --> 00:12:23.042 line:95%,end
So this week in Los Angeles,
I took it in my own hands

00:12:23.109 --> 00:12:26.245 line:95%,end
and I'm hiring Paige
her own choreographer.

00:12:26.312 --> 00:12:28.280 line:95%,end
I think Abby just kind of pushes her aside

00:12:28.347 --> 00:12:31.183 line:95%,end
and I wanted to try to get her
some better choreography

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:32.451 line:95%,end
that will work for her.

00:12:32.518 --> 00:12:33.352 line:95%,end
Totally.

00:12:33.419 --> 00:12:34.987 line:95%,end
We're really short on time.

00:12:35.054 --> 00:12:37.223 line:95%,end
I think she's a little nervous about that.

00:12:37.289 --> 00:12:39.125 line:95%,end
MIKE: Well, we'll work
at whatever pace you need.

00:12:39.191 --> 00:12:43.295 line:95%,end
And I've danced with Lady Gaga,
Kesha, Adam Lambert,

00:12:43.362 --> 00:12:44.396 line:95%,end
so you're in good hands.

00:12:45.931 --> 00:12:48.134 line:95%,end
Don't (indistinct) sickled back foot.

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.101 line:95%,end
<i>I'm not stupid.</i>

00:12:49.168 --> 00:12:50.703 line:5%,start
I know what's going on behind my back.

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:53.072 line:5%,start
There's another choreographer
right in the other room,

00:12:53.139 --> 00:12:54.406 line:5%,start
working with Paige.

00:12:54.473 --> 00:12:57.643 line:95%,end
<i>In the 30-plus years that Kelly</i>

00:12:57.710 --> 00:13:00.913 line:95%,end
<i>I've never completely trusted her loyalty.</i>

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:03.449 line:95%,end
It kind of reminds me of Cathy's loyalty.

00:13:03.816 --> 00:13:08.120 line:5%,start
CATHY: We've got to show Mackenzie
and Nia that you were so much

00:13:08.187 --> 00:13:11.290 line:5%,start
more capable of what Abby gave you.

00:13:11.357 --> 00:13:15.928 line:5%,start
Vivi had a duet that she didn't get
to show what she was capable of.

00:13:16.295 --> 00:13:18.831 line:95%,end
SINGER: <i>âª Summer seems to go so fast âª</i>

CATHY: <i>Now dancing with Justice,</i>

00:13:23.769 --> 00:13:26.305 line:95%,end
they're doing so much more
than her and Mackenzie did

00:13:26.372 --> 00:13:28.073 line:95%,end
under Abby's watchful eye.

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:31.243 line:95%,end
We've got to prove to her
that she didn't use us

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:32.378 line:95%,end
the way we should have been used.

00:13:32.444 --> 00:13:36.382 line:95%,end
So when we get out to California
and we go to the competition

00:13:36.448 --> 00:13:38.117 line:95%,end
where the Abby Lee Dance Company is,

00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:40.519 line:95%,end
we are going to have a showdown.

00:13:40.586 --> 00:13:41.954 line:95%,end
(spinning sound effect)

00:13:42.321 --> 00:13:46.492 line:5%,start
-(upbeat music playing)
-You hit one, two, three, four, five.

00:13:46.559 --> 00:13:48.227 line:5%,start
The arm will swing on five.

00:13:48.294 --> 00:13:50.229 line:5%,start
PAIGE: I'm kind of nervous
for the new choreography

00:13:50.296 --> 00:13:53.165 line:5%,start
because Mike doesn't know me
like Abby does.

00:13:53.232 --> 00:13:56.435 line:95%,end
And I'm scared Abby's going
to be really mad at me.

00:13:56.502 --> 00:13:59.104 line:95%,end
-(somber music playing)
-Five, six, seven.

00:14:00.306 --> 00:14:01.340 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>Mike is very busy.</i>

00:14:01.407 --> 00:14:03.509 line:95%,end
<i>He told me he only has</i>
<i>a short amount of time</i>

00:14:03.576 --> 00:14:04.510 line:95%,end
<i>to teach her this number.</i>

00:14:04.577 --> 00:14:06.879 line:5%,start
We have today to learn the dance.

00:14:06.946 --> 00:14:10.115 line:5%,start
-(upbeat music playing)
-Straight across, boom, boom, boom.

00:14:11.283 --> 00:14:14.753 line:5%,start
CATHY: One and two, three, and four...

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:18.357 line:95%,end
<i>I think that with Taylor going up</i>
<i>against Chloe and having the same song,</i>

00:14:18.424 --> 00:14:20.459 line:95%,end
We've got a shoo-in for a win.

00:14:20.526 --> 00:14:23.729 line:95%,end
Five, six, seven, eight.

00:14:23.796 --> 00:14:25.931 line:95%,end
Turn it one, two.

00:14:26.265 --> 00:14:28.000 line:5%,start
ABBY: Faster. Turn.

00:14:28.067 --> 00:14:30.736 line:5%,start
CHLOE: I was assigned a solo
called "Dream on a Star."

00:14:30.803 --> 00:14:33.305 line:5%,start
And I want to have my big moment in LA

00:14:33.372 --> 00:14:34.740 line:95%,end
and I want to win pretty badly.

00:14:34.807 --> 00:14:37.877 line:95%,end
But then, I also have to remember
I'm also having fun.

00:14:39.578 --> 00:14:40.613 line:95%,end
Go right after the show.

00:14:40.679 --> 00:14:41.680 line:95%,end
-Because your mom?
-Yeah.

00:14:41.747 --> 00:14:42.915 line:95%,end
Is she okay?
Is she doing okay?

00:14:42.982 --> 00:14:45.150 line:95%,end
ABBY: No, she's in the hospital,
she has a blockage.

00:14:46.352 --> 00:14:48.254 line:95%,end
HOLLY: <i>Abby's mom is in the hospital.</i>

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.188 line:95%,end
That's tough.

00:14:49.255 --> 00:14:51.557 line:95%,end
It's hard to see your mother
in the hospital not being able to walk.


00:14:51.624 --> 00:14:52.625 line:95%,end
That's hard.

00:14:53.292 --> 00:14:55.728 line:95%,end
They haven't given her anything to eat,
she hasn't eaten in four days.

00:14:55.794 --> 00:14:57.930 line:95%,end
I really wish I could
be there with my mom,

00:14:57.997 --> 00:14:59.298 line:95%,end
but I have to be here.

00:14:59.365 --> 00:15:00.432 line:95%,end
I have a job to do.

00:15:00.499 --> 00:15:04.236 line:95%,end
These mothers have no idea
what sacrifices I make for them

00:15:04.303 --> 00:15:05.471 line:95%,end
and their children.

00:15:05.537 --> 00:15:09.241 line:95%,end
All of your other solos
are pretty and elegant.

00:15:09.308 --> 00:15:11.844 line:95%,end
This is not the case, yes?

00:15:12.211 --> 00:15:15.848 line:95%,end
Maddie is doing a contemporary
piece called "Disappear."

00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:18.183 line:95%,end
And it's about a child who's being abused

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:20.753 line:95%,end
<i>and eventually commits suicide.</i>

00:15:20.819 --> 00:15:22.421 line:95%,end
You're being abused.

00:15:22.488 --> 00:15:24.056 line:95%,end
You want to disappear.

00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:26.792 line:95%,end
You don't want anyone else to know.

00:15:27.626 --> 00:15:31.864 line:95%,end
And you're finished and nobody knows
you exist and nobody cares.

00:15:31.931 --> 00:15:33.732 line:95%,end
<i>It's a very mature piece.</i>

00:15:34.433 --> 00:15:37.036 line:95%,end
<i>Some would think it's too mature</i>
<i>for an eight-year-old.</i>

00:15:37.102 --> 00:15:39.238 line:95%,end
But I think she's ready to handle this.

00:15:39.305 --> 00:15:41.006 line:95%,end
When they see you come out on stage

00:15:41.073 --> 00:15:43.208 line:95%,end
they should say, "Oh, my God,
that poor little girl."

00:15:43.275 --> 00:15:46.879 line:5%,start
MADDIE: I'm doing is a solo this week
and it's a very serious number.

00:15:46.946 --> 00:15:49.214 line:95%,end
<i>Abby told me that my acting skills</i>

00:15:49.281 --> 00:15:51.750 line:95%,end
have to be even more than my dance skills.

00:15:52.618 --> 00:15:54.386 line:5%,start
KELLY: Paige, you really have to work it.

00:15:54.453 --> 00:15:55.554 line:95%,end
That's the whole thing.

00:15:55.621 --> 00:15:58.457 line:95%,end
Use your attitude, be sexy.

00:15:58.524 --> 00:16:02.494 line:95%,end
Show Miss Abby that look,
I learned this cool dance without you.

00:16:02.561 --> 00:16:04.029 line:95%,end
That's what you need to show her.

00:16:04.096 --> 00:16:05.631 line:95%,end
<i>The dance Mike was choreographing</i>

00:16:05.698 --> 00:16:08.801 line:95%,end
<i>had a lot of body movement in it.</i>

00:16:08.867 --> 00:16:11.937 line:95%,end
It wasn't a lot of technique
and Paige just seemed a little tense.

00:16:12.004 --> 00:16:15.374 line:95%,end
<i>So I kept trying to get her</i>
<i>to just loosen up and relax.</i>

00:16:15.441 --> 00:16:18.577 line:95%,end
Your body should move with the music.

00:16:18.644 --> 00:16:20.579 line:95%,end
I think you're just scared of something.

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.115 line:95%,end
I don't know if you're scared of yourself.
Or you're scared of Abby,

00:16:23.182 --> 00:16:24.350 line:95%,end
you're scared of this choreography

00:16:24.416 --> 00:16:27.686 line:95%,end
because it's new and like
not familiar to you.

00:16:27.753 --> 00:16:28.687 line:95%,end
He's right.

00:16:28.754 --> 00:16:29.922 line:95%,end
(tense music playing)

00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:31.523 line:95%,end
You can smell it from a mile away.

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:33.525 line:95%,end
I'm not judging you.
Your mom's not judging you.

00:16:33.592 --> 00:16:36.762 line:95%,end
We just want you to do
the best that you can, okay?

00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:39.598 line:95%,end
(tense music playing)

00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:48.640 line:95%,end
(sighs)

00:16:48.707 --> 00:16:51.744 line:5%,start
Paige was so upset, she walked out
and locked herself in the bathroom.

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:53.212 line:95%,end
<i>I've never seen Paige like this.</i>

00:16:53.278 --> 00:16:54.380 line:95%,end
(Paige crying)

00:16:54.446 --> 00:16:55.647 line:95%,end
I don't want to do it.

00:16:55.714 --> 00:16:56.615 line:95%,end
KELLY: Don't be upset.

00:16:56.682 --> 00:16:58.784 line:95%,end
Paige, I'm not going to let you do it,
if you're not ready.

00:16:58.851 --> 00:16:59.918 line:95%,end
I promise.

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:02.988 line:95%,end
Paige is upset for a few reasons.

00:17:03.055 --> 00:17:05.758 line:95%,end
She's upset that Abby's going
to be disappointed in her

00:17:05.824 --> 00:17:08.694 line:95%,end
or mad at her for hiring
another choreographer.

00:17:08.761 --> 00:17:13.365 line:95%,end
And she's also upset that we have today
to learn the dance.

00:17:15.367 --> 00:17:16.902 line:5%,start
ABBY: <i>Who wants a mediocre kid?</i>

00:17:16.969 --> 00:17:18.804 line:95%,end
Every time one of my students
step on stage,

00:17:18.871 --> 00:17:20.039 line:95%,end
it's my name out there.

00:17:20.105 --> 00:17:21.006 line:95%,end
They are representing me.

00:17:21.073 --> 00:17:23.442 line:95%,end
<i>But in this particular instance,</i>
<i>you know what?</i>

00:17:23.509 --> 00:17:24.843 line:95%,end
<i>Let Kelly go ahead.</i>

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:26.345 line:95%,end
Let her kids represent her.

00:17:26.412 --> 00:17:27.613 line:95%,end
<i>Let's see where they get.</i>

00:17:27.679 --> 00:17:29.114 line:95%,end
(Paige crying)

00:17:29.181 --> 00:17:31.150 line:95%,end
KELLY: You need to just chill out.

00:17:31.216 --> 00:17:32.351 line:95%,end
Have fun with it.

00:17:32.418 --> 00:17:35.421 line:95%,end
As soon as Paige stands on stage
and forgets the choreography again,

00:17:35.487 --> 00:17:37.356 line:95%,end
Kelly's going to regret her decision.

00:17:37.423 --> 00:17:41.427 line:95%,end
If you're not ready to do it tomorrow,
we just won't dance tomorrow, okay?


00:17:43.128 --> 00:17:45.564 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:17:47.299 --> 00:17:50.035 line:5%,start
ABBY: ...four, five, six, seven, eight.

00:17:50.102 --> 00:17:52.571 line:5%,start
Here we are rehearsing for <i>iHollywood.</i>

00:17:52.638 --> 00:17:55.941 line:5%,start
My girls are going to be performing
for big time casting agents.

00:17:56.008 --> 00:17:57.543 line:95%,end
I don't have time for Kelly's drama.

00:17:57.609 --> 00:18:01.146 line:95%,end
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

00:18:01.213 --> 00:18:03.348 line:95%,end
(sighing)
God almighty.

00:18:03.415 --> 00:18:06.085 line:95%,end
Okay, you don't need be in here.
You don't need to be in here.

00:18:06.151 --> 00:18:07.319 line:95%,end
You don't need to be in here.

00:18:07.386 --> 00:18:09.922 line:95%,end
KELLY: Abby, I want my kids
to still be in the groups.

00:18:09.988 --> 00:18:12.524 line:95%,end
You can't do that. And you said,
then I'll go as an independent.

00:18:13.292 --> 00:18:17.629 line:95%,end
I'm doing the group dance
and I'm doing a solo as an independent.

00:18:17.696 --> 00:18:18.697 line:95%,end
It doesn't work that way.

00:18:19.998 --> 00:18:22.801 line:95%,end
You can't register as part of a group
and as an independent.

00:18:22.868 --> 00:18:25.137 line:95%,end
If you go as an independent,
then you're out.

00:18:25.204 --> 00:18:26.772 line:95%,end
I want to make it perfectly clear,

00:18:27.272 --> 00:18:30.576 line:95%,end
when I enter a competition,
those are my numbers.

00:18:30.642 --> 00:18:31.910 line:95%,end
Those are my routines.

00:18:31.977 --> 00:18:34.480 line:95%,end
<i>I am not going to let Paige turn around</i>

00:18:34.546 --> 00:18:36.181 line:95%,end
<i>and do some other choreographer's routine</i>

00:18:36.248 --> 00:18:38.784 line:95%,end
that I've never even seen before,
under my name.

00:18:38.851 --> 00:18:40.219 line:95%,end
Not going to happen.

00:18:40.285 --> 00:18:41.687 line:95%,end
I'm not going to put somebody on my stage

00:18:41.753 --> 00:18:43.856 line:95%,end
that I haven't even seen their dance,
under my name.

00:18:43.922 --> 00:18:45.424 line:95%,end
KELLY:
They love to be in the group numbers.

00:18:45.491 --> 00:18:46.959 line:95%,end
They want to be with their friends.

00:18:47.025 --> 00:18:48.393 line:95%,end
They want to be with you.

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:51.130 line:95%,end
But if you do that,
then you're not a part of the group.

00:18:51.196 --> 00:18:53.098 line:95%,end
If you register your kids
as an independent,

00:18:53.165 --> 00:18:54.566 line:95%,end
they can't be part of the group.

00:18:54.633 --> 00:18:59.805 line:95%,end
Abby, alls I want is for my kids
to get good choreography.

00:19:02.674 --> 00:19:06.445 line:95%,end
For you to be unhappy
with your choreography is a joke.

00:19:06.512 --> 00:19:09.715 line:95%,end
I have done brilliant work for her,
adorable work.

00:19:09.781 --> 00:19:11.283 line:95%,end
People call me after the competitions,

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:12.384 line:95%,end
"I want that music.

00:19:12.451 --> 00:19:13.819 line:95%,end
<i>Oh, where did you get that costume?"</i>

00:19:13.886 --> 00:19:16.922 line:95%,end
<i>And now, suddenly she's going</i>

00:19:18.223 --> 00:19:19.358 line:95%,end
I mean, just that one little thing

00:19:19.424 --> 00:19:20.893 line:95%,end
to make them feel special.

00:19:20.959 --> 00:19:23.629 line:95%,end
But I wasn't put on this Earth
to make her feel special.

00:19:23.695 --> 00:19:26.165 line:95%,end
I was put on this Earth to make her dance.

00:19:26.231 --> 00:19:27.599 line:95%,end
<i>Kelly just doesn't get it.</i>

00:19:27.666 --> 00:19:30.002 line:95%,end
<i>Her kids do not pick up quickly.</i>

00:19:30.068 --> 00:19:33.138 line:95%,end
She thinks that if she had somebody
to work with her kids

00:19:33.205 --> 00:19:35.474 line:95%,end
every single week for a half an hour,

00:19:35.541 --> 00:19:38.510 line:95%,end
that their solos would be
winning like Maddie's.

00:19:38.577 --> 00:19:40.345 line:95%,end
And I taught her a great routine.

00:19:40.412 --> 00:19:41.580 line:95%,end
You didn't even look at it.

00:19:46.385 --> 00:19:49.054 line:5%,start
(dramatic music playing)

00:19:50.189 --> 00:19:51.557 line:95%,end
Right here, babe.

<i>I'm taking Maddie to lunch</i>

00:19:55.093 --> 00:19:57.629 line:95%,end
and all the moms are doing stuff
with their children.

00:19:57.696 --> 00:19:59.998 line:95%,end
<i>So I thought we would go to lunch together</i>

00:20:00.065 --> 00:20:01.600 line:95%,end
<i>and talk about her career,</i>

00:20:01.667 --> 00:20:03.435 line:95%,end
talk about what she wants in the future.

00:20:03.502 --> 00:20:05.037 line:95%,end
What else do you want to do?

00:20:05.103 --> 00:20:06.405 line:95%,end
You just keep winning everything.

00:20:06.471 --> 00:20:07.539 line:95%,end
I want to be on Broadway.

ABBY: You want to be on Broadway?

00:20:09.241 --> 00:20:10.375 line:95%,end
What about, like, here?

00:20:10.442 --> 00:20:11.310 line:95%,end
We're in LA.

00:20:11.376 --> 00:20:13.745 line:95%,end
Like, you don't think
you could be in a movie?

<i>I really see Maddie having a future.</i>

00:20:15.847 --> 00:20:17.216 line:95%,end
<i>She could have her own television show.</i>

00:20:17.282 --> 00:20:18.650 line:5%,start
You know, she has it all.

00:20:18.717 --> 00:20:21.186 line:5%,start
She has what it takes and she wants it.

You know, they put my mom
in the hospital in Florida.

00:20:23.956 --> 00:20:25.257 line:95%,end
-Did you hear that?
-Mm-hmm.

00:20:25.324 --> 00:20:27.893 line:95%,end
So I'm kind of missing her
like you're missing your mom.

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:31.296 line:95%,end
My mom, the one and only
Maryen Lorrain is home.

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:33.065 line:95%,end
-(laughter)
-Hey.

00:20:33.131 --> 00:20:34.299 line:95%,end
ABBY: I'm an only child.

00:20:34.366 --> 00:20:37.302 line:95%,end
So my mom and I, the two of us,
we're a team.

00:20:37.369 --> 00:20:40.305 line:95%,end
And we only have each other in this world.

00:20:40.372 --> 00:20:41.206 line:95%,end
That's it.

00:20:41.273 --> 00:20:43.809 line:95%,end
So it's very difficult for me
to be away from her.

00:20:44.209 --> 00:20:46.044 line:95%,end
I have find out how my mom is doing.

00:20:47.045 --> 00:20:49.514 line:95%,end
MADDIE: <i>I'm sad that Abby's mom</i>
<i>is in the hospital.</i>

00:20:49.581 --> 00:20:51.016 line:5%,start
It makes me miss my mom.

00:20:51.083 --> 00:20:52.150 line:95%,end
I don't know if she'll pick up.

00:20:52.217 --> 00:20:54.253 line:95%,end
They might have her
doing tests or something.

00:20:55.187 --> 00:20:56.221 line:95%,end
MARYEN (on phone): <i>Hello?</i>

00:20:56.288 --> 00:20:57.556 line:95%,end
Hey, Mom. How you doing?

00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:59.958 line:95%,end
MARYEN: <i>Uh, so, so.</i>

00:21:00.626 --> 00:21:01.693 line:95%,end
ABBY: So so?

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:04.363 line:95%,end
MARYEN: <i>I'm still in a little pain.</i>

00:21:04.429 --> 00:21:06.765 line:95%,end
-Pain?
-MARYEN: <i>My stomach is throbbing.</i>

00:21:06.832 --> 00:21:07.899 line:95%,end
ABBY: It's still killing you?

00:21:08.467 --> 00:21:10.102 line:95%,end
MARYEN:
<i>I've had a little water and that's it.</i>

00:21:10.168 --> 00:21:12.137 line:95%,end
ABBY: They still haven't
given you anything to eat?


00:21:12.704 --> 00:21:13.705 line:95%,end
MARYEN: <i>No.</i>

00:21:14.406 --> 00:21:16.041 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>It's been a really rough day for me.</i>

00:21:16.108 --> 00:21:18.710 line:95%,end
<i>I think sometimes the moms</i>
<i>forget that I have a life, too,</i>

00:21:18.777 --> 00:21:20.112 line:95%,end
<i>and I don't need their crap.</i>

00:21:20.712 --> 00:21:23.282 line:95%,end
<i>I don't want to hear Kelly</i>
<i>complaining and whining</i>

00:21:23.348 --> 00:21:24.916 line:95%,end
<i>that she doesn't get special treatment.</i>

00:21:24.983 --> 00:21:26.418 line:95%,end
Frankly, I've had it.

00:21:26.485 --> 00:21:29.988 line:5%,start
(upbeat music playing)

00:21:32.224 --> 00:21:33.925 line:95%,end
(indistinct chatter)

00:21:33.992 --> 00:21:35.427 line:95%,end
And remember what I always tell you.

00:21:35.494 --> 00:21:38.297 line:95%,end
When you walk off that stage,
the girl after you better think

00:21:38.363 --> 00:21:40.532 line:95%,end
it's the best performance of your life.

00:21:40.599 --> 00:21:43.902 line:95%,end
<i>This is our last competition</i>
<i>before the big final Nationals</i>

00:21:43.969 --> 00:21:45.070 line:95%,end
<i>in Lake Tahoe.</i>

00:21:45.137 --> 00:21:46.738 line:95%,end
<i>So it's important as a group.</i>

00:21:46.805 --> 00:21:47.873 line:95%,end
It's important to the kids.

00:21:47.939 --> 00:21:49.808 line:95%,end
It's important that they be seen.

00:21:49.875 --> 00:21:52.878 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:21:53.745 --> 00:21:56.381 line:95%,end
We came, we saw, we kicked apples.

00:21:56.448 --> 00:21:59.184 line:95%,end
<i>We've come all the way from Ohio to LA,</i>

00:21:59.251 --> 00:22:02.154 line:5%,start
and I've put a lot of eggs
in one basket coming here.

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:05.891 line:95%,end
<i>I want to prove to Abby</i>
<i>that we are the better team.</i>

00:22:06.124 --> 00:22:07.092 line:95%,end
Hmm.

00:22:07.159 --> 00:22:08.393 line:95%,end
I know. Let's go.

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:10.128 line:95%,end
Opera boy and girl.

00:22:10.195 --> 00:22:11.663 line:95%,end
(vocalizing)

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:13.131 line:95%,end
CATHY: Okay, hmm.

00:22:13.198 --> 00:22:16.401 line:95%,end
If Candy Apples and the Abby Lee
Dance Center clashed,

00:22:16.468 --> 00:22:18.670 line:95%,end
it could be like a boxing match.

00:22:21.006 --> 00:22:23.241 line:95%,end
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>Maybe it's something I can do.</i>

00:22:23.308 --> 00:22:24.910 line:95%,end
Maybe it's something I need to do.

00:22:26.678 --> 00:22:28.347 line:95%,end
Surprise!

00:22:30.282 --> 00:22:32.284 line:95%,end
-Hi.
-WOMAN: Oh. Hello.

00:22:33.685 --> 00:22:35.520 line:95%,end
-CATHY: Hi, everybody.
-What are you doing here?

00:22:35.587 --> 00:22:36.755 line:95%,end
I have something for you.

00:22:36.822 --> 00:22:38.557 line:95%,end
ABBY: Are you, like, here in the hotel?

00:22:38.623 --> 00:22:40.292 line:95%,end
-Are you at the convention or the--
-CATHY: I am here in the hotel.

00:22:40.359 --> 00:22:41.526 line:95%,end
I don't like the hotel.

00:22:41.593 --> 00:22:44.129 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>Cathy walks into our dressing room.</i>

00:22:44.196 --> 00:22:46.832 line:95%,end
Out of nowhere, like thin air,
she shows up.

00:22:46.898 --> 00:22:48.400 line:95%,end
And I'm like, "What are you doing here?"

00:22:48.467 --> 00:22:51.303 line:95%,end
I don't think that woman has
ever been out of Ohio before.

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:52.871 line:95%,end
<i>Suddenly, she's in LA?</i>

00:22:52.938 --> 00:22:55.140 line:95%,end
CATHY: I do want to
introduce you to somebody.

00:22:55.207 --> 00:22:56.508 line:95%,end
This is Justice.

00:22:56.575 --> 00:23:00.078 line:95%,end
And I would like you
to be introduced to Taylor.

00:23:00.645 --> 00:23:02.948 line:95%,end
Taylor is a three time title winner.

00:23:03.014 --> 00:23:04.850 line:95%,end
Can you tell them what titles you've won?

00:23:04.916 --> 00:23:07.886 line:95%,end
Junior Miss Dynamite, Junior Miss KAR
and Junior Miss Nexstar.

00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:11.590 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>I guess Cathy</i>
<i>flew Taylor across country</i>

00:23:11.656 --> 00:23:13.024 line:95%,end
<i>to go head-to-head against Chloe.</i>

00:23:13.091 --> 00:23:15.327 line:95%,end
God's sakes, leave my kid alone.

00:23:15.394 --> 00:23:18.263 line:95%,end
CATHY: Vivi and Justice are going
to be doing a duo together.

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:21.533 line:95%,end
And I think, Mackenzie and Nia,

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.702 line:95%,end
you guys are going to be
competing against them.

00:23:24.136 --> 00:23:25.771 line:95%,end
So that should be pretty interesting.

00:23:25.837 --> 00:23:27.606 line:5%,start
HOLLY: She was here to challenge us,

00:23:27.672 --> 00:23:32.644 line:5%,start
and to basically put our noses in, like,
"My kids will do better than you."

00:23:32.711 --> 00:23:34.212 line:95%,end
Surprised to see you here, Cathy.

00:23:34.279 --> 00:23:35.113 line:95%,end
CATHY: Yeah.

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:36.648 line:95%,end
I thought you were with dance
for the season.

00:23:36.715 --> 00:23:38.517 line:95%,end
CATHY: Well, you know,
I'm here because I remember

00:23:38.583 --> 00:23:40.786 line:95%,end
a certain somebody told me to bring it on.

00:23:40.852 --> 00:23:42.421 line:95%,end
So consider it brought.

00:23:42.487 --> 00:23:44.823 line:95%,end
-KELLY: Let's bring your studio...
-CATHY: You know what?

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:46.224 line:95%,end
-Bring it on, babe.
-KELLY: ...to a competition we go to.

00:23:46.291 --> 00:23:47.926 line:95%,end
-Bring it on! Bring it on!
KELLY: Bring It on, Cathy.

00:23:47.993 --> 00:23:49.961 line:95%,end
-ABBY: Cathy, you don't even come to LA.
-CATHY: Well--

00:23:50.028 --> 00:23:51.530 line:95%,end
ABBY: Like, you do all
those competitions in Ohio.

00:23:51.596 --> 00:23:53.231 line:95%,end
CATHY: Gosh. Here, wait,
let me pinch myself.

00:23:53.298 --> 00:23:54.766 line:95%,end
-I'm here.
-Well, it's--

00:23:54.833 --> 00:23:56.868 line:95%,end
CATHY: We've never done it before
so we wanted to try it

00:23:56.935 --> 00:24:00.972 line:95%,end
and, you know, just kind of kick around
a couple new pieces of choreography--

00:24:01.039 --> 00:24:03.975 line:95%,end
fresh choreography, not old, boring,

00:24:04.042 --> 00:24:05.377 line:95%,end
dated choreography.

00:24:05.444 --> 00:24:07.913 line:95%,end
I, on the other hand,
don't have the philosophy

00:24:07.979 --> 00:24:11.016 line:95%,end
of just keep using the same
tired stuff because it works.

00:24:12.551 --> 00:24:14.419 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>Then she started on my choreography.</i>

00:24:15.454 --> 00:24:17.656 line:95%,end
Who does that to another professional?

00:24:17.722 --> 00:24:19.791 line:95%,end
<i>Her daughter didn't know</i>
<i>her right foot from her left.</i>

00:24:20.258 --> 00:24:22.027 line:95%,end
She could do a heel stretch
holding her leg the wrong way.

00:24:22.093 --> 00:24:22.928 line:95%,end
That's it.

00:24:22.994 --> 00:24:25.597 line:95%,end
I have kids working all over the place.

00:24:25.664 --> 00:24:27.666 line:95%,end
-I can walk into any club--
-And so we've heard.

00:24:27.732 --> 00:24:29.134 line:95%,end
-Yes.
-And so we've heard.

00:24:29.201 --> 00:24:30.669 line:95%,end
And kids that are working, too.

00:24:30.735 --> 00:24:31.570 line:95%,end
-Name them.
-Okay.

00:24:31.636 --> 00:24:32.771 line:95%,end
Because I've never heard of one of them.

00:24:32.838 --> 00:24:35.307 line:95%,end
Well, I have Loris,
who is in New York City.

00:24:35.373 --> 00:24:36.241 line:95%,end
-Doing what?
-I have Matt--

00:24:36.308 --> 00:24:37.175 line:95%,end
-What show?
-Well--

00:24:37.242 --> 00:24:38.677 line:95%,end
-Tell me what Broadway show she's in.
-She's not in a Broadway show.

00:24:38.743 --> 00:24:39.744 line:95%,end
Failure!


00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:44.316 line:95%,end
(tense music playing)

00:24:44.382 --> 00:24:45.550 line:95%,end
You told me to bring it on.

00:24:45.617 --> 00:24:46.852 line:95%,end
You told me to bring it on.

00:24:46.918 --> 00:24:48.353 line:95%,end
So consider it brought.
Good luck.

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:50.722 line:95%,end
Yeah, and take it all the way
back to Ohio, too.

00:24:52.591 --> 00:24:54.693 line:95%,end
<i>Great. Now I have two traitors.</i>

00:24:54.759 --> 00:24:56.595 line:95%,end
<i>First it was Kelly and the choreographer,</i>

00:24:56.661 --> 00:24:59.064 line:95%,end
<i>now I have Cathy</i>
<i>and her rotten little apples.</i>

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:02.834 line:5%,start
I need to get it together and focus
on what I came here to do.

00:25:02.901 --> 00:25:04.936 line:5%,start
Make my kids' dreams come true.

00:25:05.003 --> 00:25:06.304 line:95%,end
Bring it on, girlfriend.

00:25:06.371 --> 00:25:09.007 line:95%,end
-Bring it on.
-ABBY: Chloe, we're going against them.

00:25:09.708 --> 00:25:11.510 line:5%,start
MADDIE: Bring it, Candy Apples.

00:25:11.576 --> 00:25:12.811 line:95%,end
Go.

00:25:15.113 --> 00:25:16.681 line:95%,end
CATHY: <i>Vengeance is always fun.</i>

00:25:16.748 --> 00:25:17.749 line:95%,end
<i>Is it vengeance?</i>

00:25:17.816 --> 00:25:20.085 line:5%,start
I would say it's artistic vengeance

00:25:20.151 --> 00:25:23.421 line:5%,start
because I want her to see
what Vivi's capable of.

00:25:23.488 --> 00:25:27.025 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:25:31.229 --> 00:25:35.000 line:95%,end
KELLY: We only learned 30 seconds
of Paige's solo yesterday.

00:25:35.066 --> 00:25:37.636 line:95%,end
HOLLY: That's it? How did that person
work out, the choreographer?

00:25:37.702 --> 00:25:39.137 line:95%,end
We only got 30 seconds done,

00:25:39.204 --> 00:25:41.439 line:95%,end
so I don't know how in the world
we'll compete it.

00:25:41.506 --> 00:25:43.008 line:95%,end
HOLLY: How come you didn't finish it?

00:25:43.542 --> 00:25:44.943 line:95%,end
We ran out of time.

00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:46.077 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Oh.

00:25:46.144 --> 00:25:47.946 line:95%,end
How is that number, Paige?

00:25:50.782 --> 00:25:51.983 line:95%,end
Did you learn the whole thing?

00:25:52.517 --> 00:25:53.985 line:95%,end
<i>Kelly made bad decisions.</i>

00:25:54.452 --> 00:25:56.121 line:95%,end
<i>Bad parenting, once again.</i>

00:25:56.187 --> 00:25:57.589 line:95%,end
She's going to go behind my back,

00:25:57.656 --> 00:25:59.224 line:95%,end
try to bring in other choreographers,

00:25:59.291 --> 00:26:00.659 line:95%,end
and it backfired on her.

00:26:00.725 --> 00:26:02.594 line:95%,end
<i>And now she's a mess</i>
<i>and doesn't know what to do.</i>

00:26:02.661 --> 00:26:04.529 line:95%,end
KELLY: I hired this
choreographer yesterday.

00:26:04.596 --> 00:26:05.430 line:95%,end
ABBY: Right.

00:26:05.497 --> 00:26:09.000 line:95%,end
And they didn't have enough time
to finish their dances.

00:26:10.368 --> 00:26:11.937 line:95%,end
ABBY: You wanted an outside choreographer.

00:26:12.003 --> 00:26:12.904 line:95%,end
I know that, Abby.

00:26:12.971 --> 00:26:14.673 line:95%,end
You either need to pull out of the groups

00:26:14.739 --> 00:26:17.208 line:95%,end
and go as an independent
and do the numbers...

00:26:17.275 --> 00:26:18.310 line:95%,end
-KELLY: Yeah.
-...and prove me wrong.

00:26:18.376 --> 00:26:19.611 line:95%,end
-But if I was doing it--
-And they need--

00:26:19.678 --> 00:26:22.047 line:95%,end
they need you to beat
every other 13-year-old,

00:26:22.113 --> 00:26:23.648 line:95%,end
and she needs to beat Chloe and Maddie.

00:26:23.715 --> 00:26:25.083 line:95%,end
It's just blowing up in her face.

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:26.985 line:95%,end
KELLY: (crying)
I'm not doing it to my kids.

00:26:27.052 --> 00:26:28.053 line:95%,end
I'm not.

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:29.187 line:95%,end
Don't cry!

00:26:29.254 --> 00:26:30.922 line:95%,end
It's all your fault to begin with.

00:26:30.989 --> 00:26:32.657 line:95%,end
-Why can't you just be smart?

MADDIE: <i>I thought I danced the best,</i>

And everybody gets a chance to win,

Third?

<i>Unacceptable.</i>

<i>Obviously, her daughter</i>

00:38:55.566 --> 00:38:59.603 line:95%,end
So she goes back home and comes
and competes against us here?

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:00.705 line:95%,end
You know what, guys?

00:39:01.238 --> 00:39:05.376 line:95%,end
I can go home and fix
what my kids did wrong.

00:39:06.043 --> 00:39:08.212 line:95%,end
You can't fix (bleep).

00:39:08.279 --> 00:39:10.114 line:95%,end
KELLY: Well, you can't get
any better than first, Cathy.

00:39:10.181 --> 00:39:14.385 line:95%,end
ABBY: I cannot believe
that's a grown adult

that teaches children.

00:39:16.387 --> 00:39:17.621 line:95%,end
They think I'm bad?

CATHY: <i>We may not have done as well</i>
<i>in Hollywood as I had hoped for,</i>

00:39:21.692 --> 00:39:24.562 line:95%,end

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:27.531 line:95%,end
I want to say one thing.

00:39:27.598 --> 00:39:29.934 line:95%,end
I was very proud that
you stood on that stage,

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.503 line:95%,end
you took that second, you smiled,
you had fun with your friends.

00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:35.339 line:95%,end
That even proved more of a professional

00:39:35.406 --> 00:39:36.907 line:95%,end
than winning all the time.

00:39:36.974 --> 00:39:39.744 line:95%,end
And, Kelly, out of all the crap
about the choreographers--

00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:43.881 line:95%,end
KELLY: All I want is for you
to make my kids feel like,

00:39:43.948 --> 00:39:47.718 line:95%,end
before they go on stage,
that you care that they do well.

00:39:47.785 --> 00:39:50.388 line:95%,end
-KELLY: I'm not a dance teacher.
-But, see you're enabling the stupidity.

00:39:50.955 --> 00:39:53.958 line:95%,end
You are enabling them
to not be able to go in

00:39:54.024 --> 00:39:54.959 line:95%,end
-and work on their own.
-KELLY: Okay, but--

00:39:55.025 --> 00:39:56.193 line:95%,end
ABBY: It's still a game.

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:58.996 line:95%,end
And that's okay because
you keep telling them it's okay.

00:39:59.063 --> 00:40:00.197 line:95%,end
Then I'll tell you what,

00:40:00.264 --> 00:40:03.434 line:95%,end
I am here and my mother is in a hospital.

00:40:03.501 --> 00:40:04.969 line:95%,end
And I'm here with your kid.

00:40:05.035 --> 00:40:06.937 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: But I think what
you're missing, honestly,

00:40:07.004 --> 00:40:08.205 line:95%,end
because maybe you're not a mother,

00:40:08.806 --> 00:40:12.243 line:95%,end
is that these children crave your approval

00:40:12.309 --> 00:40:13.711 line:95%,end
-just like they do their mothers.
-ABBY: That's right.

00:40:13.778 --> 00:40:15.646 line:95%,end
-CHRISTI: They do.
-And I want them to keep craving it.

00:40:15.713 --> 00:40:17.381 line:95%,end
-That's fine. Let's just leave it at that.
-ABBY: There's other kids

00:40:17.448 --> 00:40:19.083 line:95%,end
that want to make a career out of it.

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:21.352 line:95%,end
-KELLY: Keep throwing--
-ABBY: You want my undivided attention

00:40:21.419 --> 00:40:22.553 line:95%,end
but you don't want to be serious about it.

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:25.389 line:95%,end
KELLY: Okay. Only reason
I brought a choreographer in

00:40:25.456 --> 00:40:28.426 line:95%,end
is because I want my kids
to get the special attention.

00:40:28.492 --> 00:40:29.693 line:95%,end
And you see where that got you.

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:33.664 line:5%,start
KELLY: So let--let me not pay someone
to do it and have Gianna do it

00:40:33.731 --> 00:40:34.732 line:5%,start
the way she does it with Maddie.

00:40:34.799 --> 00:40:35.766 line:5%,start
-That's what I want.
-Maddie and Gianna have

00:40:35.833 --> 00:40:36.934 line:5%,start
-a special relationship.
-KELLY: That's what I want.

00:40:37.001 --> 00:40:38.202 line:5%,start
Well, I want to have somebody here

00:40:38.269 --> 00:40:40.171 line:5%,start
that has a special relationship
with my daughter,

00:40:40.237 --> 00:40:42.406 line:5%,start
to run her numbers the way
she runs them with Maddie.

00:40:42.473 --> 00:40:43.808 line:5%,start
I don't know. What did Kelly
give you for Christmas?

00:40:43.874 --> 00:40:46.243 line:5%,start
I don't need to buy Gianna
something for Christmas.

00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:47.511 line:5%,start
She's a (bleep) teacher!

00:40:47.578 --> 00:40:49.480 line:5%,start
That language is not allowed in my school.

00:40:50.714 --> 00:40:51.782 line:5%,start
I'm sorry, girls.

00:40:51.849 --> 00:40:53.784 line:5%,start
<i>When we get to Lake Tahoe, that's it.</i>

00:40:53.851 --> 00:40:55.286 line:5%,start
<i>It's the end of the road for us.</i>

00:40:55.352 --> 00:40:56.220 line:5%,start
Third?

00:40:56.287 --> 00:40:58.989 line:5%,start
How do we go from third to first
in a week on the road?
