Where Have All the Children Gone.

CATHY: <i>Brooke is now wearing Vivi's top.</i>
<i>I'm not happy.</i>

00:00:16.916 --> 00:00:18.485 line:5%,start
I don't want Brooke wearing the costume.

00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:19.519 line:5%,start
-My daughter is dancing...
-CATHY: I don't approve.

00:00:19.586 --> 00:00:20.553 line:5%,start
-...in three minutes.
-Well, I'm sorry.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:21.988 line:5%,start
KELLY: And you're taking
the costume off of her back.

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:23.990 line:5%,start
-CATHY: I know.
-Go back to your studio.

00:00:24.057 --> 00:00:26.226 line:5%,start
You know what? I'm not. I'm here to stay,

00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:27.727 line:5%,start
so like it.

00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:29.062 line:5%,start
ABBY: <i>Coming up on </i>Dance Moms...

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:30.130 line:5%,start
Two--arms, Nia!

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:31.431 line:5%,start
Three--where are those arms?

00:00:31.498 --> 00:00:33.233 line:5%,start
I want her in an Afro.

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:34.634 line:5%,start
HOLLY: <i>The same type of thing.</i>

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:36.336 line:5%,start
She should just pick
some cotton or something.

00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:37.604 line:5%,start
That's the next thing she'll pull out.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.874 line:5%,start
I just wanted to warn you that
Dawn Check is here to talk to you.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.308 line:5%,start
She should be here to pay her bill.

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:45.145 line:5%,start
You never paid for the rest of your solo.

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:46.613 line:5%,start
You broke the contract.

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:48.048 line:5%,start
I don't owe you anything.

00:00:48.114 --> 00:00:49.082 line:5%,start
I'll see you in court.

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:51.451 line:5%,start
I feel like the eyelashes are drooping.

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:53.219 line:5%,start
Do I need to staple your eyebrows up?

00:00:53.286 --> 00:00:56.956 line:5%,start
I pay, what, almost $100,000 a year
in private school tuition,

00:00:57.023 --> 00:00:58.591 line:5%,start
and you're telling me I can't afford you?

00:00:58.658 --> 00:00:59.726 line:5%,start
I did not say that.

00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:01.327 line:5%,start
-Right now--
-That's what you just told me.

00:01:21.047 --> 00:01:22.882 line:95%,end
an hour outside of Boston.

00:01:22.949 --> 00:01:26.319 line:95%,end
Some of the most prestigious dance studios
in the country are there--

00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:28.721 line:95%,end
tough schools, tough competitors.

00:01:28.788 --> 00:01:30.123 line:95%,end
And you really held your own.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.791 line:95%,end
You won that victory cup.

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:33.893 line:95%,end
You killed it. I'm very proud.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.929 line:95%,end
(applause)

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.832 line:95%,end
ABBY: Excellent. I'm very proud
of every one of you,

00:01:38.898 --> 00:01:40.600 line:95%,end
and you know I don't say that too often.

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:43.069 line:95%,end
I'm also am very proud that all
the moms kept their mouths shut

00:01:43.136 --> 00:01:44.737 line:95%,end
and didn't say anything to me.

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:47.941 line:95%,end
See how much nicer it is
when everything goes so smoothly?

00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:49.075 line:95%,end
It was wonderful.

00:01:49.142 --> 00:01:50.810 line:95%,end
Now if only the moms could learn

00:01:50.877 --> 00:01:52.712 line:95%,end
to be team players like their daughters,

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:54.147 line:95%,end
then we'd be in business.

00:01:54.214 --> 00:01:56.683 line:95%,end
I never saw such disorganization
in all my life.

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:58.284 line:95%,end
Go back to your studio!

00:01:58.351 --> 00:02:00.453 line:95%,end
You know what? I'm not. I'm here to stay,

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.488 line:95%,end
so like it.

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:04.691 line:95%,end
KELLY: I don't. Neither does anybody else.

00:02:06.626 --> 00:02:09.195 line:95%,end
Now let's talk about
this week's competition.

00:02:10.063 --> 00:02:13.399 line:95%,end
We are going to what?

00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:15.101 line:95%,end
CHILDREN: Starpower!

00:02:15.168 --> 00:02:19.439 line:95%,end
It's at the Mohegan Sun in Connecticut,
and it's a resort.

00:02:19.506 --> 00:02:21.207 line:95%,end
It's all self-contained.

00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:22.242 line:95%,end
We can't forget anything.

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:24.711 line:95%,end
So we will have a wardrobe for each day

00:02:24.777 --> 00:02:27.881 line:95%,end
that they are going to be there,
just like the old school days.

00:02:27.947 --> 00:02:28.915 line:95%,end
Yes?

00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:30.483 line:95%,end
And you will park here, in front of me,

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.051 line:95%,end
so that I know that you have everything.

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:34.587 line:95%,end
Let's talk about the board.

00:02:35.021 --> 00:02:38.625 line:95%,end
First of all, everybody
worked together as a team.

00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:41.327 line:95%,end
That teamwork is going
to help you at Nationals.

00:02:41.394 --> 00:02:43.196 line:95%,end
That's what's going
to put you over the top--

00:02:43.263 --> 00:02:45.064 line:95%,end
teamwork and technique.

00:02:45.131 --> 00:02:46.099 line:95%,end
Those are the two things

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:47.667 line:95%,end
that we're going to concentrate on
this week.

00:02:48.134 --> 00:02:49.102 line:95%,end
Moms...

00:02:50.203 --> 00:02:51.905 line:95%,end
we're doing another new number!

00:02:51.971 --> 00:02:54.641 line:95%,end
(cheering and applause)

00:02:54.707 --> 00:02:55.942 line:95%,end
One more costume!

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:59.445 line:5%,start
This week's group number
is entitled <i>Make You Mine.</i>

00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:01.814 line:95%,end
<i>It's a theatrical jazz routine.</i>

00:03:01.881 --> 00:03:04.684 line:95%,end
<i>It's upbeat, it's fun, classic jazz.</i>

00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:06.219 line:95%,end
This week, I'm going to ask you
to work harder

00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:08.154 line:95%,end
than you've ever worked before.

00:03:08.221 --> 00:03:11.457 line:95%,end
We need to show up and walk in there
like we own the place.

00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:13.927 line:95%,end
And I will give you a pack list
for clothes for the trip,

00:03:13.993 --> 00:03:16.829 line:95%,end
and I want them dressed
a certain way every single day

00:03:16.896 --> 00:03:17.931 line:95%,end
that we are there.

00:03:17.997 --> 00:03:20.600 line:95%,end
Does everyone understand that Yes?

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:22.535 line:95%,end
Moms, thank you very much.

00:03:22.602 --> 00:03:24.037 line:95%,end
Ladies, let's get up.

00:03:24.103 --> 00:03:25.171 line:95%,end
Let's go.

00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:26.973 line:5%,start
<i>Push through.</i>

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.308 line:5%,start
Tighten your abs.

00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:30.276 line:95%,end
Stronger arm. Stronger arm.

00:03:30.343 --> 00:03:31.511 line:95%,end
Stronger arm.

00:03:31.578 --> 00:03:32.745 line:95%,end
<i>PassÃ©.</i>

00:03:32.812 --> 00:03:34.414 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Vivi and Mackenzie
were still on the bottom of the board.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.049 line:95%,end
WOMAN: Yeah, I didn't like that, at all.

00:03:36.115 --> 00:03:37.951 line:95%,end
Because they were in the team that won.

00:03:38.017 --> 00:03:39.619 line:95%,end
-MELISSA: I--
-CATHY: Regardless of what they did,

00:03:39.686 --> 00:03:41.387 line:95%,end
-they contributed.
-Oh, I didn't even think about.

00:03:41.454 --> 00:03:44.190 line:95%,end
CATHY: And I thought that
that was really stinky.

00:03:44.257 --> 00:03:45.425 line:95%,end
MELISSA: They should have
put the babies on the top.

00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:47.126 line:95%,end
-That's right. It should have been--
-MELISSA: I mean, not the babies, but--

00:03:47.193 --> 00:03:48.995 line:95%,end
I mean, it's like,
god, don't ever give anybody

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:50.029 line:95%,end
-just a little inch.
-That's why Mackenzie

00:03:50.096 --> 00:03:51.064 line:95%,end
doesn't want to dance anymore.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.299 line:95%,end
She's like, it's always all
about all the other girls

00:03:53.366 --> 00:03:54.534 line:95%,end
and, you know--

00:03:54.601 --> 00:03:56.669 line:95%,end
Your ribs are open. Derriere is out.

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:58.538 line:95%,end
Tighten it. Tighten it, no squishy.

00:03:58.605 --> 00:04:02.008 line:95%,end
CATHY: And I just hope that
you guys are prepared with a costume,

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:04.811 line:95%,end
and that you guys stop sharing costumes.

00:04:04.877 --> 00:04:07.380 line:95%,end
Because, yeah,
there is so much of teamwork,

00:04:07.447 --> 00:04:10.450 line:95%,end
but it's ridiculous
when you're looking at a six-year-old

00:04:10.516 --> 00:04:13.253 line:95%,end
and you're thirteen,
to cram into her costume.

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:14.287 line:95%,end
No offense to you

00:04:14.354 --> 00:04:17.991 line:95%,end
because you were only doing
what she told you to do.

00:04:18.057 --> 00:04:20.994 line:95%,end
But I paid for the costumes
and I didn't like it.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.097 line:95%,end
So I think that, for now,
it's over and done with

00:04:24.163 --> 00:04:25.565 line:95%,end
and we need to move forward

00:04:25.632 --> 00:04:26.899 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>Cathy is acting like a bitch.</i>

00:04:26.966 --> 00:04:29.235 line:5%,start
And she was way out of line
whenever she came up to me

00:04:29.302 --> 00:04:30.770 line:5%,start
three numbers before Brooke went on stage

00:04:30.837 --> 00:04:32.839 line:95%,end
and took her costume off of her body.

00:04:32.905 --> 00:04:34.674 line:95%,end
But my advice, as a dance teacher,

00:04:34.741 --> 00:04:36.276 line:95%,end
you moms need to step up

00:04:36.342 --> 00:04:39.412 line:95%,end
and make sure that she's on top of things
with your costumes.

00:04:40.246 --> 00:04:41.948 line:95%,end
Vivi's very young

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:43.916 line:95%,end
and you're new,

00:04:43.983 --> 00:04:45.852 line:95%,end
so you're kind of still
in the honeymoon period.

00:04:45.918 --> 00:04:48.755 line:95%,end
So she may not take it out--
but give her--give her some time.

00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:50.356 line:95%,end
Then she'll start taking
out her frustrations

00:04:50.423 --> 00:04:51.858 line:95%,end
on you on your daughter.

00:04:51.924 --> 00:04:54.460 line:95%,end
Well, all I'm going to do is flash her
a couple of dead presidents.

00:04:54.527 --> 00:04:55.962 line:95%,end
Hopefully, that'll work.

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:57.664 line:95%,end
-WOMAN: (laughs)
-That'll settle her.


00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:58.698 line:95%,end
(indistinct chatter)

00:04:58.765 --> 00:05:01.334 line:95%,end
That'll settle her down right now,
some dead presidents.

00:05:01.401 --> 00:05:02.769 line:95%,end
-MELISSA: <i>That'll help her.</i>
-HOLLY: <i>That might work.</i>

00:05:02.835 --> 00:05:05.271 line:5%,start
(dramatic music playing)

00:05:05.338 --> 00:05:07.407 line:5%,start
ABBY: All right.
Now, remember, you're an angel.

00:05:07.473 --> 00:05:10.543 line:5%,start
So you need to be pretty and beautiful
with beautiful feet,

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.413 line:5%,start
not Fred Flintstone flat feet. Got it?

00:05:14.347 --> 00:05:18.084 line:5%,start
Maddie is doing a breathtakingly
gorgeous lyrical routine.

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:22.021 line:5%,start
It's entitled <i>Angel</i>,
and she wears a stunning white costume.

00:05:22.088 --> 00:05:25.091 line:95%,end
(jazz music playing)

00:05:29.095 --> 00:05:33.566 line:95%,end
SINGER: <i>âªYou are the sky,</i>
<i>the moon at night âª</i>

00:05:33.633 --> 00:05:38.204 line:95%,end
<i>âªYou are my life, a shining light âª</i>

00:05:38.271 --> 00:05:43.042 line:95%,end
<i>âªThese things, I've learned,</i>
<i>are never ending âª</i>

00:05:43.109 --> 00:05:45.211 line:95%,end
MADDIE: <i>I'm doing this dance called </i>Angel

00:05:45.278 --> 00:05:46.979 line:5%,start
for my grandmother, Babcia,

00:05:47.046 --> 00:05:48.247 line:5%,start
and I hope that she is proud.

00:05:48.314 --> 00:05:50.650 line:95%,end
<i>And I know that she is watching me</i>
<i>from heaven.</i>

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.387 line:95%,end
(indistinct singing)

00:05:54.454 --> 00:05:56.189 line:95%,end
You know that song <i>Angel </i>is for my mom?

00:05:56.255 --> 00:05:58.024 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I know. Maddie was telling me.

00:05:58.091 --> 00:05:59.592 line:95%,end
She's so excited about it.

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:03.529 line:95%,end
MELLISA: <i>My mom was diagnosed with cancer</i>
<i>when I was really young.</i>

00:06:03.596 --> 00:06:05.264 line:5%,start
And my mom meant the world to me.

00:06:05.331 --> 00:06:07.500 line:5%,start
Her and I were close,
just like Maddie and I are.

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:12.171 line:95%,end
The other day, I was a little freaked out

00:06:12.238 --> 00:06:13.673 line:95%,end
because, like, I smelled her.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.708 line:95%,end
And it was like--it was so weird.

00:06:15.775 --> 00:06:18.077 line:95%,end
You know, I look at a picture every day
when I get my coffee,

00:06:18.144 --> 00:06:21.214 line:95%,end
and you now, I have her little handwriting
on my cabinet,

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.281 line:95%,end
you know?

00:06:22.348 --> 00:06:24.450 line:95%,end
And I don't know. I just miss her so much,

00:06:24.517 --> 00:06:25.585 line:95%,end
I can't stand it.

00:06:25.651 --> 00:06:27.487 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Like, you think, like,
I want to pick up the phone and call them.

00:06:27.553 --> 00:06:28.554 line:95%,end
-And you're like--
-MELLISA: I still do it.

00:06:28.621 --> 00:06:30.456 line:95%,end
I sometimes say,
oh, I have to tell my mom about this.

00:06:30.523 --> 00:06:32.692 line:95%,end
You know?
And then I'm like, she's not there.

00:06:34.627 --> 00:06:36.596 line:95%,end
KELLY: I can't imagine
not having a parent.

00:06:36.662 --> 00:06:39.132 line:95%,end
Oh, I mean, I have nobody.

00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:43.770 line:95%,end
<i>When I look at Maddie I see my mom.</i>

00:06:43.836 --> 00:06:46.572 line:95%,end
<i>Because my mom had the blue eyes</i>
<i>that Maddie has.</i>

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:50.476 line:95%,end
And I always say to her,
my mom gave me you.

00:06:50.543 --> 00:06:52.111 line:95%,end
When she left me, she gave me you.

00:06:52.178 --> 00:06:54.714 line:95%,end
(jazz music playing)

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.556 line:5%,start
Chug, chug, chug, chug,

00:07:03.623 --> 00:07:04.857 line:5%,start
and you're moving forward a little bit.

00:07:04.924 --> 00:07:06.592 line:95%,end
But more hips--big.

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:11.164 line:95%,end
<i>Nia is doing a character piece</i>
<i>entitled </i>LaQuifa.

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:15.501 line:5%,start
It's sassy, it's snap,
and hip, and head pop.

00:07:15.568 --> 00:07:16.569 line:95%,end
Go.

00:07:18.371 --> 00:07:20.373 line:95%,end
See how you're, like, going
to fall when you finish?

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.042 line:95%,end
I don't want to see that.
Do it again. Push!

00:07:24.844 --> 00:07:26.446 line:95%,end
Staggering again. Come on.

00:07:26.512 --> 00:07:28.314 line:95%,end
<i>Nia is African-American,</i>

00:07:28.381 --> 00:07:32.185 line:95%,end
<i>and I'm trying to teach her</i>
<i>different ethnic dances.</i>

00:07:32.251 --> 00:07:35.888 line:95%,end
And I'm trying to train her
so that when she is in New York or LA

00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:37.824 line:95%,end
and the casting call says ethnic,

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:40.960 line:95%,end
<i>she can do all of the dances correctly.</i>

00:07:41.027 --> 00:07:43.930 line:95%,end
Your abdominal muscles, engage them.

00:07:43.996 --> 00:07:47.033 line:95%,end
Now march in your own circle,
nose up in the air.

00:07:47.099 --> 00:07:50.136 line:95%,end
Go. One, two, three, four.

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:54.407 line:95%,end
You're going to swing this down,
five, and fan kick big,

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:57.076 line:95%,end
forced arch flex, seven and eight.

00:07:57.143 --> 00:07:58.110 line:95%,end
Good.

00:07:58.177 --> 00:08:01.080 line:95%,end
Before I start another solo

00:08:01.147 --> 00:08:03.015 line:95%,end
and before I start yelling about your feet

00:08:03.082 --> 00:08:04.684 line:95%,end
and your legs being sloppy,

00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:07.587 line:95%,end
this is the difference
between winning and overall.

00:08:07.653 --> 00:08:10.923 line:95%,end
This is the difference
between winning a title right here--

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:12.024 line:95%,end
the technique.

00:08:12.525 --> 00:08:14.026 line:95%,end
Explain that word to me.

00:08:15.628 --> 00:08:17.396 line:95%,end
-Um--
-We use it all the time.

00:08:18.231 --> 00:08:19.532 line:95%,end
What does technique mean?

00:08:20.199 --> 00:08:24.237 line:95%,end
I think it means that you, um...

00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:26.305 line:95%,end
I really don't know.

00:08:26.372 --> 00:08:27.440 line:95%,end
You really don't know?

00:08:27.507 --> 00:08:29.575 line:95%,end
And how many times
have you heard it in dance?

00:08:29.642 --> 00:08:30.610 line:95%,end
A thousand times.

00:08:30.676 --> 00:08:31.844 line:95%,end
A thousand times.

00:08:32.445 --> 00:08:33.946 line:95%,end
If you were reading a book

00:08:34.013 --> 00:08:36.616 line:95%,end
and they used the word a thousand times
and you didn't understand it,

00:08:36.682 --> 00:08:38.684 line:95%,end
-wouldn't you go look up the word?
-Yeah.

00:08:38.751 --> 00:08:40.920 line:5%,start
Abby pushes me really hard,

00:08:40.987 --> 00:08:44.257 line:5%,start
but I don't mind
because it makes me a better dancer.

00:08:44.323 --> 00:08:45.725 line:95%,end
Go ahead out on the floor.

00:08:46.392 --> 00:08:48.995 line:95%,end
Let me see your best jump.

00:08:49.562 --> 00:08:50.997 line:95%,end
I know you're teaching until 7:30,

00:08:51.063 --> 00:08:53.165 line:95%,end
but I just wanted to warn you
that Dawn Check is here

00:08:53.232 --> 00:08:54.200 line:95%,end
to talk to you.

00:08:55.468 --> 00:08:57.270 line:95%,end
She should be here to pay her bill.

00:08:57.336 --> 00:08:58.738 line:95%,end
She's going to speak to you, so--

00:08:59.305 --> 00:09:01.173 line:95%,end
-ABBY: Okay. I'll be out in a few minutes.
-MELISSA: Okay.

00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:06.579 line:95%,end
Minister Dawn--she has a lot of nerve
showing up at my dance studio

00:09:06.646 --> 00:09:08.981 line:95%,end
after which she pulled the last time
she was there.

00:09:09.048 --> 00:09:11.984 line:95%,end
I mean, I can't believe
that she has the gall to show her face

00:09:12.051 --> 00:09:13.986 line:95%,end
after the police hauled her out of here.

00:09:14.353 --> 00:09:15.888 line:95%,end
Every week, we put the trash out.

00:09:15.955 --> 00:09:16.923 line:95%,end
Go!

00:09:17.523 --> 00:09:19.191 line:95%,end
Then take yourself out!

00:09:19.258 --> 00:09:21.894 line:95%,end
Because you're the biggest
piece of trash there is!

00:09:21.961 --> 00:09:24.163 line:95%,end
-May I have your phone?
-Call the police!

00:09:24.597 --> 00:09:26.599 line:95%,end
Go for it!

00:09:26.666 --> 00:09:27.967 line:95%,end
-I'm sorry, girls.
-DAWN: Go for it!

00:09:28.034 --> 00:09:29.402 line:95%,end
There's a psycho in every batch.

00:09:29.468 --> 00:09:31.203 line:95%,end
A psycho? Yes!

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:32.705 line:95%,end
Her name's Abigail Miller!

00:09:32.772 --> 00:09:34.607 line:95%,end
-ABBY: Hi. I need police.
-(siren blaring)

00:09:34.674 --> 00:09:37.677 line:95%,end
(indistinct chatter)

00:09:38.344 --> 00:09:39.545 line:95%,end
All right. You gotta go.

00:09:39.612 --> 00:09:41.080 line:95%,end
Take you daughter somewhere else then

00:09:41.147 --> 00:09:43.082 line:95%,end
if you don't like the dance company here.

00:09:45.318 --> 00:09:46.485 line:95%,end
This time, I'm prepared.

00:09:46.552 --> 00:09:48.688 line:95%,end
I have 911 on speed dial.

00:09:48.754 --> 00:09:51.891 line:95%,end
(tense music playing)


00:09:53.059 --> 00:09:55.194 line:5%,start
(tense music playing)

00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:57.196 line:5%,start
ABBY: ...seven and eight.

00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:58.965 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I know your teaching until 7:30,

00:09:59.031 --> 00:10:00.566 line:95%,end
but I just wanted to warn you

00:10:00.633 --> 00:10:03.469 line:5%,start
um, that Dawn Check is here
to talk to you.

00:10:03.536 --> 00:10:05.371 line:95%,end
She should be here to pay her bill.

00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:06.539 line:95%,end
Go somewhere else!

00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:09.041 line:95%,end
Take your money, take your kid,
take your socks,

00:10:09.108 --> 00:10:10.543 line:95%,end
find another school!

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.078 line:95%,end
-I am--
-Why are you right?

00:10:12.144 --> 00:10:13.112 line:95%,end
It's my building!

00:10:13.179 --> 00:10:14.814 line:95%,end
-My name's on the front of it!
-So what!

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.616 line:95%,end
-(screams) Quit chasing me!
-Go for it!

00:10:16.682 --> 00:10:18.718 line:95%,end
Hi. I need police.

00:10:18.784 --> 00:10:21.787 line:95%,end
I have an--a parent that's out of control.

00:10:22.221 --> 00:10:24.323 line:95%,end
-Have a seat.
-DAWN: I just thought it would be better

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:25.725 line:95%,end
if we spoke in person.

00:10:25.791 --> 00:10:27.259 line:95%,end
ABBY: I am busy, busy, busy, busy.

00:10:27.326 --> 00:10:31.230 line:95%,end
Okay. You never paid
for the rest of your solo.

00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:32.932 line:95%,end
-I didn't think you would come in.
-Yeah, I'm not going to do that.

00:10:33.699 --> 00:10:35.368 line:95%,end
Okay. Well, it needs to be paid.

00:10:35.434 --> 00:10:37.003 line:95%,end
This is your contract.

00:10:37.069 --> 00:10:38.137 line:95%,end
-DAWN: I understand.
-This is--this is--

00:10:38.204 --> 00:10:40.539 line:95%,end
But the contract was broken.

00:10:40.606 --> 00:10:41.574 line:95%,end
No.

00:10:42.375 --> 00:10:44.076 line:95%,end
When you throw me out
and tell me to get out

00:10:44.143 --> 00:10:45.344 line:95%,end
-and not come back...
-No.

00:10:45.411 --> 00:10:47.146 line:95%,end
-...that makes it broken.
-No, it doesn't.

00:10:47.213 --> 00:10:48.681 line:95%,end
You broke the contract.

00:10:48.748 --> 00:10:50.349 line:95%,end
I don't owe you anything.

00:10:50.416 --> 00:10:51.384 line:95%,end
I'll see you in court.

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:52.985 line:95%,end
Believe me, Dawn, I've done it before.

00:10:53.052 --> 00:10:55.354 line:95%,end
And you're going to have the court costs,

00:10:55.421 --> 00:10:57.189 line:95%,end
you're going to have my time in there--

00:10:57.256 --> 00:10:58.591 line:95%,end
Unless I win.

00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:00.292 line:95%,end
And then--then what happens?

00:11:00.359 --> 00:11:01.794 line:95%,end
How would you win?

00:11:01.861 --> 00:11:04.397 line:95%,end
Your daughter wore a costume,
took a picture in it,

00:11:04.463 --> 00:11:06.432 line:95%,end
and you're claiming
that you don't need to pay for it?

00:11:06.866 --> 00:11:09.402 line:95%,end
That's called fact by deception.

00:11:09.468 --> 00:11:12.138 line:95%,end
You can use all the words you want to use.

00:11:12.204 --> 00:11:13.806 line:95%,end
-I will.
-DAWN: But it's a breach of contract.

00:11:13.873 --> 00:11:15.241 line:95%,end
Okay. It's time for you to go.

00:11:15.307 --> 00:11:16.742 line:95%,end
Well, all right.

00:11:16.809 --> 00:11:17.943 line:95%,end
Have a nice day.

00:11:19.011 --> 00:11:22.081 line:5%,start
That Minister Dawn
needs a Bible refresher course.

00:11:22.148 --> 00:11:24.950 line:5%,start
Thou shall not lie, thou shall not steal,

00:11:25.017 --> 00:11:27.319 line:5%,start
and thou shall not disrespect Abby.

00:11:28.387 --> 00:11:29.522 line:5%,start
(quirky music playing)

00:11:29.588 --> 00:11:31.223 line:5%,start
Okay, ladies.

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:33.225 line:5%,start
This is your pack list
for the competition.

00:11:33.292 --> 00:11:35.428 line:5%,start
Now, I didn't get into too much detail,

00:11:35.494 --> 00:11:37.129 line:5%,start
since you guys go away all the time.

00:11:37.196 --> 00:11:39.465 line:5%,start
When we go to a competition,
everyone involved

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:42.201 line:5%,start
is representing me, Abby Lee Miller.

00:11:42.268 --> 00:11:45.538 line:95%,end
So I want my girls to look professional,

00:11:45.604 --> 00:11:47.573 line:95%,end
and I want the moms
to look professional, too.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.875 line:95%,end
Cathy, the reason we do this

00:11:49.942 --> 00:11:52.445 line:95%,end
is so it's easy for me to find the kids.

00:11:52.511 --> 00:11:55.381 line:95%,end
When I'm traveling with children
and I need to get them quickly--

00:11:55.448 --> 00:11:57.349 line:95%,end
I want to take a photo, somebody shows up

00:11:57.416 --> 00:11:59.351 line:95%,end
and then they all look good
for my program book.

00:11:59.418 --> 00:12:01.020 line:95%,end
CATHY: I'm all about themes,

00:12:01.087 --> 00:12:02.421 line:95%,end
but these little themed outfits

00:12:02.488 --> 00:12:04.857 line:95%,end
-are just for the children and not--
-ABBY: Oh, no, no, no, no.

00:12:04.924 --> 00:12:06.292 line:95%,end
They're for everyone attending.

00:12:09.795 --> 00:12:10.763 line:95%,end
Hold the phone for just a moment.

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:13.432 line:95%,end
Because we've already went shopping

00:12:13.499 --> 00:12:15.534 line:95%,end
and we've bought some fabulous clothes.

00:12:15.601 --> 00:12:18.204 line:95%,end
And I'm seeing here black
and white night time,

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:20.606 line:95%,end
and I'm going to assume
that you're talking about banquets.

00:12:20.673 --> 00:12:24.009 line:95%,end
And I have a fabulous fuchsia formal

00:12:24.076 --> 00:12:26.612 line:95%,end
that I'm going to be wearing,
and she has green.

00:12:28.047 --> 00:12:30.216 line:95%,end
<i>I'm sorry I can't follow Abby's rules.</i>

00:12:30.282 --> 00:12:33.619 line:5%,start
When Candy Apples steps out,
we do it in style.

00:12:33.686 --> 00:12:35.287 line:95%,end
We don't dress like the help.

00:12:35.354 --> 00:12:38.591 line:95%,end
You do remember
that I am not a team player.

00:12:38.657 --> 00:12:41.927 line:95%,end
And we will be packing at home.

00:12:42.828 --> 00:12:45.798 line:95%,end
And what we pack is what we're bringing.

00:12:45.865 --> 00:12:49.001 line:95%,end
-This may not be totally conducive--
-Do not make your child an outcast.

00:12:49.068 --> 00:12:51.403 line:95%,end
-Oh, we would love for Vivi to blend.
-ABBY: Yes.

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:54.106 line:95%,end
But the reason why we're here
is to stand out.

00:12:54.173 --> 00:12:56.375 line:5%,start
I'd like to say that I'm smarter
than the average bear.

00:12:56.442 --> 00:12:58.210 line:95%,end

<i>from underneath them</i>

00:12:58.277 --> 00:13:00.079 line:95%,end

<i>from what's going on,</i>

00:13:00.146 --> 00:13:01.714 line:95%,end
<i>so that I get in my way.</i>

00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:04.250 line:95%,end
All right. Everybody understands, yes?

00:13:04.316 --> 00:13:05.885 line:95%,end
Mothers, I have your word? Cathy?

00:13:05.951 --> 00:13:07.853 line:95%,end
Oh, well, I'll have to think about it.

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:10.923 line:95%,end
(tense music playing)

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:17.263 line:5%,start

-CATHY: Vivi.
-VIVI-ANNE: Hm?

00:13:20.332 --> 00:13:21.834 line:95%,end
You know what I found out?

00:13:21.901 --> 00:13:25.571 line:95%,end
At Starpower they have a costume award.

00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:28.307 line:95%,end
-VIVI-ANNE: Cool.
-And you have to put your photo in.

00:13:28.774 --> 00:13:32.378 line:95%,end
So I think that we're going
to enter your pink costume.

00:13:32.444 --> 00:13:35.314 line:95%,end
<i>At Starpower they have a photogenic award.</i>

00:13:35.381 --> 00:13:38.217 line:5%,start
I would love for Vivi to be able
to have the opportunity

00:13:38.284 --> 00:13:39.418 line:5%,start
to model in a costume book

00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:41.854 line:95%,end
because that's what I did
when I was little.

00:13:41.921 --> 00:13:44.490 line:95%,end
And it was a great experience,
very exciting.

00:13:44.557 --> 00:13:46.559 line:95%,end
And I think it would be wonderful to know

00:13:46.625 --> 00:13:48.861 line:95%,end
that her picture was going
all over the country.

00:13:48.928 --> 00:13:50.462 line:95%,end
-You know what else, too, Vivi?
-Hm?

00:13:50.529 --> 00:13:52.097 line:95%,end
There will probably be a lot

00:13:52.164 --> 00:13:53.999 line:95%,end
-of photographers there.
-Okay.

00:13:54.066 --> 00:13:55.434 line:95%,end
CATHY: It'll be like
you're the glamour girl.

00:13:55.501 --> 00:13:56.602 line:95%,end
-Uh-huh.
-CATHY: Okay?

00:13:56.669 --> 00:13:57.770 line:95%,end
That'd be fun.

00:13:58.237 --> 00:13:59.839 line:95%,end
Maybe Mommy can get in a couple of shots.

00:13:59.905 --> 00:14:00.873 line:95%,end
VIVI-ANNE: Yeah.

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:03.175 line:95%,end
<i>My mom wants me to be famous.</i>

00:14:03.642 --> 00:14:05.477 line:5%,start
I don't want to be a model.

ABBY: All right, girls, the new number

00:14:15.354 --> 00:14:17.256 line:5%,start
that we're going to do
for this competition

00:14:17.323 --> 00:14:19.258 line:5%,start
is called <i>Make You Mine.</i>

00:14:19.325 --> 00:14:20.459 line:5%,start
Everybody say that.

00:14:20.526 --> 00:14:22.061 line:5%,start
CHILDREN: Make you mine.

00:14:22.127 --> 00:14:23.229 line:95%,end
I want you to go out,

00:14:23.295 --> 00:14:25.764 line:95%,end
and I want you to get
the older girls' black chairs.

00:14:25.831 --> 00:14:29.201 line:5%,start
This week's group number
is entitled <i>Make You Mine.</i>

00:14:29.635 --> 00:14:30.936 line:95%,end
<i>And we use the chairs</i>

00:14:31.003 --> 00:14:32.638 line:95%,end
<i>because the kids have done a Fosse</i> number

00:14:32.705 --> 00:14:34.740 line:95%,end
<i>and they were familiar</i>
<i>with working on the chairs.</i>

00:14:34.807 --> 00:14:37.743 line:95%,end
<i>It's high energy,</i>
<i>and the kids love the number.</i>

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:39.845 line:95%,end
<i>They get to dance like teenagers,</i>
<i>so they love it.</i>

00:14:39.912 --> 00:14:42.982 line:95%,end
SINGER: <i>âªSlip my lace on,</i>

00:14:43.048 --> 00:14:45.150 line:95%,end
One, two,

00:14:45.217 --> 00:14:47.887 line:95%,end
three, four--jetÃ©.

00:14:47.953 --> 00:14:48.921 line:95%,end
Roll.

00:14:52.892 --> 00:14:53.893 line:95%,end
Turn that foot out, Nia!

00:14:53.959 --> 00:14:55.594 line:95%,end
Arms, up straight!

00:14:58.864 --> 00:15:00.699 line:95%,end
One, two, arms, Nia!

00:15:00.766 --> 00:15:02.701 line:95%,end
Three--where are those arms?

00:15:03.369 --> 00:15:05.104 line:95%,end
Last night at dinner with your dad--

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:06.338 line:95%,end
that's where the arms are.

00:15:06.405 --> 00:15:09.241 line:95%,end
SINGER: <i>âªI'm your fantasy girl âª</i>

00:15:10.542 --> 00:15:12.678 line:95%,end
It's so frustrating to watch Nia dance.

00:15:12.745 --> 00:15:15.347 line:95%,end
She makes the same mistakes
over and over again.

00:15:18.117 --> 00:15:19.785 line:95%,end
Pop up! I want it strong!

00:15:19.852 --> 00:15:22.154 line:95%,end
This is the third time in 20 minutes

00:15:22.221 --> 00:15:23.956 line:95%,end
I'm telling you the same thing.

00:15:24.023 --> 00:15:26.091 line:95%,end
<i>I don't know what I'm going to do</i>
<i>about Nia.</i>

00:15:26.158 --> 00:15:27.860 line:95%,end
If she doesn't step it up,
she's going to blow it

00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:29.261 line:95%,end
for the rest of the girls in the group.

00:15:29.828 --> 00:15:31.363 line:95%,end
You're the last one.

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:33.966 line:95%,end
And it was 100%, 100%,

00:15:34.033 --> 00:15:36.802 line:95%,end
100%, 100%, 50%.

00:15:36.869 --> 00:15:38.637 line:95%,end
One more time, do it.

00:15:39.104 --> 00:15:41.974 line:95%,end
One, two, three, four, five.

00:15:42.041 --> 00:15:43.242 line:95%,end
It's still not sharp enough.

00:15:43.309 --> 00:15:44.643 line:95%,end
It has to come up.

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:46.645 line:95%,end
Watch it when the next group does it.

00:15:46.712 --> 00:15:47.846 line:95%,end
Ready? Let's go.

00:15:48.781 --> 00:15:52.818 line:95%,end
SINGER: <i>âªSo we can get it on,</i>
<i>I'm going to make you mine âª</i>

00:15:55.821 --> 00:15:59.024 line:5%,start
I try to do everything right,
but sometimes it's too hard.

00:15:59.091 --> 00:16:00.926 line:95%,end
Five, six, seven, eight

00:16:00.993 --> 00:16:03.929 line:95%,end
and a one, two, three--

00:16:06.131 --> 00:16:09.068 line:95%,end
(quirky music playing)

00:16:09.468 --> 00:16:10.936 line:95%,end
I have costumes!

00:16:11.003 --> 00:16:12.271 line:95%,end
(cheering and applause)

00:16:12.338 --> 00:16:14.873 line:95%,end
-WOMAN: Oh, girls, look at that!
-Woo-hoo!

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:18.077 line:95%,end
All right, Nia, you're going
to put this on first, sweetie.

00:16:18.143 --> 00:16:19.912 line:95%,end
<i>The costume is darling.</i>

00:16:19.979 --> 00:16:24.149 line:5%,start
It's really, like, a satire
on the drag queen image.

00:16:24.216 --> 00:16:26.785 line:5%,start
And it's over the top,
and it's fun, fun, fun.

00:16:26.852 --> 00:16:28.387 line:95%,end
And it's right up Nia's alley.

00:16:28.454 --> 00:16:31.023 line:95%,end
Then, put the pants, and the crop top,

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:33.025 line:95%,end
and everything else on, after that.

00:16:33.092 --> 00:16:35.394 line:95%,end
NIA: <i>I loved my costume for </i>LaQuifa.

00:16:35.461 --> 00:16:37.629 line:5%,start
I thought it was amazing. (laughs)

00:16:37.696 --> 00:16:40.399 line:5%,start
Chloe, this is you.
Again, it's not what I drew.

00:16:40.466 --> 00:16:42.301 line:95%,end
I should have sent the fabric.

00:16:42.368 --> 00:16:43.635 line:95%,end
Hello. Sorry.

00:16:43.702 --> 00:16:45.004 line:95%,end
-Hi.
-HOLLY: Hi.

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:46.672 line:95%,end
<i>I arrived just in time for costumes,</i>

00:16:46.739 --> 00:16:48.440 line:5%,start
and it's always interesting to see

00:16:48.507 --> 00:16:50.642 line:5%,start
what Abby will pull
out of her bag of tricks.

00:16:50.709 --> 00:16:52.411 line:95%,end
Girls! Brooke!

00:16:52.478 --> 00:16:54.046 line:95%,end
-Oh, we're not too bad.
-KELLY: Oh, my gosh.

00:16:54.113 --> 00:16:55.314 line:95%,end
You're a lot bigger than we think!

00:16:55.381 --> 00:16:58.017 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: OK. I know it's--oh, my god, Nia!

00:16:58.083 --> 00:17:00.185 line:95%,end
-HOLLY: You know what? Let me--
-(laughter)

00:17:00.252 --> 00:17:01.286 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Was it hard to get in?

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:03.589 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Why is my daughter the only one

00:17:03.655 --> 00:17:05.591 line:95%,end
dressed in animal print?

00:17:05.657 --> 00:17:06.925 line:95%,end
Is this a joke?

00:17:07.493 --> 00:17:09.828 line:95%,end
ABBY: Can you walk down there, sweetie,
and let me see you?

00:17:10.462 --> 00:17:12.631 line:95%,end
HOLLY: All the other girls
get feminine, beautiful,

00:17:12.698 --> 00:17:15.801 line:95%,end
whimsical costumes
that aren't typecasting them.

00:17:16.402 --> 00:17:19.004 line:95%,end
And, you know what? I want her in an Afro.

00:17:19.071 --> 00:17:22.408 line:95%,end
Do you have one from when we did
<i>My Hair Looks Fierce?</i>

00:17:22.474 --> 00:17:23.909 line:95%,end
Let me just pull it out of my purse.

00:17:23.976 --> 00:17:26.478 line:95%,end
No, I don't have a Afro!
Oh, my... (laughing)

00:17:26.545 --> 00:17:29.114 line:95%,end
If not, Penn Hill Shopping Center.

00:17:29.181 --> 00:17:30.749 line:95%,end
You don't have an afro in your purse?

00:17:31.583 --> 00:17:33.118 line:95%,end
I just--I just changed purses.

00:17:33.185 --> 00:17:34.153 line:95%,end
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

00:17:34.219 --> 00:17:35.621 line:95%,end
No, I don't have an Afro.

00:17:36.021 --> 00:17:39.091 line:95%,end
<i>That's not the black experience</i>
<i>that we know.</i>

00:17:39.158 --> 00:17:41.727 line:95%,end
And there's nothing wrong with LaQuifa--

00:17:41.794 --> 00:17:43.295 line:95%,end
the LaQuifas of the world.

00:17:43.362 --> 00:17:45.297 line:95%,end
<i>But that's not Nia's experience.</i>

00:17:45.364 --> 00:17:46.498 line:95%,end
<i>It is not my experience.</i>

00:17:46.565 --> 00:17:48.200 line:95%,end
My name is Holly.

00:17:48.267 --> 00:17:51.236 line:95%,end
I'm as far away from LaQuifa
as you can get.

00:17:51.303 --> 00:17:54.573 line:95%,end
That is not who I am
and that is not who Nia is.

00:17:56.508 --> 00:17:57.476 line:95%,end
ABBY: Turn around.

00:17:58.043 --> 00:18:00.679 line:95%,end
<i>Holly wants her daughter</i>
<i>to be like every other little girl.</i>

00:18:00.746 --> 00:18:03.582 line:5%,start
Nia has an advantage over everybody else.

00:18:03.649 --> 00:18:06.085 line:5%,start
She can play many different ethnicities.

00:18:06.151 --> 00:18:10.155 line:95%,end
And it's my job to make her
capitalize those opportunities.

00:18:10.222 --> 00:18:11.857 line:95%,end
<i>Different is good.</i>

00:18:11.924 --> 00:18:15.027 line:95%,end
<i>She has what it takes,</i>
<i>and yet her mom wants her</i>

00:18:15.094 --> 00:18:17.663 line:95%,end
<i>to be like Paige, and Maddie, and Chloe.</i>

00:18:17.729 --> 00:18:19.098 line:95%,end
This is show business.

00:18:19.164 --> 00:18:21.133 line:95%,end
When they're looking
for somebody different,

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.401 line:95%,end
they're going to love Nia.

00:18:23.168 --> 00:18:24.770 line:95%,end
I think these could go a little higher.


00:18:27.339 --> 00:18:30.042 line:95%,end
(dramatic music playing)

00:18:33.145 --> 00:18:34.713 line:5%,start
I can't take all the late night.

00:18:38.117 --> 00:18:39.218 line:5%,start
I never drink.

00:18:39.284 --> 00:18:41.153 line:5%,start
But after having to buy an Afro

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:43.122 line:95%,end
<i>and seeing that Leopard costume,</i>

00:18:43.188 --> 00:18:44.890 line:95%,end
I about had it.

00:18:44.957 --> 00:18:48.327 line:95%,end
What I took objection to was
just about the whole LaQuifa number.

00:18:48.393 --> 00:18:51.463 line:95%,end
I never have denied my Black heritage.
I'm very proud of it.

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:53.332 line:95%,end
But it has to--I don't want
to be a stereotypical

00:18:53.398 --> 00:18:55.100 line:95%,end
-from the '70s wearing an Afro.
-And I agree with that.

00:18:55.167 --> 00:18:56.869 line:95%,end
We're in the 21st century.

00:18:56.935 --> 00:18:59.271 line:5%,start
KELLY: I think Holly's
being a little overdramatic.

00:18:59.338 --> 00:19:01.206 line:5%,start
Her daughter's wearing an Afro wig.

00:19:01.273 --> 00:19:02.407 line:95%,end
<i>What's the big deal?</i>

00:19:02.474 --> 00:19:03.909 line:95%,end
She's going to have her picking cotton.

00:19:03.976 --> 00:19:07.079 line:95%,end
Might as well, or a scarf on her head
and being Aunt Jemima.

00:19:07.146 --> 00:19:09.448 line:95%,end
-I don't want that.
-Did you just say picking cotton?

00:19:09.515 --> 00:19:10.749 line:95%,end
-HOLLY: Well, that's what it's like.
-(laughter)

00:19:10.816 --> 00:19:11.783 line:95%,end
It's the same type of thing.

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:13.118 line:95%,end
Swing low sweet chariot,

00:19:13.185 --> 00:19:14.620 line:95%,end
and just let's pick some cotton
or something.

00:19:14.686 --> 00:19:16.088 line:95%,end
-KELLY: It doesn't--like--
-We have worked so hard

00:19:16.155 --> 00:19:17.723 line:95%,end
-to get beyond that.
-KELLY: I agree with you.

00:19:17.789 --> 00:19:19.625 line:95%,end
HOLLY: <i>For me, it's very political.</i>

00:19:19.691 --> 00:19:22.361 line:5%,start
Politics is all about who has to power
and who has the control.

00:19:22.427 --> 00:19:24.463 line:95%,end
<i>I don't have the power</i>
<i>to choose Nia's music.</i>

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:25.764 line:95%,end
<i>Abby gets to choose that.</i>

00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:28.500 line:95%,end
And Abby has the control
and the power in depicting

00:19:28.567 --> 00:19:30.035 line:95%,end
how she wants Nia portrayed.

00:19:30.102 --> 00:19:32.371 line:95%,end
I'm definitely frustrated.
I'm at the end of my rope.

00:19:32.437 --> 00:19:35.340 line:95%,end
I don't know if I'm going to be able
to hang in there much longer.

You're throwing everybody
around back here.

We're heading to the Starpower

So get the makeup on
as quickly as possible

00:21:37.162 --> 00:21:38.664 line:95%,end
so that we have time to run this number.

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:39.698 line:95%,end
That's more important.

00:21:39.765 --> 00:21:41.533 line:95%,end

how's it feel?

-Not really.

MELLISA: Maddie, listen to me.


00:21:47.439 --> 00:21:48.940 line:95%,end
You have to cooperate with me.

00:21:49.007 --> 00:21:50.008 line:95%,end
But it's not right.

00:21:50.075 --> 00:21:52.811 line:95%,end

00:21:57.683 --> 00:21:58.750 line:95%,end
It was crazy.

00:22:00.619 --> 00:22:03.355 line:95%,end
Maddie, you have one number
to dance and that's it.

00:22:03.922 --> 00:22:04.923 line:95%,end
You're going to deal with it.

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:06.091 line:95%,end
Be a grownup.

00:22:07.592 --> 00:22:08.860 line:95%,end
I'm sick of this attitude.

00:22:08.927 --> 00:22:11.196 line:5%,start
I can't deal with Maddie's attitude.

00:22:11.263 --> 00:22:13.932 line:5%,start
She's eight years old
and sometimes she thinks she's 16.

00:22:14.633 --> 00:22:17.302 line:95%,end
-Maddie, you need earrings first.
-Not those.

00:22:17.369 --> 00:22:20.005 line:95%,end
No. Maddie, calm down, please.

00:22:20.072 --> 00:22:21.273 line:5%,start

Do you want to go home?

00:22:27.245 --> 00:22:29.081 line:95%,end
You're never like this. Stop it.

I feel bad for Maddie.

ABBY: Maddie, go do some turns
and see if that hair moves, please.

00:22:45.397 --> 00:22:48.867 line:5%,start
And when that doesn't happen
exactly as she planned,

00:22:48.934 --> 00:22:50.369 line:5%,start
then she gets worked up.

00:22:50.435 --> 00:22:52.237 line:95%,end
And that, in turn, works up her daughters.

00:22:52.304 --> 00:22:53.905 line:95%,end
Girls--sh, stop.

You're the first thing you're going

Be respectful backstage.

When you come off the stage,

I don't care if it was good,
bad or otherwise.

You act like it was the best time
you ever danced.

This is what we have been
working for all season.

Big smile.

00:26:59.017 --> 00:27:02.520 line:95%,end

she really started to perform,

It's much more difficult
to do a group routine.

00:27:27.178 --> 00:27:28.980 line:5%,start
Everybody has to be in sync,

Let me see.

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:26.037 line:95%,end
I just want to tell you that Babcia
would have been so proud of you.

00:28:26.504 --> 00:28:28.273 line:95%,end
You know, her and I
were close like you and I,

00:28:28.339 --> 00:28:30.608 line:95%,end
except we didn't fight
like you and I fight.

00:28:30.675 --> 00:28:31.643 line:95%,end
(laughs)

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:33.712 line:95%,end
Because you're too much
of a perfectionist.

00:28:33.778 --> 00:28:35.280 line:95%,end
But she meant so much to me.

00:28:35.346 --> 00:28:37.382 line:95%,end
She was my best friend,
like you and I are.

00:28:37.449 --> 00:28:39.417 line:95%,end
That's why you remind me so much of her.

00:28:40.151 --> 00:28:41.686 line:95%,end
She loved angels, you know?

00:28:41.753 --> 00:28:44.322 line:95%,end
And when she died, I took her hat--

00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:45.957 line:95%,end
you know the angels that we always put on?

00:28:46.024 --> 00:28:48.126 line:95%,end
But this is the special--
most special angel.

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:52.030 line:95%,end
This was her favorite little angel,
so let's pin it on you. okay?

00:28:53.131 --> 00:28:56.401 line:95%,end
<i>My mom wore this pin on her hat</i>
<i>every day when she had cancer.</i>

00:28:56.468 --> 00:28:59.537 line:5%,start
And she would have loved to see my kids
dance the way they dance.

00:28:59.604 --> 00:29:02.607 line:5%,start
And giving this pin to my daughter
means the world to me.


00:29:02.674 --> 00:29:04.509 line:95%,end
Do you know, whenever you go on stage

00:29:04.576 --> 00:29:07.011 line:95%,end
I always pray for her
to be on stage with you.

00:29:07.612 --> 00:29:11.216 line:95%,end
I totally believe that my mom
is always with my daughter

00:29:11.282 --> 00:29:13.284 line:95%,end
when she's on stage, always.

00:29:13.351 --> 00:29:14.753 line:95%,end
Do really good today, okay?

00:29:14.819 --> 00:29:16.421 line:95%,end
And think of her when you're on stage.

00:29:16.488 --> 00:29:17.722 line:95%,end
She'll be there with you.

00:29:17.789 --> 00:29:19.624 line:95%,end
(chuckles) I love me so much.

'70s Party Afro.

00:31:28.987 --> 00:31:30.922 line:95%,end
You should have seen the woman
at the store, "Is that for you?"

00:31:31.389 --> 00:31:33.758 line:5%,start
It's offensive that Abby asked me

00:31:33.825 --> 00:31:35.426 line:5%,start
to go out and buy an Afro wig.

00:31:52.677 --> 00:31:55.747 line:5%,start
The solo that she's now doing,
she's got an Afro wig on

00:31:55.813 --> 00:32:00.018 line:5%,start

LaQuifa, somebody.

00:32:00.084 --> 00:32:01.686 line:95%,end

to be not politically correct.

Holly is a little hysterical
over this, I think.

00:32:11.729 --> 00:32:15.500 line:95%,end
I think that this is starting

00:32:15.566 --> 00:32:18.136 line:95%,end
Don't you let that affect you.
Because you know what?

00:32:18.202 --> 00:32:20.238 line:95%,end
You are going to go out and just smash it.

00:32:20.305 --> 00:32:22.340 line:95%,end
-Right. See?
-See? You're going to kill it.

00:32:23.041 --> 00:32:24.609 line:95%,end

Brooke could do.

Like, Brooke could do a lyrical number,

00:32:38.056 --> 00:32:39.457 line:95%,end
but Abby just doesn't give it to her

00:32:39.524 --> 00:32:41.292 line:95%,end
because she's typed as an acro.

00:32:41.359 --> 00:32:43.227 line:95%,end

She deserves to be in that dance.

At the same time, I don't feel comfortable

any of those three places.

I'm going to tell you what.
That photographer--

00:35:51.649 --> 00:35:53.784 line:95%,end
no wonder he's working at competitions.

00:35:53.851 --> 00:35:55.419 line:95%,end
Because he's no professional.

00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:57.855 line:95%,end
You don't even look like you're smiling.

00:35:57.922 --> 00:35:59.624 line:95%,end
I should have had red lipstick on you.

00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:01.592 line:95%,end
The photographer was a goof.

00:36:01.659 --> 00:36:03.227 line:95%,end
Despite how bad he was,

00:36:03.294 --> 00:36:05.863 line:95%,end
the judges should have
seen the potential in Vivi.

00:36:06.697 --> 00:36:08.166 line:95%,end
These are horrendous.

00:36:08.232 --> 00:36:11.068 line:95%,end
I mean, no, you're beautiful.

00:36:11.903 --> 00:36:13.037 line:95%,end
But these pictures--

00:36:13.104 --> 00:36:15.206 line:95%,end

Those dances come from a heritage,

HOLLY: It was very disappointing.

00:37:44.095 --> 00:37:46.063 line:95%,end
I came to see a dance

across the stage, beautifully.

00:37:48.065 --> 00:37:51.302 line:95%,end
It was entertaining,

and have a heart-to-heart with Abby now.

00:38:06.384 --> 00:38:10.054 line:95%,end
It's still really unnerving for me
that she's wearing a wig.

It's 2011
and she's wearing a '70s Afro wig.

00:38:13.624 --> 00:38:17.094 line:95%,end
It's the whole idea it's an Afro,
it just seems so stereotypical.

00:38:17.161 --> 00:38:19.230 line:95%,end
It is stereotypical, absolutely.

00:38:20.531 --> 00:38:22.500 line:95%,end
I just feel like
she's the token black kid.

00:38:22.566 --> 00:38:23.901 line:95%,end
I wouldn't use the word token.

00:38:23.968 --> 00:38:25.536 line:95%,end
I would use the word...

00:38:35.913 --> 00:38:39.450 line:95%,end
If I send her to an audition,
it's going to be an ethnic call.

00:38:40.151 --> 00:38:42.753 line:95%,end
Nobody else is going to get to go but her.

I'm looking at Nia.

00:38:48.859 --> 00:38:52.630 line:95%,end
All of her routines,
it seems, is like, a jungle theme.

00:38:52.697 --> 00:38:54.465 line:95%,end
There's a Satan theme.

00:38:54.532 --> 00:38:56.834 line:95%,end
It's like, there's a little undertone,
a nuance that

00:38:56.901 --> 00:38:58.836 line:95%,end
is like, a little bit of a negativity,

00:38:58.903 --> 00:39:01.172 line:95%,end
that I would just like something
that's a little bit more celebratory.

00:39:02.306 --> 00:39:03.808 line:95%,end
Well, then you pick the music,

00:39:03.874 --> 00:39:06.544 line:95%,end
and you hire the choreographer,
and she can do the number.

00:39:08.212 --> 00:39:09.680 line:95%,end
Abby, we don't have to go there.

00:39:09.747 --> 00:39:10.915 line:95%,end

What I'm giving her works
for her movements,

00:39:14.485 --> 00:39:15.753 line:95%,end
for what she does well.

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:17.054 line:95%,end
She doesn't have good feet.

00:39:17.121 --> 00:39:18.456 line:95%,end
She doesn't have great turnout.

00:39:18.522 --> 00:39:20.991 line:95%,end
She doesn't straighten her knees.
She's sway back.

00:39:21.058 --> 00:39:23.361 line:95%,end
I'm telling you very nicely,
pick the music,

00:39:23.427 --> 00:39:25.596 line:95%,end
-pick the choreographer--nobody...
-Abby, come on. That's not fair.

00:39:25.663 --> 00:39:28.566 line:95%,end
...but not one kid pays me $30
grand a year.

00:39:29.333 --> 00:39:32.269 line:95%,end
And if you do, I will be a lot nicer

00:39:32.336 --> 00:39:34.071 line:95%,end
and I'll sit down
and we can have a big conference about it.

00:39:34.138 --> 00:39:36.173 line:95%,end
-Well, you know what?
-But for $250 bucks a month,

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:37.575 line:95%,end
go somewhere else.

00:39:37.641 --> 00:39:39.710 line:95%,end
-That's the way it is.
-First of all, I don't pay $250 a month.

00:39:39.777 --> 00:39:40.911 line:95%,end
-That's the first thing.
-To me, you do.

00:39:40.978 --> 00:39:42.046 line:95%,end
HOLLY: No, I don't.

00:39:42.113 --> 00:39:44.215 line:95%,end
Look how I dress. Look where I live.
Look what I pay.

00:39:44.281 --> 00:39:48.352 line:95%,end
I pay what--almost $100,000 a year
in private school tuition

00:39:48.419 --> 00:39:49.820 line:95%,end
and you're telling me I can't afford you?

00:39:49.887 --> 00:39:52.490 line:95%,end

-Pretty much, you did.

00:39:52.556 --> 00:39:55.025 line:95%,end

-And you have my kid dress up in an Afro?

-Let's not go there.
-ABBY: I did not say that.

I am Ivy League educated

she's not ethnicity first.
