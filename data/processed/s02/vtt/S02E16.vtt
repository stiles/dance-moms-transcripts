MELISSA:
Christi is taking Chloe out of school,

00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:16.049 line:5%,start
and then she's taking her to the movies.

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:17.250 line:5%,start
ABBY: You know what the rule is.

00:00:17.317 --> 00:00:18.752 line:5%,start
You're not in class, no solo.

00:00:18.818 --> 00:00:19.919 line:5%,start
She was at the doctor.

00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:23.523 line:5%,start

Foul language or unsportsmanlike behavior

MELISSA: <i>Mackenzie can't do this solo.</i>
<i>She's not ready.</i>

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:39.906 line:5%,start
ABBY: If I was competing in two days,

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:43.076 line:5%,start
I'd have a headset on and I'd be doing
that dance in my head a million times.

00:00:46.513 --> 00:00:49.349 line:5%,start

MELISSA: These mothers
are calling my daughter a cheater

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:52.352 line:5%,start
for last weekend.

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:56.489 line:5%,start
They said that she practiced
her dance with that music.

00:00:56.556 --> 00:00:58.191 line:5%,start
Did you cheat for my daughter?

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:46.272 line:5%,start
But I'm back because my girls
want to dance with their friends,

00:01:46.339 --> 00:01:47.607 line:5%,start
and that's what they're going to do.

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:50.944 line:5%,start
ABBY: First, we have Brooke.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.213 line:5%,start
Probation, no solo this week.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.682 line:5%,start
Paige, same thing.

00:01:56.015 --> 00:01:58.985 line:5%,start
BROOKE: I don't think it's fair
that Abby put my sister and I

00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:03.590 line:5%,start
on probation because we had nothing to do
with the argument my mom and her had.

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:05.825 line:95%,end
Brooke, Paige,
you didn't do your routines.

00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:07.127 line:95%,end
Nobody got to see them.

00:02:07.494 --> 00:02:09.562 line:95%,end

KELLY: I think that Abby thinks
that she's hurting me

00:02:19.772 --> 00:02:21.307 line:95%,end
by putting my kids on probation.

00:02:21.374 --> 00:02:24.144 line:95%,end
They didn't not do their solos
because they weren't prepared.

00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:25.945 line:95%,end
Where are the stoppers?

00:02:26.713 --> 00:02:28.281 line:95%,end
I'll have them for the competition.

00:02:30.016 --> 00:02:31.551 line:95%,end
-Done!
-HOLLY: Go get Paige.

00:02:31.618 --> 00:02:33.186 line:95%,end
-I'm going to (bleep) kill her.
-HOLLY: Aw.

00:02:33.253 --> 00:02:34.454 line:95%,end
ABBY: You're--you're finished.

00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:36.222 line:95%,end
Neither of my kids are doing
your group dance.

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:37.624 line:95%,end
You're not doing a solo.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:38.892 line:95%,end
Let's go, Brooke.

00:02:39.292 --> 00:02:41.728 line:95%,end
They didn't do their solos
because of unfair treatment.

00:02:41.794 --> 00:02:44.297 line:95%,end
Well, regardless, it doesn't matter.

00:02:44.597 --> 00:02:46.299 line:95%,end
<i>Kelly was out of control.</i>

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:51.070 line:95%,end
She used vulgarity and profanity
in the dance studio, therefore,

00:02:51.137 --> 00:02:53.306 line:95%,end
<i>those two kids were on probation.</i>

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:55.508 line:95%,end
Chloe.

00:02:55.575 --> 00:02:57.777 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: For two weeks, my daughter
has been at the top of the pyramid.

00:02:57.844 --> 00:02:59.946 line:5%,start
And she misses one rehearsal
and she goes straight

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:01.014 line:95%,end
<i>to the bottom row.</i>

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.715 line:95%,end
Sure, Abby, that's fair.

00:03:02.782 --> 00:03:04.551 line:95%,end
Last Monday you went to the doctor,

00:03:04.617 --> 00:03:05.919 line:95%,end
then you went to the movies.

00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:07.287 line:95%,end
That's ridiculous.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.722 line:95%,end
You need to be in class,
not at the movie theater.

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:12.158 line:95%,end
I don't know if Chloe
really went to the doctors

00:03:12.225 --> 00:03:14.727 line:95%,end
or if she was playing hooky
and went to the movies.

00:03:14.794 --> 00:03:18.097 line:95%,end
All I do know is
you're on the bottom row, kid.

00:03:18.164 --> 00:03:20.099 line:95%,end
Mackenzie did a great job,

00:03:20.967 --> 00:03:24.337 line:95%,end
but it's still wasn't your best.

00:03:25.071 --> 00:03:27.006 line:95%,end
You need to be in more ballet classes.

00:03:29.008 --> 00:03:30.610 line:95%,end
Nia, you're here

00:03:30.677 --> 00:03:35.014 line:95%,end
because you worked very well
with Mackenzie.

00:03:35.081 --> 00:03:36.015 line:95%,end
I gave you a role.

00:03:36.082 --> 00:03:37.550 line:95%,end
You were the ringmaster in a circus.

00:03:37.951 --> 00:03:39.919 line:95%,end
Some may say
it's a little immature for you,

00:03:39.986 --> 00:03:42.488 line:95%,end
but I love the fact that you embraced it,

00:03:42.555 --> 00:03:43.923 line:95%,end
that you had fun with it,


00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.792 line:95%,end
and that you were entertaining
to the audience.

00:03:45.858 --> 00:03:48.995 line:5%,start
HOLLY: Nia's place on the pyramid,
it means a lot to her.

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:52.532 line:5%,start
And seeing herself on the second row,
I'm happy for her.

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.701 line:95%,end
<i>I'm happy to see that joy in her eyes.</i>

00:03:54.767 --> 00:03:57.804 line:95%,end
ABBY: And, at the top of the pyramid,
we have Maddie.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.306 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>I'm really not surprised</i>
<i>that Maddie's at the top of the pyramid.</i>

00:04:00.373 --> 00:04:01.908 line:95%,end
Abby has been looking for a reason

00:04:01.975 --> 00:04:03.209 line:95%,end
to put her back up there.

00:04:03.276 --> 00:04:06.112 line:95%,end
ABBY: You stepped out on stage,
you started your routine,

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:07.480 line:95%,end
and your music skipped.

00:04:07.847 --> 00:04:09.882 line:95%,end
(music skipping)

00:04:11.484 --> 00:04:13.586 line:95%,end
(cheering and applause)

00:04:13.653 --> 00:04:15.021 line:95%,end
You didn't let it get the best of you.

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:16.389 line:95%,end
You stayed out there, you kept going,

00:04:16.456 --> 00:04:18.091 line:95%,end
and you finished without missing a beat.

00:04:18.458 --> 00:04:20.293 line:95%,end
You really had the audience behind you.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.161 line:95%,end
So I don't know what happened with the CD.

00:04:22.228 --> 00:04:23.496 line:95%,end
It just scratched.

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:25.832 line:95%,end
But we need to move on.

00:04:25.898 --> 00:04:29.102 line:95%,end
KELLY: Abby has been in the dance world
long enough to know

00:04:29.168 --> 00:04:31.671 line:95%,end
<i>that when that happens, you win.</i>

00:04:31.738 --> 00:04:33.940 line:95%,end
<i>So the second Maddie's music stopped,</i>

00:04:34.007 --> 00:04:35.475 line:95%,end
I knew what was going on.

00:04:35.541 --> 00:04:39.479 line:95%,end
ABBY: Now, this week we will be attending
Energy Dance Competition again.

00:04:40.046 --> 00:04:42.582 line:95%,end
It's in Waterford Township, Michigan.

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:47.620 line:95%,end
Last week when I called to enter
the routines, Gina, the owner--

00:04:47.687 --> 00:04:51.624 line:95%,end
she told me there are two
studios specifically coming

00:04:51.691 --> 00:04:54.327 line:95%,end
to beat the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:04:54.394 --> 00:04:57.196 line:95%,end
The director of the competition
was kind enough to tell me

00:04:57.263 --> 00:04:59.766 line:95%,end
that two studios called to register,

00:04:59.832 --> 00:05:02.001 line:95%,end
<i>determined to take down the ALDC.</i>

00:05:02.535 --> 00:05:04.504 line:95%,end
<i>I'm going to have to</i>
<i>pull out all the stops.</i>

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.873 line:95%,end
Let's talk about the group number.

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:09.175 line:95%,end
It's called "Silver Spoon,"

00:05:09.676 --> 00:05:13.446 line:95%,end
silver meaning the finest
quality flatware,

00:05:13.513 --> 00:05:16.382 line:95%,end
meaning the luxuries of life,

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:20.219 line:95%,end
the country club, the finest schools.

00:05:20.286 --> 00:05:21.754 line:95%,end
So this is a pretty dance.

00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:23.289 line:95%,end
We also have a prop.

00:05:24.123 --> 00:05:25.992 line:95%,end
We have a big giant spoon,

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:29.562 line:95%,end
and you pass the spoon around
throughout the routine.

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:31.831 line:95%,end
I want to talk about the rest
of the numbers for this week.

00:05:31.898 --> 00:05:34.434 line:95%,end
Maddie, you and Chloe
will be doing a duet.

00:05:34.934 --> 00:05:37.236 line:95%,end
It's called "Inside of Me."

00:05:38.237 --> 00:05:40.306 line:95%,end
And you need to work together.

00:05:40.373 --> 00:05:41.574 line:95%,end
You need to be a team.

00:05:41.641 --> 00:05:43.576 line:95%,end
I want to see that teamwork, once again.

00:05:43.643 --> 00:05:44.544 line:95%,end
Understood?

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.846 line:5%,start
MADDIE: Chloe and I make
a great team for our duet

00:05:46.913 --> 00:05:50.316 line:5%,start
because we're always in sync
and we're really good friends.

00:05:50.383 --> 00:05:52.352 line:95%,end
<i>So I think it helps out with that.</i>

00:05:52.418 --> 00:05:54.721 line:95%,end
Nia, you're going
to have a solo this week.

00:05:54.787 --> 00:05:57.123 line:95%,end
It is called "Bound."

00:05:58.558 --> 00:06:02.028 line:95%,end
It means you're being held back

00:06:02.095 --> 00:06:03.796 line:95%,end
while you're trying to chase your dream.

00:06:05.665 --> 00:06:07.900 line:95%,end
Mackenzie, you're doing a solo.

00:06:07.967 --> 00:06:10.670 line:95%,end
Your dance is called "Daisy Chain."

00:06:10.737 --> 00:06:12.772 line:95%,end
You're like a flower,
and you're thinking,

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:14.374 line:95%,end
"He loves me, he loves me not.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.042 line:95%,end
He loves me, he loves me not."

00:06:16.109 --> 00:06:18.611 line:95%,end
And it's not Justin Bieber,
it's the judges.

00:06:18.678 --> 00:06:19.679 line:95%,end
Understood?

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.682 line:95%,end
MACKENZIE: <i>I wish Justin Bieber</i>
<i>was one of the judges.</i>

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:23.716 line:5%,start
He's cute.

00:06:23.783 --> 00:06:25.385 line:5%,start
(laughs)

00:06:25.451 --> 00:06:28.588 line:95%,end
ABBY: Maddie, you will be doing
"Helen Keller."

00:06:28.654 --> 00:06:32.592 line:95%,end
You will be deaf, you will be blind,
and you will be mute.

00:06:32.658 --> 00:06:35.828 line:95%,end
I am using an old routine
that was undefeated,

00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:37.630 line:95%,end
that was absolutely beautiful.

00:06:37.697 --> 00:06:40.366 line:95%,end
<i>And it's about the actual</i>
<i>character of Helen Keller.</i>

00:06:40.433 --> 00:06:42.468 line:95%,end
<i>I'm really putting a lot</i>
<i>of pressure on Maddie.</i>

00:06:42.535 --> 00:06:44.804 line:95%,end
I need those judges
to be right on top of her,

00:06:44.871 --> 00:06:47.240 line:95%,end
so they get the story
and it touches a nerve.

00:06:47.306 --> 00:06:49.809 line:95%,end
So you need to be in character

00:06:49.876 --> 00:06:52.445 line:95%,end
and you need a rag doll
to bring to rehearsal.

00:06:52.512 --> 00:06:54.881 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>I'm surprised that Maddie</i>
<i>is at the top of the pyramid.</i>

00:06:55.782 --> 00:06:58.084 line:95%,end
Maddie wasn't even supposed
to have a solo last week.

00:06:58.151 --> 00:06:59.952 line:95%,end
<i>And, as far as I'm concerned,</i>
<i>that shouldn't even</i>

00:07:00.019 --> 00:07:03.089 line:95%,end
<i>have been considered as part</i>
<i>of the placement on the pyramid.</i>

00:07:03.156 --> 00:07:05.091 line:95%,end
Like, that's the unfair treatment.

00:07:05.158 --> 00:07:06.893 line:95%,end
ABBY: All right, moms, you can go.

00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:08.861 line:95%,end
All right. Spread apart
we're going to do a warm up.

00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:10.696 line:95%,end
I'd like your legs right out
in front of you.

00:07:10.763 --> 00:07:13.566 line:95%,end
While the girls are stretching
and getting ready for rehearsal,

00:07:13.633 --> 00:07:15.168 line:95%,end
<i>I need to have a little chat with Kelly.</i>

00:07:15.234 --> 00:07:17.937 line:95%,end
I need to remind her that I'm the boss.

00:07:18.004 --> 00:07:21.474 line:95%,end
I wanted to talk to you about a few things
that happened last week.

00:07:23.209 --> 00:07:24.076 line:95%,end
Done!

00:07:24.143 --> 00:07:25.144 line:95%,end
(gasps)

00:07:26.546 --> 00:07:27.780 line:95%,end
KELLY: (bleep) you, Abby.


00:07:27.847 --> 00:07:29.115 line:95%,end
ABBY: You don't need it
for the competition.

00:07:29.182 --> 00:07:30.883 line:95%,end
I told you to do it today.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:31.984 line:95%,end
(bleep) you.

00:07:32.351 --> 00:07:36.389 line:95%,end
ABBY: I can't have the loss
of self-control or the language go on

00:07:36.456 --> 00:07:38.524 line:95%,end
when there's other customers
in the studio. Yes.

00:07:38.591 --> 00:07:41.127 line:95%,end
You threw a chair and scared
my ten-year-old.

00:07:41.194 --> 00:07:42.728 line:95%,end
-Well--
-It goes both ways.

00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:46.432 line:95%,end
Yes, but this contract
doesn't go both ways.

00:07:46.499 --> 00:07:49.101 line:95%,end
I want to take her contract
that she signed

00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:51.070 line:95%,end
and make her read it.

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:52.572 line:95%,end
I don't think the woman reads.

00:07:53.506 --> 00:07:57.944 line:95%,end
Foul language or unsportsmanlike
behavior by a dancer or parent

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:01.113 line:95%,end
will risk expulsion from
the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:08:01.614 --> 00:08:05.017 line:95%,end
I don't care how much time and energy
I've invested in her children,

00:08:05.084 --> 00:08:07.386 line:95%,end
<i>if she opens that filthy mouth</i>
<i>one more time,</i>

00:08:07.453 --> 00:08:09.188 line:95%,end
those kids are going to be shown the door.

00:08:09.255 --> 00:08:10.890 line:95%,end
Yeah. How'd that go?

00:08:10.957 --> 00:08:13.226 line:95%,end
Well, she put out the contract
and was like--

00:08:13.292 --> 00:08:15.061 line:95%,end
Oh, you mean at the top
of the contract that says,

00:08:15.127 --> 00:08:17.430 line:95%,end
"We will provide a nurturing and safe..."

00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:18.965 line:95%,end
-KELLY: Yeah, yeah.
-"...positive learning experience?"

00:08:19.031 --> 00:08:21.501 line:95%,end
KELLY: I will stay here
just to torture her.

00:08:21.567 --> 00:08:23.236 line:95%,end
HOLLY: (laughs)

00:08:23.302 --> 00:08:25.404 line:95%,end
ABBY: All right, ladies,
we have three days--

00:08:25.471 --> 00:08:27.507 line:95%,end
three days to put
an entire routine together

00:08:27.573 --> 00:08:30.276 line:95%,end
that is completely different
than anything you've ever done.

00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:33.012 line:95%,end
The group number this week
is called "Silver Spoons,"

00:08:33.079 --> 00:08:37.216 line:95%,end
<i>kind of a play on you were born</i>
<i>with a silver spoon in your mouth.</i>

00:08:37.283 --> 00:08:40.753 line:95%,end
I want them to look like they were born
and raised at the country club.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.256 line:95%,end
<i>I think we have a good shot</i>
<i>at a winning number.</i>

00:08:45.758 --> 00:08:46.759 line:95%,end
Come on, girls!

00:08:46.826 --> 00:08:49.295 line:95%,end
We are not going to lose
to those two other teams.

00:08:50.062 --> 00:08:51.197 line:95%,end
HOLLY: You know what's interesting?

00:08:51.264 --> 00:08:55.701 line:95%,end
Last week, Chloe went
to the physical therapist and the doctor.

00:08:55.768 --> 00:08:56.602 line:95%,end
Mm-hmm.

00:08:56.669 --> 00:08:58.738 line:95%,end
HOLLY: So how come
there was an issue this week?

00:09:00.506 --> 00:09:02.675 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Somebody told her
that she went to the movie.

00:09:02.742 --> 00:09:04.410 line:95%,end
Chloe didn't show up for class last week.

00:09:04.477 --> 00:09:05.645 line:95%,end
<i>She was at the movies.</i>

00:09:05.711 --> 00:09:07.780 line:95%,end
Who rats out a ten-year-old?

00:09:07.847 --> 00:09:09.081 line:95%,end
I didn't tell her.

00:09:10.249 --> 00:09:13.152 line:5%,start
MELISSA: Typically, I never tell Abby
things that the people do

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:14.453 line:5%,start
behind her back.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.256 line:5%,start
But I was just so sick
of all the moms saying that

00:09:17.323 --> 00:09:21.594 line:95%,end
I don't follow the rules,
so I let her know that Christi

00:09:21.661 --> 00:09:24.564 line:95%,end
had no intention of bringing
her child to class on Monday.

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:25.865 line:95%,end
So who told her?

00:09:25.932 --> 00:09:26.866 line:95%,end
I told her that.

00:09:26.933 --> 00:09:28.100 line:95%,end
(tense music playing)

00:09:28.167 --> 00:09:31.137 line:95%,end
If Melissa really had a problem
with Chloe going to the movies,

00:09:31.203 --> 00:09:33.039 line:95%,end
I don't know, I would think
that she would come to me

00:09:33.105 --> 00:09:36.309 line:95%,end
and ask me about it instead of going
to tattle to the dance teacher.

00:09:36.375 --> 00:09:39.378 line:95%,end
So why is it your business to tell her
that she went to the movie?

00:09:39.445 --> 00:09:41.814 line:95%,end
She wasn't allowed to dance,
so what do you care where she is?

00:09:41.881 --> 00:09:45.685 line:95%,end
I just told Abby because
I was just pissed off because--

00:09:45.751 --> 00:09:47.520 line:95%,end
Do you need to make sure that
you get on Abby's good side?

00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:49.388 line:95%,end
-I'm not on Abby's good side.
-CHRISTI: Yeah, you are, Melissa.

00:09:50.289 --> 00:09:52.158 line:95%,end
She claims that she and Abby
are no longer friends.

00:09:52.224 --> 00:09:55.328 line:95%,end
But, man, you're really working hard
to get back on her good side, aren't you?

00:09:55.394 --> 00:09:57.096 line:95%,end
Do we need to talk
about all the other lies?

00:09:58.397 --> 00:10:02.034 line:95%,end
We were told, by you
on the phone to Kelly,

00:10:02.201 --> 00:10:03.736 line:95%,end
that Maddie practiced with her music

00:10:03.803 --> 00:10:05.538 line:95%,end
like that she knew to keep dancing.

00:10:05.705 --> 00:10:07.473 line:95%,end
KELLY:
The day after Maddie's music skipped,

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:08.941 line:95%,end
I talked to Melissa on the phone.

00:10:09.008 --> 00:10:11.911 line:95%,end
And she admitted to me that
if Maddie's music skipped,

00:10:11.978 --> 00:10:13.913 line:95%,end
she was instructed to keep on dancing.

00:10:14.313 --> 00:10:16.115 line:95%,end
So make my daughter look bad again.

00:10:16.182 --> 00:10:18.884 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: No. We're telling you
that you look bad.

00:10:18.951 --> 00:10:20.786 line:95%,end
-MELISSA: Okay.
-Because you have said

00:10:20.853 --> 00:10:23.522 line:95%,end
that it's okay to lie and cheat

00:10:23.589 --> 00:10:25.725 line:95%,end
as long as you win and you get your way.

00:10:25.791 --> 00:10:26.626 line:95%,end
And, you know what?

00:10:26.692 --> 00:10:29.295 line:95%,end
That's not something that any
of us want to teach our kids.

00:10:30.696 --> 00:10:33.833 line:95%,end
My daughter did not practice
to music like that.

00:10:33.899 --> 00:10:36.602 line:95%,end
KELLY: Melissa, I really have
a hard time believing you.

00:10:36.669 --> 00:10:37.737 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Well, someone here is lying.

00:10:37.803 --> 00:10:39.872 line:95%,end
And if Abby set that up,
that would be pretty despicable.

00:10:39.939 --> 00:10:41.474 line:95%,end
-That's cheating.
-KELLY: But how can you do that?

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:42.541 line:95%,end
-It's cheating.
-I don't know.

00:10:42.608 --> 00:10:43.676 line:95%,end
-I would have no idea.
-MELISSA: How can you--

00:10:43.743 --> 00:10:45.077 line:95%,end
-You cheated.
-But that would be pretty low.

00:10:45.144 --> 00:10:46.579 line:95%,end
I didn't do anything of the sort.

00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:47.880 line:95%,end
I would never cheat.

00:10:47.947 --> 00:10:52.418 line:95%,end
The moms accused Abby
of causing my daughter's music to skip.

00:10:52.985 --> 00:10:54.186 line:95%,end
<i>That's, like, sabotage.</i>

00:10:54.253 --> 00:10:55.955 line:95%,end
ABBY: Go back.
Let's try it one time.

00:10:56.022 --> 00:10:58.357 line:95%,end
I need to speak to Abby
about the situation,

00:10:58.424 --> 00:11:00.059 line:95%,end
<i>and I need to get to the bottom of it.</i>

00:11:00.126 --> 00:11:01.360 line:95%,end
You'd have to ask her.

00:11:01.427 --> 00:11:03.229 line:95%,end
Oh, I will. I guarantee it.

00:11:03.295 --> 00:11:05.631 line:95%,end
I'm not happy about this.


00:11:09.368 --> 00:11:12.371 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:11:16.909 --> 00:11:19.912 line:5%,start
(dramatic music playing)

00:11:22.014 --> 00:11:23.115 line:5%,start
Left shoulder.

00:11:23.582 --> 00:11:25.885 line:5%,start
Maddie and I have a duet this week
called "Inside of Me,"

00:11:25.951 --> 00:11:26.919 line:5%,start
and I really like it.

00:11:26.986 --> 00:11:29.121 line:95%,end
<i>And we only have three days to learn it,</i>

00:11:29.188 --> 00:11:32.024 line:95%,end
clean it, and perfect it
for the competition.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:35.428 line:95%,end
Okay, come on.

00:11:35.494 --> 00:11:37.596 line:5%,start
Maddie and Chloe have several challenges

00:11:37.663 --> 00:11:39.765 line:5%,start
in the routine "Inside of Me."

00:11:39.832 --> 00:11:40.900 line:95%,end
<i>There's partner work.</i>

00:11:40.966 --> 00:11:42.034 line:95%,end
<i>They have to work together.</i>

00:11:42.101 --> 00:11:43.302 line:95%,end
<i>They have to trust each other.</i>

00:11:43.369 --> 00:11:45.805 line:95%,end
<i>They have to be technically correct.</i>

00:11:45.871 --> 00:11:48.140 line:95%,end
All of those things go into this duet.

00:11:48.207 --> 00:11:49.775 line:95%,end
I want to see that partner work.

00:11:49.842 --> 00:11:51.310 line:95%,end
I want to see that together stuff.

00:11:51.377 --> 00:11:52.812 line:95%,end
I want to see the timing.

00:11:52.878 --> 00:11:54.280 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Abby,
I really need to talk to you.

00:11:54.346 --> 00:11:55.281 line:95%,end
It's really, really important.

00:11:55.347 --> 00:11:56.415 line:95%,end
The kids need to leave.

00:11:56.949 --> 00:11:57.983 line:95%,end
-I really need to talk--
-ABBY: I need to--

00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:59.318 line:95%,end
I am so pissed. Abby, I don't care.

00:11:59.385 --> 00:12:00.820 line:95%,end
I need to talk to you, please.

00:12:00.886 --> 00:12:02.855 line:95%,end
Girls, go real quick, very quickly.

00:12:02.922 --> 00:12:03.756 line:95%,end
Go.

00:12:03.823 --> 00:12:05.224 line:5%,start
I walk into the studio,

00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:07.126 line:5%,start
and Maddie and Chloe are practicing.

00:12:07.193 --> 00:12:10.196 line:5%,start
Maddie is mad at me
that I walk into the studio.

00:12:10.262 --> 00:12:11.363 line:95%,end
And I really don't care.

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:12.765 line:95%,end
I need to get to the bottom of this.

00:12:12.832 --> 00:12:14.500 line:95%,end
Melissa's in there talking to Abby.

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:15.568 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Oh, great.

00:12:15.634 --> 00:12:16.736 line:95%,end
Go and tattle on us.

00:12:16.802 --> 00:12:19.171 line:95%,end
What do you think we're--
what do you think she's saying?

00:12:19.238 --> 00:12:20.573 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Maybe she's not talking about it.

00:12:20.639 --> 00:12:21.941 line:95%,end
-Sure.
-KELLY: Oh, God.

00:12:22.007 --> 00:12:23.676 line:95%,end
After we just finished saying don't talk--

00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:25.711 line:95%,end
And she's going to say
they're just jealous.

00:12:25.778 --> 00:12:29.081 line:5%,start
Melissa, once again, storms off
to go tattle on us to Abby.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.818 line:95%,end
that she didn't do
what Kelly was saying she did,

00:12:32.885 --> 00:12:34.487 line:95%,end
then stay and defend yourself.

00:12:34.553 --> 00:12:36.422 line:95%,end
Don't go run and tattle on us to Abby.

00:12:36.489 --> 00:12:39.358 line:95%,end
These mothers are calling my daughter
a cheater for last weekend.

00:12:39.425 --> 00:12:43.162 line:95%,end
They said that she practiced
her dance with that music.

00:12:43.229 --> 00:12:44.630 line:95%,end
Did you cheat for my daughter?

-They're calling me--
-Absolutely not.

00:12:46.065 --> 00:12:47.833 line:95%,end
You would never send a child

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:51.437 line:95%,end
intentionally onstage with a bad CD.

00:12:51.871 --> 00:12:53.339 line:95%,end
That makes me look bad.

00:12:53.672 --> 00:12:56.275 line:95%,end
I've been doing this for 32 years, women.

00:12:56.342 --> 00:12:57.276 line:95%,end
Wake up!

00:12:57.343 --> 00:12:59.078 line:95%,end
-That could ruin...
-I have some stickers all over my--

00:12:59.145 --> 00:13:00.479 line:95%,end
MELISSA: ...my daughter's career.

00:13:00.546 --> 00:13:01.447 line:95%,end
-I would never...
-ABBY: Whoa!

00:13:01.514 --> 00:13:02.848 line:95%,end
-MELISSA: ...let my daughter dance.
-Wait a second!

00:13:02.915 --> 00:13:04.016 line:95%,end
Your daughter's career?

00:13:04.083 --> 00:13:05.184 line:95%,end
-How about my name?
-MELISSA: I know.

00:13:05.251 --> 00:13:07.353 line:95%,end
-How about my reputation?
-I know it's your reputation.

00:13:07.419 --> 00:13:09.288 line:95%,end
-But my daughter's nine.

MELISSA: I'm sorry, because
they're calling my daughter a cheater.

00:13:13.359 --> 00:13:15.161 line:95%,end
I don't want my daughter
to be labeled as a cheater.

00:13:15.227 --> 00:13:16.228 line:95%,end
ABBY: She's not.

00:13:16.295 --> 00:13:19.131 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I don't want you
to keep her special treatment or--

00:13:19.198 --> 00:13:20.499 line:95%,end
I'm pissed. I'm done.

00:13:20.566 --> 00:13:23.969 line:95%,end
ABBY: Melissa, she's once again
jealous that your kid won.

00:13:24.036 --> 00:13:25.237 line:95%,end
Don't you get it?

00:13:25.304 --> 00:13:27.907 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Well, okay.
Well, I'm--I'm not happy.

00:13:27.973 --> 00:13:29.074 line:95%,end
ABBY: Toughen up, Melissa.

00:13:29.141 --> 00:13:30.843 line:95%,end
MELISSA: <i>I was mad. I was mad at Abby,</i>

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:32.845 line:95%,end
but I wanted to make sure
that she wouldn't do this.

00:13:32.912 --> 00:13:35.414 line:95%,end
And she said, "I would never do that,
ever, ever, ever."

00:13:35.481 --> 00:13:36.782 line:95%,end
And I believe her.

00:13:36.849 --> 00:13:38.617 line:95%,end
What were you talking to Abby about?

00:13:38.684 --> 00:13:41.654 line:95%,end
I asked her if she did something
to the CD.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.223 line:95%,end
She's pissed that I even thought
that she would do that.

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:52.698 line:95%,end
All right, girls, listen!

00:13:53.432 --> 00:13:54.700 line:95%,end
We have two days--

00:13:54.767 --> 00:13:58.437 line:95%,end
two days to get this number finished
and clean, and it's a mess.

00:13:58.504 --> 00:14:01.040 line:95%,end
<i>We have two days until the competition,</i>

00:14:01.106 --> 00:14:02.775 line:95%,end

00:14:02.842 --> 00:14:05.611 line:95%,end
<i>We have two teams</i>
<i>gunning for us this week,</i>

00:14:05.678 --> 00:14:08.147 line:95%,end
and my group number is not looking good.

00:14:08.214 --> 00:14:10.382 line:95%,end
I need to fix it and fix it fast.

00:14:10.449 --> 00:14:13.452 line:5%,start
(playful music playing)

00:14:16.055 --> 00:14:18.023 line:5%,start
I'm really nervous
for the "Silver Spoon" dance

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:20.593 line:5%,start
because I don't want to drop the spoon.

00:14:21.961 --> 00:14:23.195 line:95%,end
ABBY: Okay. Just set it down.

00:14:23.262 --> 00:14:24.964 line:95%,end
Does anyone have to turn with that spoon?

00:14:25.898 --> 00:14:27.666 line:95%,end
Why can't we just use a little spoon?

00:14:27.733 --> 00:14:31.604 line:5%,start
It is one big spoon.

00:14:32.905 --> 00:14:34.440 line:95%,end
Whoa!

00:14:34.506 --> 00:14:36.141 line:95%,end
<i>The prop is fabulous.</i>

00:14:36.208 --> 00:14:38.744 line:95%,end
I mean, it looks great for pictures.

00:14:38.811 --> 00:14:40.846 line:95%,end
<i>But the girls could not dance with it.</i>

00:14:40.913 --> 00:14:42.314 line:95%,end
They can't even get off the floor.

00:14:42.381 --> 00:14:43.983 line:95%,end
I'm trying to find something

00:14:44.416 --> 00:14:47.519 line:95%,end
that's not so heavy for them to work with.

00:14:47.586 --> 00:14:50.789 line:5%,start
It's very difficult to rehearse
with that big, giant spoon.

00:14:50.856 --> 00:14:52.591 line:95%,end
<i>All of us are having really hard times</i>

00:14:52.658 --> 00:14:54.793 line:95%,end
because we can't really lift it.

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:56.028 line:95%,end
It's bigger than us.

00:14:56.095 --> 00:14:58.264 line:95%,end
Can we try it with this trophy

00:14:58.330 --> 00:14:59.765 line:95%,end
and see if it's easier for them?

00:14:59.832 --> 00:15:01.433 line:95%,end
Okay, Maddie, let's go.


00:15:02.735 --> 00:15:05.738 line:95%,end
(whimsical music playing)

00:15:09.909 --> 00:15:11.377 line:95%,end
ABBY: All right. That's a wrap.

00:15:11.443 --> 00:15:12.912 line:95%,end
Nia, solo, you're up.

00:15:12.978 --> 00:15:14.680 line:5%,start
HOLLY: <i>Now I'm watching Nia's solo</i>

00:15:14.747 --> 00:15:18.484 line:5%,start
and I'm already noticing
it is so different than any solo

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:20.619 line:95%,end
she has ever done before in her life.

00:15:20.686 --> 00:15:24.023 line:95%,end
<i>It has a more mature tone to it.</i>

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:27.359 line:95%,end
It could be a defining
moment for Nia, as a dancer.

00:15:28.994 --> 00:15:30.629 line:5%,start
Stretch that bottom foot.

00:15:33.232 --> 00:15:36.835 line:95%,end
This is his first solo
since the whole Miami debacle.

00:15:40.439 --> 00:15:43.575 line:95%,end
(applause)

00:15:43.642 --> 00:15:46.912 line:95%,end
She needs to prove to me
that she is a competitor.

00:15:46.979 --> 00:15:50.416 line:95%,end
She needs to warrant
more difficult choreography.

00:15:51.517 --> 00:15:52.851 line:95%,end
Face.

00:15:52.918 --> 00:15:53.752 line:95%,end
You're dying.

00:15:53.819 --> 00:15:57.523 line:95%,end
If I was judging, I would say
losing momentum, losing energy.

00:15:57.589 --> 00:15:59.525 line:95%,end
Come on, stamina.

00:16:00.059 --> 00:16:02.027 line:95%,end
Stamina. Keep it up. Face.

00:16:06.565 --> 00:16:09.535 line:95%,end
(applause)

00:16:09.601 --> 00:16:11.737 line:95%,end
I think Nia looks really great
doing this number.

00:16:11.804 --> 00:16:12.938 line:95%,end
I think it's good for her.

00:16:13.005 --> 00:16:14.006 line:95%,end
It shows strength.

00:16:14.073 --> 00:16:15.808 line:95%,end
<i>She has some good jumps at it.</i>

00:16:15.874 --> 00:16:17.476 line:95%,end
I think it's a really nice number for her.

00:16:17.543 --> 00:16:19.378 line:95%,end
Maddie, when you get a drink,

00:16:19.445 --> 00:16:21.213 line:95%,end
get your ragdoll and get it back in here.

00:16:21.747 --> 00:16:23.315 line:95%,end
Oh, we have a doll!

00:16:23.382 --> 00:16:24.817 line:95%,end
Someone did their homework.

00:16:25.351 --> 00:16:28.020 line:95%,end
Okay, well, this is cute.

00:16:28.087 --> 00:16:30.189 line:95%,end
But this is, like, a boy doll.

00:16:30.255 --> 00:16:32.057 line:95%,end
So this is perfect.

00:16:32.124 --> 00:16:35.661 line:95%,end
<i>During the Helen Keller number,</i>
<i>Maddie dances with the doll.</i>

00:16:35.728 --> 00:16:37.896 line:95%,end
This is more than just a prop.

00:16:37.963 --> 00:16:40.199 line:95%,end
It's a very important part of the piece.

00:16:41.533 --> 00:16:44.536 line:5%,start
(piano music playing)

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:47.773 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>For this routine to be a success,</i>

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:51.310 line:95%,end
<i>Maddie needs to know</i>
<i>where the doll is at all times.</i>

00:16:51.377 --> 00:16:52.878 line:95%,end
<i>She's supposed to be blind.</i>

00:16:52.945 --> 00:16:55.647 line:95%,end
If she breaks character,
the judges are going to know it.

00:16:57.116 --> 00:16:58.717 line:95%,end
No. I want to put the aerial in.

00:16:58.784 --> 00:17:00.052 line:95%,end
I forgot you did it at the end.

00:17:00.119 --> 00:17:01.954 line:95%,end
I want you to aerial over the doll.

00:17:05.324 --> 00:17:07.593 line:95%,end
I'm not really nervous
for my "Helen Keller" solo.

00:17:07.659 --> 00:17:09.361 line:95%,end
<i>I think this is a good dance for me</i>

00:17:09.428 --> 00:17:13.265 line:95%,end

<i>at Nexstar in Upland, California.</i>

00:17:24.643 --> 00:17:27.679 line:95%,end
She left the stage, and I don't want
the same thing to happen again.

00:17:27.746 --> 00:17:29.782 line:95%,end
<i>Stay out there</i>
<i>and do what you were taught.</i>

00:17:29.848 --> 00:17:31.817 line:95%,end
<i>So that's our lesson</i>
<i>with her for this week.</i>

00:17:31.884 --> 00:17:35.921 line:95%,end
Cross your fingers,
or that kid's going to be mincemeat.

00:17:39.691 --> 00:17:40.626 line:95%,end
Do you know what to do next?

00:17:42.628 --> 00:17:44.563 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Mackenzie can't do this solo.
She's not ready.

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:45.831 line:95%,end
She doesn't remember it.

00:17:45.898 --> 00:17:47.066 line:95%,end
She can't do solos.

00:17:47.132 --> 00:17:49.001 line:95%,end
It makes me so nervous for the competition

00:17:49.068 --> 00:17:52.438 line:95%,end
because Mackenzie needs
at least two weeks to learn a dance,

00:17:52.504 --> 00:17:53.705 line:95%,end
not two days.

MELISSA: <i>I'm going to lunch today</i>

00:17:59.645 --> 00:18:02.681 line:95%,end
and I just want to talk
to her about this music issue,

00:18:02.748 --> 00:18:03.916 line:95%,end
and get it out in the open.

00:18:03.982 --> 00:18:06.985 line:95%,end
I feel like I can talk to Holly
without her screaming at me.

00:18:07.052 --> 00:18:09.455 line:95%,end
My daughter or I did not do
anything wrong, Holly.

00:18:09.521 --> 00:18:12.624 line:95%,end
HOLLY: I--I'm just trying
to figure out What is going on.

00:18:12.691 --> 00:18:14.927 line:95%,end
Because that exploded quickly.

00:18:14.993 --> 00:18:17.663 line:95%,end
It escalated really, really fast.

00:18:17.729 --> 00:18:21.366 line:95%,end
The fight we had upstairs
about the scratched CD

00:18:21.433 --> 00:18:23.302 line:95%,end
in Maddie's solo was driving me insane.

00:18:23.368 --> 00:18:28.073 line:95%,end
It was like World War III
erupted over this scratched CD.

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:29.842 line:95%,end
In this dance world,
there's so much coming out

00:18:29.908 --> 00:18:31.276 line:95%,end
-with different directions.
-Mm-hmm.

00:18:31.343 --> 00:18:33.378 line:95%,end
And you feel like
you don't know what's going on.

00:18:33.445 --> 00:18:35.781 line:95%,end
I only have the dance moms to rely on.

00:18:35.848 --> 00:18:38.350 line:95%,end
That's why it's really important for me

00:18:38.417 --> 00:18:40.819 line:95%,end
to be able to trust you
and trust the other moms, too.

00:18:40.886 --> 00:18:42.721 line:95%,end
-We have to be able to trust each other.
-Mm-hmm.

00:18:42.788 --> 00:18:45.891 line:95%,end
Something's going on
and we have to resolve it.

00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:47.860 line:95%,end
We're calling each other liars and cheats,

00:18:47.926 --> 00:18:50.395 line:95%,end
and that's not a team.

All right.

I have a new spoon.
Let's try it with this.

00:18:58.737 --> 00:19:01.240 line:95%,end
This is the last day
we have to rehearse, ladies.

00:19:01.306 --> 00:19:02.174 line:95%,end
So, come on.

<i>This is our last chance to rehearse.</i>

00:19:06.111 --> 00:19:08.380 line:5%,start
I've already had to replace
our silver spoon prop,

We need to utilize this time. Let's go.

Let's go. Let's go.

00:19:14.553 --> 00:19:15.821 line:95%,end
<i>We have a lot to do today.</i>

00:19:15.888 --> 00:19:19.958 line:95%,end
We have three solos, a duet,

00:19:20.025 --> 00:19:21.393 line:95%,end
plus costume fittings.

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:22.728 line:95%,end
<i>There is no time to waste.</i>

00:19:22.794 --> 00:19:23.962 line:95%,end
Let's do it.

Smile!

Smile when I yell at you!

Don't sickle your left foot

Turn your feet out!

I'm watching the dance.

You can't even tell what it is.

00:20:12.344 --> 00:20:14.112 line:95%,end
I don't know
what it's going to look like on stage.

00:20:14.179 --> 00:20:15.714 line:95%,end
It's sort of just looks like a wand.

00:20:15.781 --> 00:20:18.317 line:95%,end
ABBY: Let's grab a drink,
and then we'll go into the other numbers.

00:20:18.383 --> 00:20:20.719 line:95%,end
One of my favorite things
is seeing the girls

00:20:20.786 --> 00:20:22.754 line:95%,end
<i>try their costumes on</i>
<i>for the very first time.</i>

00:20:22.821 --> 00:20:25.924 line:95%,end
Costumes can really make
or break a performance.

00:20:25.991 --> 00:20:28.060 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I like Nia's costume.
I think it's cool.

00:20:28.126 --> 00:20:30.796 line:95%,end
That looks like the first,
like, mature costume she's had.

00:20:30.862 --> 00:20:32.297 line:95%,end
It's not, like, a cutesy costume.

00:20:32.364 --> 00:20:35.534 line:5%,start
When I first heard Nia's costume,
I was so happy.

00:20:35.601 --> 00:20:37.836 line:95%,end
<i>It's not a cutesy kind of costume.</i>

00:20:37.903 --> 00:20:39.304 line:95%,end
<i>It has a bunch of ropes.</i>

00:20:39.371 --> 00:20:41.573 line:95%,end
I really think that Nia's stepping up this
week

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.875 line:95%,end
with her costume and performance.

00:20:45.911 --> 00:20:47.346 line:95%,end
ABBY: Great. Get your butt down there.

00:20:47.412 --> 00:20:48.847 line:95%,end
All right, Nia, it's good.

00:20:48.914 --> 00:20:50.582 line:95%,end
I'm still not seeing a lot of face.

00:20:50.649 --> 00:20:51.750 line:95%,end
Sometimes you're amazing.

00:20:51.817 --> 00:20:53.719 line:95%,end
Other times you're sloppy, sloppy, sloppy.

00:20:53.785 --> 00:20:55.754 line:95%,end
All right, let's go, daisy head.

00:20:55.821 --> 00:20:57.623 line:95%,end
HOLLY: I think Mackenzie's
costume's adorable.

00:20:57.689 --> 00:20:58.523 line:95%,end
Mm-hmm. It's cute.

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:00.392 line:95%,end
Just keep dancing.

00:21:00.459 --> 00:21:02.027 line:95%,end
It doesn't matter what--
nobody knows the dance.

00:21:02.094 --> 00:21:04.696 line:95%,end
Mackenzie is so cute
in her "Daisy Chains" costumes.

00:21:04.763 --> 00:21:06.765 line:95%,end
But if she doesn't remember her solo,

00:21:06.832 --> 00:21:08.700 line:95%,end
cute can only take you so far.

00:21:08.767 --> 00:21:13.372 line:95%,end
ABBY: And stand up and off.

00:21:13.438 --> 00:21:14.439 line:95%,end
You did it.

00:21:16.074 --> 00:21:17.743 line:95%,end
Is that all we have?

00:21:17.809 --> 00:21:20.946 line:95%,end
<i>The girls come in</i>
<i>in their "Silver Spoon" costumes,</i>

00:21:21.013 --> 00:21:22.381 line:95%,end
and something's just not right.

00:21:22.447 --> 00:21:25.417 line:95%,end
I have two pink, two blue, and one green.


00:21:25.484 --> 00:21:27.152 line:95%,end
Go to your formation. Let's see.

00:21:30.255 --> 00:21:31.857 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>There's five girls in the dance.</i>

00:21:31.923 --> 00:21:34.993 line:95%,end
There's two pink costumes,
two blue costumes, and one green.

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:36.995 line:95%,end
So, obviously, the girl wearing the green

00:21:37.062 --> 00:21:38.997 line:95%,end
is going to stand out, and that was Paige.

00:21:39.064 --> 00:21:41.166 line:95%,end
And, apparently, that couldn't happen.

00:21:41.233 --> 00:21:45.170 line:95%,end
Paige, put the pink
on that your sister has on.

00:21:45.237 --> 00:21:48.807 line:95%,end
-HOLLY: The pink is too big.
-CHRISTI: Oh, the pink is too big.

00:21:48.874 --> 00:21:50.575 line:95%,end
-Way big. That's, like, a large.
-CHRISTI: It's too big.

00:21:50.642 --> 00:21:51.476 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Yeah.

00:21:51.543 --> 00:21:53.412 line:95%,end
The green one's the right size for her.

00:21:53.478 --> 00:21:54.379 line:95%,end
KELLY: But it's Paige.

00:21:54.446 --> 00:21:55.647 line:95%,end
She doesn't matter.

00:21:55.714 --> 00:21:58.150 line:95%,end
ABBY: Paige, turn around.
Let me see that on you.

00:21:58.216 --> 00:21:59.651 line:95%,end
What size is yours?

00:22:00.152 --> 00:22:01.653 line:95%,end
I'm not fixing that costume.

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.055 line:95%,end
ABBY: Chloe and Brooke, switch.

00:22:03.121 --> 00:22:05.190 line:95%,end
So the obvious choice was to take Chloe,

00:22:05.257 --> 00:22:07.726 line:95%,end
who starts the routine
stage left all by herself,

00:22:07.793 --> 00:22:10.162 line:95%,end
<i>and put her in the different color.</i>

00:22:10.228 --> 00:22:11.930 line:95%,end
She has to wear the green dress.

00:22:11.997 --> 00:22:13.799 line:95%,end
The green doesn't fit Chloe, either.

00:22:13.865 --> 00:22:14.933 line:95%,end
-It's too small.
-Yeah.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.336 line:95%,end
KELLY: No. But she'll have
one wear a costume too big

00:22:17.402 --> 00:22:19.137 line:95%,end
and one wear a costume too small

00:22:19.204 --> 00:22:22.107 line:95%,end
just so my daughter doesn't stick out.

00:22:22.607 --> 00:22:23.775 line:95%,end
MELISSA: <i>I don't know</i>
<i>what these moms would do</i>

00:22:23.842 --> 00:22:25.143 line:95%,end
if they didn't have something
to complain about.

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:28.213 line:95%,end
I'm so glad that Abby didn't
give Maddie that green costume

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.048 line:95%,end
or I know those moms would go ballistic.

00:22:30.115 --> 00:22:32.484 line:95%,end
So, ideally, we needed,
like, three and two

00:22:32.551 --> 00:22:33.852 line:95%,end
or all the same color.

00:22:33.919 --> 00:22:36.054 line:95%,end
All right, that looks the best.

00:22:36.121 --> 00:22:38.290 line:5%,start
PAIGE: Abby switched
my costume with Chloe's,

00:22:38.357 --> 00:22:40.158 line:5%,start
and I'm a little bit upset.

00:22:40.225 --> 00:22:44.129 line:5%,start
But now the problem
is my costume doesn't fit

00:22:44.196 --> 00:22:46.365 line:95%,end
and it's kind of falling down.

00:22:46.431 --> 00:22:48.667 line:95%,end
Of course Paige can't stand out.

00:22:49.167 --> 00:22:50.936 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Well, I thought
it was nice that she did stand out.

00:22:51.002 --> 00:22:51.837 line:95%,end
Yeah, so did I.

00:22:51.903 --> 00:22:54.539 line:95%,end
<i>So Abby would rather two girls go on stage</i>

00:22:54.606 --> 00:22:56.575 line:95%,end
<i>in costumes that don't fit,</i>

00:22:56.641 --> 00:22:58.977 line:95%,end
rather than have my daughter stand out.

00:22:59.044 --> 00:22:59.878 line:95%,end
I can't dance in this.

00:22:59.945 --> 00:23:00.779 line:95%,end
Why?

00:23:00.846 --> 00:23:02.180 line:95%,end
-It's going to rip.
-It's too small?

00:23:02.247 --> 00:23:03.382 line:95%,end
Definitely.

00:23:03.448 --> 00:23:05.350 line:5%,start
I kind of want to trade back dresses

00:23:05.417 --> 00:23:08.053 line:95%,end
to that Paige can finally
have this special part,

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:11.022 line:95%,end
and so that I have a dress
that fits me and that fits her.

00:23:11.089 --> 00:23:13.959 line:95%,end
I--I really think it would have been nice
if Paige could have kept the green.

00:23:14.025 --> 00:23:15.627 line:95%,end
That's what I wanted her to do.

00:23:15.694 --> 00:23:18.463 line:95%,end
I don't know how Abby expects
to meet these two studios

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:19.498 line:95%,end
that are coming to beat us.

00:23:19.564 --> 00:23:20.732 line:95%,end
<i>Our costumes are ugly.</i>

00:23:20.799 --> 00:23:22.200 line:95%,end
<i>The spoon is too small.</i>

00:23:22.267 --> 00:23:23.835 line:95%,end
The dance is doomed. (laughs)

00:23:23.902 --> 00:23:25.003 line:95%,end
I'm tired of fighting with her.

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:27.406 line:95%,end
I'm not fighting with her
over a pink or a green costume.

00:23:27.472 --> 00:23:29.674 line:95%,end
Either she can get your costume that fits

00:23:29.741 --> 00:23:31.576 line:95%,end
or you'll wear the one that does not fit.

00:23:31.643 --> 00:23:33.545 line:95%,end
I don't know how much longer
I can take this,

00:23:33.612 --> 00:23:35.514 line:95%,end
to have a dance teacher, like...

00:23:37.082 --> 00:23:39.217 line:95%,end
sabotage and...

00:23:39.284 --> 00:23:40.685 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>Honestly, I don't know how much</i>

00:23:40.752 --> 00:23:43.355 line:95%,end
<i>more of Abby trying to sabotage</i>
<i>the group numbers I can take.</i>

00:23:43.422 --> 00:23:46.458 line:95%,end
But I know she's just switching
Paige's costume to hurt me.

00:23:46.525 --> 00:23:47.859 line:95%,end
And, you know what? It worked.

00:23:47.926 --> 00:23:49.661 line:95%,end
That woman is just evil.

00:23:49.728 --> 00:23:51.730 line:95%,end
She is an evil person.

00:23:51.797 --> 00:23:53.365 line:95%,end
It's making me sick.


00:23:58.403 --> 00:24:00.338 line:5%,start
ABBY: <i>We've arrived at Energy Dance.</i>

00:24:00.405 --> 00:24:01.840 line:5%,start
<i>While my girls are getting ready,</i>

00:24:01.907 --> 00:24:04.609 line:95%,end
<i>I'm backstage</i>
<i>checking out the other teams.</i>

00:24:04.676 --> 00:24:06.611 line:95%,end
<i>Supposedly, they came to take us down,</i>

00:24:06.678 --> 00:24:07.979 line:5%,start
and I'm a little worried.

00:24:08.046 --> 00:24:09.681 line:5%,start
These kids are fierce.

00:24:09.748 --> 00:24:12.417 line:95%,end

00:24:14.886 --> 00:24:18.290 line:95%,end

<i>a duet, and a group number.</i>

00:24:18.356 --> 00:24:20.258 line:95%,end
<i>I hope these girls don't let me down.</i>

00:24:21.193 --> 00:24:23.728 line:95%,end
(cheering and applause)

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:31.570 line:95%,end
So our first routine is number 39,

00:24:31.636 --> 00:24:33.438 line:95%,end
the duet "Inside of Me."

00:24:33.505 --> 00:24:35.507 line:95%,end
Approaching this competition,

00:24:35.574 --> 00:24:38.243 line:95%,end
I know that I have people gunning for me.

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:42.147 line:95%,end
So I am using Chloe
and Maddie's duet, "Inside of Me."

00:24:42.214 --> 00:24:44.483 line:95%,end
It's a very difficult routine, level-wise.

00:24:44.549 --> 00:24:46.818 line:95%,end
I think it's packed full
of all the right elements

00:24:46.885 --> 00:24:47.719 line:95%,end
to be a winning number.

00:24:47.786 --> 00:24:48.920 line:95%,end
All right, you guys are ready.

00:24:48.987 --> 00:24:50.255 line:95%,end
Okay. Come on, girls. You coming?

00:24:50.322 --> 00:24:51.156 line:95%,end

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:07.826 line:95%,end
Moms, we need to get the hair done.

KELLY: Well, Paige
gets to put her big costume on.

00:27:09.828 --> 00:27:12.063 line:95%,end
It's unfortunate, because I thought
the green looked great on her.

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:12.998 line:95%,end
I know.

00:27:13.064 --> 00:27:16.134 line:5%,start
Paige has to put on a dress
that is two sizes too big for her,

00:27:16.201 --> 00:27:18.637 line:95%,end
just because Abby doesn't want her
to stand out in the group.

00:27:18.703 --> 00:27:20.572 line:95%,end
Ah, its just a little big there.

00:27:21.506 --> 00:27:22.807 line:95%,end
It's big.

00:27:22.874 --> 00:27:24.743 line:95%,end
Oh, well. It worked.

00:27:24.809 --> 00:27:27.012 line:95%,end
Both girls are wearing
costumes that don't fit.

00:27:27.078 --> 00:27:29.047 line:95%,end
It just doesn't make any sense.

00:27:30.982 --> 00:27:32.817 line:95%,end
ABBY: Make a big deal
out of the spirit spoon.

00:27:34.786 --> 00:27:35.654 line:95%,end
Smile.

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:36.988 line:95%,end
Shoulders, down.

00:27:37.055 --> 00:27:39.391 line:95%,end
KELLY: I just don't know
how much more I can take of Abby.

00:27:39.457 --> 00:27:40.825 line:95%,end
I have had it with her.

00:27:40.892 --> 00:27:42.193 line:95%,end
Brooke's putting her hand in.

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:43.795 line:95%,end
That's a valiant effort.

00:27:43.862 --> 00:27:46.431 line:95%,end
ALL: One, two, three, etiquette!

00:27:46.498 --> 00:27:48.099 line:95%,end
ABBY: The girls
are gorgeous in their costumes.

00:27:48.166 --> 00:27:49.901 line:95%,end
The spoon has a bow on it.

00:27:51.036 --> 00:27:53.238 line:95%,end
<i>We just have to hope</i>

00:27:53.304 --> 00:27:54.673 line:95%,end

00:27:56.574 --> 00:27:58.476 line:95%,end
ANNOUNCER: <i>Judges,</i>

(whimsical music playing)

00:28:35.013 --> 00:28:37.982 line:95%,end
ABBY: Judges like to see
something new and something different.

00:28:38.049 --> 00:28:39.551 line:95%,end
<i>I don't care what those mothers think.</i>

00:28:39.617 --> 00:28:40.785 line:95%,end

(cheering and applause)

00:29:00.772 --> 00:29:04.075 line:95%,end
ABBY: From a judging point,
I think it was a breath of fresh air.

00:29:04.142 --> 00:29:06.711 line:95%,end
I think the routine was light and pretty,

00:29:06.778 --> 00:29:09.414 line:95%,end
<i>and certainly different</i>
<i>than anything I saw.</i>

00:29:09.481 --> 00:29:10.782 line:95%,end
Do the judges think so?

00:29:10.849 --> 00:29:11.883 line:95%,end
I don't know.

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:14.185 line:5%,start
-(tense music playing)

ANNOUNCER: <i>Welcome, again,</i>

<i>We're going to get right to the awards.</i>

00:29:20.525 --> 00:29:21.659 line:95%,end
<i>All righty.</i>

00:29:21.726 --> 00:29:25.296 line:95%,end
And the Energy Junior Duet/Trio...

00:29:25.363 --> 00:29:27.432 line:95%,end
we have a top three.

00:29:28.199 --> 00:29:32.904 line:95%,end
In third place, entry 16,
"Stars on Your Grave Stone."

00:29:32.971 --> 00:29:34.672 line:95%,end
(cheering and applause)

00:29:34.739 --> 00:29:37.208 line:95%,end
In second place...

00:29:37.275 --> 00:29:40.378 line:95%,end
we have entry number 39, "Inside of Me."

00:29:40.445 --> 00:29:42.647 line:5%,start
(cheering and applause)

00:29:45.416 --> 00:29:49.254 line:95%,end
ANNOUNCER: First over all
is entry number 21, "Don't Y'all?"

(cheering and applause)

00:29:53.358 --> 00:29:55.293 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>We have some</i>
<i>serious competition here,</i>

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:57.896 line:95%,end
<i>and I think that Abby's</i>
<i>substandard choreography</i>

00:29:57.962 --> 00:29:59.164 line:5%,start
is just setting us up to fail.

00:30:00.899 --> 00:30:05.470 line:95%,end
<i>We have the Energy Junior</i>
<i>Small Group top three awards.</i>

00:30:06.404 --> 00:30:10.041 line:95%,end
<i>In third place we have</i>
<i>entry number 121, "Party."</i>

<i>And, our second place,</i>

<i>entry number 53, "Silver Spoons."</i>

<i>Small Group goes to</i>

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:31.796 line:95%,end
<i>entry number 131, "Dream Girls."</i>

00:30:34.666 --> 00:30:37.268 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>The studios who made</i>
<i>the trip just to beat our girls--</i>

00:30:37.335 --> 00:30:38.703 line:95%,end
it was a trip well worth it.

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:40.305 line:95%,end
They beat us, hands down.

00:30:40.371 --> 00:30:43.875 line:95%,end
So that group, they brought that trio
and then they brought a junior small group

00:30:43.942 --> 00:30:45.510 line:95%,end
to compete against "Silver Spoons,"

00:30:45.577 --> 00:30:47.178 line:95%,end
and they brought three junior solos.

00:30:47.245 --> 00:30:49.113 line:95%,end
They're here to beat us.

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:51.216 line:95%,end
Girls, last week you won.

00:30:51.282 --> 00:30:55.119 line:95%,end
Today studios came specifically
to beat the Abby Lee Dance Company,

00:30:55.186 --> 00:30:56.888 line:95%,end
and they did just that.

00:30:57.989 --> 00:30:59.891 line:95%,end
You win and then
you don't have to work anymore

00:30:59.958 --> 00:31:01.092 line:95%,end
because you think you're winners.

00:31:01.159 --> 00:31:03.661 line:95%,end
<i>These girls are not behaving</i>
<i>like we're at a competition.</i>

00:31:04.162 --> 00:31:05.763 line:95%,end
I don't know what's going on with them,

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:08.099 line:95%,end
but they better start
behaving like competitors.

00:31:08.166 --> 00:31:10.268 line:95%,end
Girls, this is so sloppy,

00:31:10.335 --> 00:31:12.670 line:95%,end
you might as well have
the other teams the trophies.

00:31:12.737 --> 00:31:15.540 line:95%,end
Maddie, Nia, Mackenzie--
you all have solos.

00:31:15.607 --> 00:31:19.344 line:95%,end
If you're aiming for second,
save yourself the aggravation.

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:20.678 line:95%,end
Save me the time.

00:31:21.946 --> 00:31:23.381 line:95%,end
Get it?

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:28.653 line:95%,end
Is there anything else she could
have barked at before they left?

00:31:29.153 --> 00:31:31.489 line:95%,end
Because there's nothing
wrong with second place.

00:31:31.556 --> 00:31:32.790 line:95%,end
I don't know.

00:31:32.857 --> 00:31:34.759 line:95%,end
But I really hope that they checked
and made sure Maddie's music

00:31:34.826 --> 00:31:36.294 line:95%,end
didn't skip this week.

00:31:36.361 --> 00:31:37.729 line:95%,end
(laughter)

00:31:37.795 --> 00:31:40.498 line:5%,start
This scratched CD
situation has gone too far.

00:31:40.565 --> 00:31:41.766 line:5%,start
I'm sick of hearing about it.

00:31:41.833 --> 00:31:43.935 line:95%,end
Either that or make sure it did.

00:31:44.002 --> 00:31:45.536 line:95%,end
(laughter)

00:31:45.603 --> 00:31:48.773 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I trust Abby when she says
that no one cheated.

(upbeat music playing)

00:31:56.748 --> 00:32:00.285 line:5%,start
ABBY: So far, this entire
competition has been a bust.

00:32:00.351 --> 00:32:02.754 line:5%,start
It's all coming down to my solo routines.

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:04.822 line:95%,end
Let me have Nia, Mackenzie,
Maddie, right here.

00:32:04.889 --> 00:32:05.723 line:95%,end
Let's go.

00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:07.025 line:95%,end
Now, what's done is done.

00:32:07.091 --> 00:32:08.493 line:95%,end
You can't go back and do it again.

00:32:08.559 --> 00:32:11.529 line:95%,end
But we are not about to lose
to those two other teams.

00:32:11.596 --> 00:32:14.065 line:95%,end
So either win or lose big.

00:32:14.866 --> 00:32:16.067 line:95%,end
What?

00:32:16.134 --> 00:32:18.870 line:95%,end
Maddie needs to emote to those judges.

00:32:18.937 --> 00:32:21.239 line:95%,end
<i>Nia's routine is really mature.</i>

00:32:21.306 --> 00:32:23.207 line:95%,end
<i>I need her to pull it off.</i>

00:32:23.274 --> 00:32:25.109 line:95%,end
And Mackenzie, come on, kid.

00:32:25.176 --> 00:32:28.112 line:95%,end
Just remember the dance
and stay out there do it. Please?

00:32:28.179 --> 00:32:29.647 line:95%,end
You need to prove that your technique

00:32:29.714 --> 00:32:31.716 line:95%,end
is up to the standard to do this number,

00:32:31.783 --> 00:32:33.451 line:95%,end
because there's a lot
of amazing girls out there.

00:32:33.518 --> 00:32:34.619 line:95%,end
Understood?

00:32:34.686 --> 00:32:38.289 line:95%,end
This is Nia's first solo
since the whole Miami debacle.

00:32:38.356 --> 00:32:39.891 line:95%,end
<i>And, I'll tell you what.</i>

00:32:39.958 --> 00:32:41.626 line:95%,end
<i>If that kid forgets this dance,</i>

00:32:41.693 --> 00:32:43.027 line:95%,end
there are no second chances.

00:32:43.695 --> 00:32:45.263 line:95%,end
I need to do that to my stomach.

00:32:46.164 --> 00:32:47.632 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>We're in the dressing room,</i>

00:32:47.699 --> 00:32:50.068 line:95%,end

<i>Maddie with her makeup.</i>

00:32:50.134 --> 00:32:51.936 line:95%,end
<i>She never helps my girls</i>

00:32:52.003 --> 00:32:54.005 line:95%,end
<i>I don't feel like I'm getting</i>
<i>the best treatment</i>

00:32:54.072 --> 00:32:55.940 line:95%,end
<i>and the best training</i>
<i>for my kids right now.</i>

00:32:56.007 --> 00:32:58.409 line:5%,start
And I'm going to fight
with Abby until I get it.

00:32:58.810 --> 00:32:59.911 line:95%,end
ABBY: All right, let's go.

00:32:59.978 --> 00:33:01.446 line:95%,end
Don't dance too far down stage.

00:33:01.512 --> 00:33:03.181 line:5%,start
Last week, my music skipped.

00:33:03.247 --> 00:33:06.050 line:95%,end
And hopefully, this week
nothing will happen to my solo.

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:27.625 line:95%,end
I don't think she's even going
to make the top five.

00:35:43.908 --> 00:35:47.111 line:95%,end
I think Abby's finally taking
her in the right direction.

00:35:47.178 --> 00:35:48.646 line:95%,end
You're a better dancer now, right?

Come on, Mackenzie.

Now, listen.

without doing your whole number.

00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:01.492 line:95%,end
You have to say on the stage
until the music is over.

00:36:01.559 --> 00:36:02.627 line:95%,end
Do you understand?
-Yes.

00:36:02.693 --> 00:36:04.629 line:95%,end
When Mackenzie steps out on stage,

00:36:04.695 --> 00:36:06.297 line:95%,end
I will be in the wings.

00:36:06.364 --> 00:36:09.033 line:95%,end
And if she tries to run off, I'm serious,

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:11.502 line:95%,end
she is going right back out on that stage.

00:36:11.569 --> 00:36:12.803 line:95%,end
Come on, let's go.

00:36:16.574 --> 00:36:19.343 line:95%,end
She knows the dance, you know,
but Abby freaks her out.

00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:21.212 line:95%,end
Every kid has forgotten dances,

00:36:21.279 --> 00:36:23.948 line:95%,end
and she's never helped them backstage.

00:36:24.015 --> 00:36:25.816 line:5%,start
I'm really nervous about my solo

00:36:25.883 --> 00:36:27.818 line:5%,start
because I might forget the moves, again.


00:36:27.885 --> 00:36:31.889 line:95%,end
And Abby would totally yell at me
if I forgot this dance.

00:36:31.956 --> 00:36:33.858 line:95%,end
If I forget my solo,
why would she put me--

00:36:33.925 --> 00:36:35.860 line:95%,end

HOLLY: Aw, Melissa.

00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:41.492 line:95%,end
She made me cry
for the first time ever.

00:37:41.559 --> 00:37:44.328 line:95%,end
Mackenzie remembered
every move in her solo.

00:37:44.395 --> 00:37:45.596 line:95%,end
She remembered everything.

00:37:45.663 --> 00:37:46.497 line:95%,end
I'm so excited.

00:37:46.564 --> 00:37:48.165 line:95%,end
She really made Abby proud.

Aw!

00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:17.061 line:95%,end
Mackenzie won first place,
and she got her first crown.

00:38:17.128 --> 00:38:18.729 line:95%,end
She was so tickled on stage.

00:38:18.796 --> 00:38:20.598 line:95%,end
Maddie was so proud of her.

00:38:20.665 --> 00:38:22.633 line:95%,end

that Mackenzie pulled out a win

in her age division.

<i>Who knew the kid had it in her.</i>

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:01.872 line:95%,end
But fourth and ninth?

00:39:01.939 --> 00:39:03.307 line:95%,end
I'm not happy about that.

00:39:03.374 --> 00:39:04.709 line:95%,end
(cheering)

00:39:05.943 --> 00:39:07.712 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Oh, good job!

00:39:07.778 --> 00:39:09.046 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I'm so proud of you!

00:39:09.113 --> 00:39:11.115 line:95%,end
-CHRISTI: And I'll hug Nia.
-MELISSA: I love it!

00:39:11.182 --> 00:39:13.050 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Good job, Kenz!

00:39:13.417 --> 00:39:14.518 line:95%,end
I don't know what to think.

00:39:14.885 --> 00:39:17.154 line:95%,end
KELLY: Now that the competition
is done and over with,

00:39:17.221 --> 00:39:18.823 line:95%,end
I want to go give Abby a piece of my mind.

00:39:18.889 --> 00:39:21.425 line:95%,end
Between the costume fiasco
and the scratched CD,

00:39:21.492 --> 00:39:22.827 line:95%,end
I've had it with her antics.

00:39:22.893 --> 00:39:25.196 line:95%,end
Abby, can I talk to you for a second

00:39:25.262 --> 00:39:27.098 line:95%,end
I just wanted to see--
is it, like, your goal in life

00:39:27.164 --> 00:39:28.666 line:95%,end
to make Paige feel bad?

00:39:28.733 --> 00:39:31.202 line:95%,end
Finally once she had the odd costume

00:39:31.268 --> 00:39:33.404 line:95%,end
and was going to have a second to shine,

00:39:33.471 --> 00:39:34.972 line:95%,end
and then you take it from her.

00:39:35.039 --> 00:39:36.173 line:95%,end
And then you gave her
one that didn't even fit.

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:37.475 line:95%,end
And it was, like, no big deal.

00:39:37.541 --> 00:39:39.577 line:95%,end
I'm not setting out
to hurt a kid's feelings.

00:39:39.643 --> 00:39:40.978 line:95%,end
You have to understand that.

00:39:41.045 --> 00:39:42.680 line:95%,end
Chloe was the obvious choice.

00:39:42.747 --> 00:39:45.049 line:95%,end
I needed all eyes to go over to her
because she started

00:39:45.116 --> 00:39:46.117 line:95%,end
-with the spoon.
-And I realize that.

00:39:46.183 --> 00:39:47.418 line:95%,end
Kelly, come on.

00:39:47.485 --> 00:39:48.719 line:95%,end
The dance is over.

00:39:48.786 --> 00:39:50.721 line:95%,end
We already did the competition.

00:39:50.788 --> 00:39:52.223 line:95%,end
They were second.

00:39:52.289 --> 00:39:54.024 line:95%,end
Who cares about the dress?

00:39:54.091 --> 00:39:56.994 line:95%,end
God forbid you would see Paige
stand out just a little bit.

00:39:57.061 --> 00:39:59.430 line:95%,end
ABBY: There's five kids.
You can see them all on stage.

00:39:59.497 --> 00:40:00.364 line:95%,end
Whatever, Abby.

00:40:00.431 --> 00:40:02.333 line:95%,end
I mean, it's something
different every day.

00:40:03.401 --> 00:40:04.235 line:95%,end
That's it.

00:40:04.301 --> 00:40:06.871 line:95%,end
I will not take these accusations

00:40:06.937 --> 00:40:08.873 line:95%,end
<i>and finger pointing, anymore.</i>

00:40:08.939 --> 00:40:10.007 line:95%,end
I've had it.

00:40:10.074 --> 00:40:13.811 line:95%,end
Girls, every single one of you know

00:40:13.878 --> 00:40:17.615 line:95%,end
the reason we change things
is because it doesn't look right.

00:40:17.681 --> 00:40:19.583 line:95%,end
That's why we change routines.

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:22.586 line:95%,end
Don't go accusing people of doing things

00:40:22.653 --> 00:40:23.687 line:95%,end
that they didn't do.

00:40:23.754 --> 00:40:26.490 line:95%,end
Win or lose, I'm not going
to send somebody out there

00:40:26.557 --> 00:40:28.025 line:95%,end
with bad music.

00:40:28.092 --> 00:40:29.927 line:95%,end
And if any one of your mothers
have something to say about it,

00:40:29.994 --> 00:40:31.762 line:5%,start
come to Abby and find out

00:40:31.829 --> 00:40:33.898 line:5%,start
what happens with the CD when it skips.

00:40:33.964 --> 00:40:36.267 line:5%,start
And we'll tell you exactly
what to do with it.

00:40:44.842 --> 00:40:46.944 line:5%,start
MELISSA: Come on, girls.
We're getting on the bus.

00:40:47.611 --> 00:40:50.514 line:5%,start
Finally, Abby has put an end
to the CD skipping issue.

00:40:50.581 --> 00:40:52.049 line:5%,start
<i>We both said our piece.</i>

00:40:52.116 --> 00:40:54.552 line:5%,start
<i>And if the moms don't believe it,</i>
<i>that's their problem.</i>

00:40:54.618 --> 00:40:56.387 line:5%,start
I'm not discussing it anymore.
