with a very open mind.

00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:37.730 line:5%,start
And I'm not going to have
any negative thoughts.

00:01:37.797 --> 00:01:39.566 line:95%,end
I'm thinking very positive.

00:01:39.632 --> 00:01:40.934 line:95%,end
How's it going?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.435 line:95%,end
Where's Holly?

00:01:42.502 --> 00:01:44.104 line:95%,end
Nia, where is your mother?

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:45.738 line:95%,end
She's at work.

00:01:45.805 --> 00:01:47.440 line:95%,end
Not going to happen.

00:01:47.507 --> 00:01:49.142 line:95%,end
Yes. She needs to leave work,

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:51.811 line:95%,end
leave the job, forget it,
and be here with you.

00:01:51.878 --> 00:01:53.012 line:95%,end
That's what's important.

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:55.215 line:95%,end
Yes? You want this. I know you want it.

00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:56.449 line:95%,end
I know you love it.

00:01:56.516 --> 00:01:57.917 line:95%,end
She has to love it for you.

00:01:57.984 --> 00:02:01.321 line:5%,start
When all the moms are there and one isn't,

00:02:01.387 --> 00:02:03.323 line:5%,start
I think Nia feels badly.

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:05.091 line:95%,end
<i>So I feel bad for the kid.</i>

00:02:05.158 --> 00:02:06.693 line:95%,end
And I get angry with the mother.

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:08.128 line:95%,end
If you're going to do this,

00:02:08.194 --> 00:02:10.096 line:95%,end
and all the other mothers
are there, be there.

00:02:10.163 --> 00:02:14.033 line:95%,end
Now, first of all,
you're national champions.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.036 line:95%,end
It was a great competition
at Starbound in Lake Tahoe.

00:02:17.103 --> 00:02:18.972 line:95%,end
That's something to be very proud of.

00:02:19.038 --> 00:02:21.141 line:95%,end
Then we got to LA, we did a video.

00:02:21.207 --> 00:02:23.510 line:95%,end
People know who you are now
from watching that video.

00:02:23.576 --> 00:02:25.912 line:95%,end
But you're a target.

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:27.180 line:95%,end
When you walk in,

00:02:27.247 --> 00:02:30.517 line:95%,end
it's going to be all about
beating the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:02:30.583 --> 00:02:32.886 line:95%,end
<i>Brand new season</i>
<i>for the Abby Lee Dance Company.</i>

00:02:32.952 --> 00:02:34.287 line:95%,end
<i>But everybody is after them</i>

00:02:34.354 --> 00:02:38.224 line:95%,end
everybody wants to see them fail.

00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.461 line:95%,end
We all know that Cathy is not here.

00:02:41.528 --> 00:02:43.930 line:95%,end
Because Cathy wasn't a team player.

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:45.431 line:95%,end
Where did that get Vivi-Anne?

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:47.667 line:95%,end
Nowhere.

00:02:47.934 --> 00:02:49.836 line:95%,end
I'm going to have an open audition.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.273 line:95%,end
A casting call for a new dancer

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:55.074 line:95%,end
for the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:02:57.177 --> 00:02:59.112 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>I'm definitely nervous</i>
<i>that there could be</i>

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:00.947 line:95%,end
<i>more than one replacement at the audition.</i>

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:02.682 line:95%,end
<i>I mean, my kids are always at the bottom.</i>

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:05.151 line:5%,start
And, you know, I'm constantly
fighting with Abby.

00:03:05.218 --> 00:03:08.288 line:5%,start
I mean, how do I not know
that she's not replacing my kids.

00:03:08.354 --> 00:03:10.423 line:95%,end
Tell everybody you know that we're looking

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.825 line:95%,end
for a new girl for this group,

00:03:12.892 --> 00:03:14.227 line:95%,end
maybe two new girls.

00:03:14.294 --> 00:03:15.728 line:95%,end
Everyone's replaceable.

00:03:15.795 --> 00:03:16.696 line:95%,end
Are you next?

00:03:18.398 --> 00:03:20.667 line:5%,start
Everyone's replaceable.


00:03:20.733 --> 00:03:22.735 line:5%,start
We know. We've heard. So are you.

00:03:22.802 --> 00:03:25.438 line:95%,end
First, Mackenzie.

00:03:25.505 --> 00:03:27.340 line:95%,end
You can't sit on the couch and eat chips.

00:03:27.407 --> 00:03:28.608 line:95%,end
You're not six and under.

00:03:28.675 --> 00:03:29.976 line:95%,end
You're seven and over.

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:31.744 line:95%,end
And I expect the same thing from you

00:03:31.811 --> 00:03:33.880 line:95%,end
as Maddie did when she was seven.

00:03:33.947 --> 00:03:36.182 line:95%,end
Next, Brooke.

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:38.184 line:95%,end
Brooke, why are you
on the bottom of this pyramid?

00:03:38.251 --> 00:03:39.485 line:95%,end
You had a great season.

00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:40.853 line:95%,end
But then you took a break.

00:03:41.454 --> 00:03:42.989 line:95%,end
You didn't show up to class.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.525 line:95%,end
Paige, same thing.

00:03:45.592 --> 00:03:47.126 line:95%,end
You can't take a vacation.

00:03:47.193 --> 00:03:49.062 line:95%,end
New rule, dancing year-round.

00:03:49.662 --> 00:03:51.497 line:95%,end
Nia, you want to win a title.

00:03:51.564 --> 00:03:52.532 line:95%,end
It's all about a title.

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.235 line:95%,end
Every time I talk to your mother,
it gets back to the title.

00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:57.837 line:95%,end
Your mother couldn't care less
about you winning a title.

00:03:57.904 --> 00:03:58.972 line:95%,end
She's not even here.

00:03:59.038 --> 00:04:01.908 line:5%,start
I'm the one who needs to be
there all the time, not my mom.

00:04:01.975 --> 00:04:04.010 line:5%,start
Because she has to work and stuff.

00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:07.213 line:95%,end
And she's not a dancer.

00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:10.717 line:95%,end

00:04:14.287 --> 00:04:17.357 line:95%,end
People recognize you, wherever you go now.

00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:18.958 line:95%,end
That's pressure.

00:04:19.025 --> 00:04:22.328 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>Here's our girls</i>
<i>with their first professional job.</i>

00:04:22.395 --> 00:04:23.863 line:95%,end
<i>My daughter gets the lead.</i>

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.065 line:95%,end
And she can't make it
to the top of that damn pyramid.

00:04:26.132 --> 00:04:28.101 line:95%,end
And Maddie,
you're on the top of the pyramid.

00:04:28.167 --> 00:04:29.702 line:95%,end
Because you won a national title.

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:33.206 line:95%,end
Maddie, Chloe, Nia,

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:35.008 line:95%,end
you're going to be doing solos.

00:04:35.074 --> 00:04:37.277 line:95%,end
Now Maddie,
it's not going to be an easy win.

00:04:37.343 --> 00:04:39.412 line:95%,end
It's nine and up.
And you're on the young side of the age.

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:41.614 line:95%,end
MADDIE: <i>I'm really not</i>
<i>that nervous moving up</i>

<i>to the higher age group.</i>

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:45.985 line:5%,start

a hard competition,

We're starting from scratch, right now.

00:05:01.601 --> 00:05:02.735 line:95%,end
This is going to be crazy.

00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:03.770 line:95%,end
All right?

00:05:03.836 --> 00:05:05.305 line:95%,end
Moms, I'm going to dismiss you.

They are going to be the best.

what it's supposed to do.

00:06:07.934 --> 00:06:08.901 line:95%,end
Wake up.

00:06:08.968 --> 00:06:10.236 line:95%,end
Do you want to be the dance captain?

00:06:10.303 --> 00:06:12.038 line:95%,end
Or do you want to be the one
walking out of the audition

00:06:12.105 --> 00:06:12.939 line:95%,end
because you got cut?

00:06:13.005 --> 00:06:14.340 line:95%,end
So take it from there, right there.

00:06:14.407 --> 00:06:15.541 line:95%,end
Come over here and do the walks.

00:06:15.608 --> 00:06:17.176 line:95%,end
I don't know.
I think it's going to be interesting,

00:06:17.243 --> 00:06:18.411 line:95%,end
open auditions.

00:06:18.478 --> 00:06:19.545 line:95%,end
KELLY: I think it's going to be weird

00:06:19.612 --> 00:06:21.214 line:95%,end
having somebody else in the group.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.982 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Let's all say a little prayer

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:24.684 line:95%,end
that they're not like Cathy.

00:06:26.486 --> 00:06:29.222 line:95%,end
(ragtime music playing)

00:06:32.525 --> 00:06:35.228 line:95%,end
Come on, guys. Let's go.
We got lots to do.

00:06:35.294 --> 00:06:37.864 line:95%,end
<i>Things have been really good</i>
<i>at Candy Apple's Dance Center.</i>

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:40.166 line:5%,start
We've got a lot of projects
that we've been working on.

00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:42.001 line:5%,start
And we're actually going to start
our competition season


00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:43.269 line:95%,end
a little bit earlier this year.

00:06:43.336 --> 00:06:44.270 line:95%,end
Go!

00:06:44.337 --> 00:06:45.171 line:95%,end
Oh my God.

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:47.540 line:95%,end
You're hiking her up
like she's a sack of potatoes.

00:06:47.607 --> 00:06:49.575 line:95%,end
<i>There's a couple</i>
<i>big competitions coming up.</i>

00:06:49.642 --> 00:06:51.944 line:95%,end
<i>We have a couple scores</i>
<i>that we have to settle.</i>

00:06:52.011 --> 00:06:55.848 line:95%,end
And when the dance moms
from Abby Lee Dance Center see us,

00:06:55.915 --> 00:06:58.284 line:95%,end
as well as Abby,
they are going to be blown away.

00:06:58.785 --> 00:07:00.753 line:95%,end
Vivi went to study with Abby Lee.

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.422 line:95%,end
They did something
that was kind of unique.

00:07:02.488 --> 00:07:04.023 line:95%,end
It was a pyramid.

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:05.858 line:95%,end
And it was kind of a negative pyramid.

00:07:05.925 --> 00:07:08.161 line:95%,end
And it was a big huge dissension

00:07:08.227 --> 00:07:09.829 line:95%,end
about who was always
going to be at the top.

00:07:09.896 --> 00:07:11.063 line:95%,end
Well, we're going to do a pyramid.

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.166 line:95%,end
There's going to be
somebody that's at the top

00:07:13.232 --> 00:07:15.301 line:95%,end
every time we go to compete.

00:07:15.368 --> 00:07:17.270 line:95%,end
And that person is the person

00:07:17.336 --> 00:07:20.006 line:95%,end
that will be having a solo
at that said competition.

00:07:20.072 --> 00:07:23.209 line:95%,end
And the first person
that we have on our pyramid

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:24.510 line:95%,end
is Ms. Vivi.

00:07:24.577 --> 00:07:26.813 line:95%,end
Then we have Sarah.

00:07:28.614 --> 00:07:31.684 line:95%,end
Then we have Kerisa.

00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:37.256 line:95%,end
Then we've got Taylor.

00:07:37.323 --> 00:07:39.859 line:95%,end
And Sir. Justice.

00:07:42.228 --> 00:07:45.965 line:95%,end
Leading us
into Candy Apple battle is Erica.

00:07:46.032 --> 00:07:48.000 line:95%,end
Since Erica's doing a solo,

00:07:48.067 --> 00:07:49.402 line:95%,end
she will be at the top of the pyramid.

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:51.270 line:95%,end
And you'll all have an opportunity

00:07:51.337 --> 00:07:52.972 line:95%,end
to be at the top of the pyramid.

00:07:53.039 --> 00:07:54.373 line:95%,end
Let's go. Let's get ready.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.442 line:95%,end
Let's do some rehearsing. Okay?

00:07:56.509 --> 00:07:57.977 line:95%,end
<i>We've got talent.</i>

00:07:58.044 --> 00:07:59.779 line:95%,end
And we've got heart and soul.

00:07:59.846 --> 00:08:02.582 line:95%,end
And we are determined
that we want to make sure

00:08:02.648 --> 00:08:04.851 line:95%,end
that Abby has heard us roar.

00:08:04.917 --> 00:08:06.519 line:95%,end
ABBY: Nia, are you in front of Brooke?

00:08:06.586 --> 00:08:07.854 line:95%,end
Are you behind Brooke?
Are you next to Brooke?

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.755 line:95%,end
What are you doing?
You're all over the place.

00:08:09.822 --> 00:08:12.158 line:95%,end
-CHRISTI: Abby has rendered me speechless.
-KELLY: How about how mean she was to...

00:08:12.225 --> 00:08:13.159 line:95%,end
-Poor Nia.
-...Nia.

00:08:13.226 --> 00:08:14.227 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I felt so bad for her.

00:08:14.293 --> 00:08:15.595 line:95%,end
It's not Nia's fault
that her mom has to work.

00:08:15.661 --> 00:08:16.496 line:95%,end
MELISSA: No. It's not.

00:08:16.562 --> 00:08:19.765 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Hello. How's everything going?

00:08:19.832 --> 00:08:21.067 line:95%,end
Hi.

00:08:21.133 --> 00:08:22.268 line:95%,end
<i>I spoke to Christi.</i>

00:08:22.335 --> 00:08:24.303 line:5%,start
She told me that Abby was being harsh,

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:27.907 line:5%,start
that she was being unreasonable,
that she even threatened to replace Nia.

00:08:27.974 --> 00:08:29.609 line:95%,end
How did that whole thing turn out?

00:08:29.675 --> 00:08:32.044 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I'm a little concerned.
She's getting a solo this weekend.

00:08:32.111 --> 00:08:33.479 line:95%,end
And you're not going to be there.

00:08:33.546 --> 00:08:36.115 line:95%,end
-CHRISTI: Are you not able to go at all?
-No.

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:37.650 line:95%,end
I wasn't at pyramid.

00:08:37.717 --> 00:08:40.353 line:95%,end
I'm the adult. Nia has no control over me.

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:42.555 line:95%,end
And there was no need for Abby to be harsh

00:08:42.622 --> 00:08:46.158 line:95%,end
or to take it out on Nia
because I wasn't present for pyramid.

00:08:46.225 --> 00:08:48.160 line:95%,end
Here you are.

00:08:48.227 --> 00:08:49.362 line:95%,end
Yes.

00:08:49.428 --> 00:08:51.564 line:95%,end
Just checking to see
if everything's okay between us.

00:08:51.631 --> 00:08:53.466 line:95%,end
-Because it doesn't sound like it is.
-No.

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:55.401 line:95%,end
The parents were required
to be here today.

00:08:55.468 --> 00:08:57.503 line:95%,end
Here, I think moms who don't work probably

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:59.171 line:95%,end
have a more flexible schedule.

00:08:59.238 --> 00:09:00.306 line:95%,end
But you know that I work.

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:02.241 line:95%,end
-So I cannot...
-ABBY: I don't want to hear a...

00:09:02.308 --> 00:09:04.610 line:95%,end
If you care,
and you want to speak your opinion,

00:09:04.677 --> 00:09:05.878 line:95%,end
you be here at the meetings.

00:09:05.945 --> 00:09:09.115 line:95%,end
I can't believe
this is starting already again.

00:09:09.181 --> 00:09:11.417 line:95%,end
Abby, let's not go there once again.

00:09:11.484 --> 00:09:12.752 line:95%,end
You need to be here.

00:09:12.818 --> 00:09:14.787 line:95%,end
I feel, right now,
that I care more about Nia's success

00:09:14.854 --> 00:09:16.589 line:95%,end
-than you do.
-No. Well, if you...

00:09:16.656 --> 00:09:18.457 line:95%,end
Your husband was here.
He walked right in the door.

00:09:18.524 --> 00:09:20.693 line:95%,end
-Why didn't he stay?
-Abby, if you want...

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.963 line:95%,end
My dad even took me
to the mother-daughter talk

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:24.931 line:95%,end
about getting your period.

00:09:24.997 --> 00:09:26.232 line:95%,end
My dad took me.

00:09:26.299 --> 00:09:27.500 line:95%,end
Because my mother was at work.

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:28.701 line:95%,end
Oh, my God.

00:09:28.768 --> 00:09:30.770 line:95%,end
She's talking about her period.

00:09:30.836 --> 00:09:32.405 line:95%,end
What the hell
does that have to do with anything?

00:09:32.471 --> 00:09:34.774 line:95%,end
I don't know. But I want to kill myself.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.242 line:95%,end
Figure it out. Because you know what?

00:09:36.309 --> 00:09:37.977 line:95%,end
-Abby.
-The kid needs somebody.

00:09:38.044 --> 00:09:39.245 line:95%,end
She's not that swift.

00:09:39.312 --> 00:09:40.546 line:95%,end
-How dare you?
-She's not.

00:09:40.613 --> 00:09:42.148 line:95%,end
-How--how dare you?
-She needs help.

00:09:42.214 --> 00:09:43.416 line:95%,end
-She needs you to be here.
-Oh, Abby.

00:09:43.482 --> 00:09:46.719 line:95%,end
-She needs people to take notes.
-Abby.

00:09:46.786 --> 00:09:49.188 line:95%,end
You think you're up here
because you have a doctorate.

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:51.624 line:95%,end
-And everybody else is down here.
-That's your problem, Abby.

00:09:51.691 --> 00:09:53.759 line:95%,end
You are intimidated by me
because I do have a doctorate.

00:09:53.826 --> 00:09:55.361 line:95%,end
Bull! Bull.

00:09:55.428 --> 00:09:58.331 line:95%,end
-HOLLY: Oh, Abby, don't be ignorant.
-Please. That's it. Go.


00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.536 line:95%,end
(cheerful music playing)

00:10:06.238 --> 00:10:08.441 line:95%,end
HOLLY: <i>I cannot make it</i>
<i>to the competition this weekend.</i>

00:10:08.507 --> 00:10:09.775 line:95%,end
Because I have to work.

00:10:09.842 --> 00:10:12.745 line:5%,start
It is extremely difficult
to bring myself to tell Nia

00:10:12.812 --> 00:10:14.413 line:5%,start
that I'm not going to be able to make it.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.248 line:95%,end
This is the deal.

00:10:16.315 --> 00:10:18.484 line:95%,end
This weekend I have to work.

00:10:18.551 --> 00:10:22.822 line:95%,end
Are you positive
that you can't miss work for one day?

00:10:22.888 --> 00:10:24.790 line:95%,end
I am very positive.

00:10:24.857 --> 00:10:26.959 line:95%,end
(slow music playing)

00:10:27.026 --> 00:10:28.628 line:95%,end
It makes me really sad.

00:10:28.694 --> 00:10:29.895 line:95%,end
Me too.

00:10:29.962 --> 00:10:31.631 line:95%,end
<i>It's kind of sad.</i>

00:10:31.697 --> 00:10:35.668 line:5%,start
Because finally dances
that I actually like.

00:10:35.735 --> 00:10:38.638 line:95%,end
And my mom can't be there for them.

00:10:38.704 --> 00:10:41.941 line:95%,end
But I will talk to her.
And I will make it very clear to her

00:10:42.008 --> 00:10:45.044 line:95%,end
that, if she has an issue
with my not being there,

00:10:45.111 --> 00:10:46.979 line:95%,end
she talks to me about it.

00:10:47.046 --> 00:10:49.882 line:95%,end
So even though mommy's not there,
mommy is there.

00:10:49.949 --> 00:10:50.783 line:95%,end
NIA: Okay.

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:52.685 line:95%,end
And I will make that very clear
to Ms. Abby.

00:10:52.752 --> 00:10:54.453 line:95%,end
I am so frustrated right now.

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.622 line:95%,end
I don't know if I want to stay, continue,

00:10:56.689 --> 00:10:58.624 line:95%,end
<i>and be a part of this team.</i>

00:10:58.691 --> 00:11:01.527 line:95%,end
<i>She's working 110%. She's giving her all.</i>

00:11:01.594 --> 00:11:02.895 line:95%,end
She loves this place.

00:11:02.962 --> 00:11:04.697 line:95%,end
<i>And that's not good enough for Abby.</i>

00:11:04.764 --> 00:11:07.199 line:95%,end

Thank you for coming.

some amazing talent in there today.

Break a leg, everybody.

You all realize why you're here?

You're auditioning for a spot

competition team.

00:11:30.823 --> 00:11:32.925 line:95%,end

<i>We've been here for four years.</i>

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:40.232 line:5%,start
And I think it's, you know,
ridiculous that we have to wait

00:11:40.299 --> 00:11:41.567 line:5%,start
in this line with all these people.

00:11:41.634 --> 00:11:43.035 line:95%,end
They're all strangers.

00:11:43.102 --> 00:11:44.170 line:95%,end

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:05.524 line:95%,end

of about five dancers

00:12:07.326 --> 00:12:09.428 line:95%,end
<i>Now I need to see them jump.</i>

00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:11.864 line:95%,end

00:12:11.931 --> 00:12:13.632 line:95%,end
Come on, girls. Give it to me.

00:12:13.699 --> 00:12:15.835 line:95%,end
That's not enough right now. Let's go.

00:12:15.901 --> 00:12:18.404 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>When I looked around</i>
<i>at all the moms,</i>

00:12:18.471 --> 00:12:21.841 line:95%,end
<i>it was weird to picture</i>
<i>any of them being part of our group.</i>

00:12:21.907 --> 00:12:24.176 line:5%,start
I mean, we're such a close-knit group.

00:12:24.243 --> 00:12:27.813 line:5%,start
And just to let an outsider in
is going to be really hard.

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.950 line:95%,end
ABBY: All right. Take a breath.

00:12:31.016 --> 00:12:33.919 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>I'm a little worried</i>
<i>about the new mom joining the group.</i>

00:12:33.986 --> 00:12:36.055 line:5%,start
Just because I'm constantly
looking over my shoulder

00:12:36.122 --> 00:12:37.189 line:5%,start
with Melissa.

00:12:37.256 --> 00:12:40.659 line:95%,end
And if I've got another one,
I can only look one way at a time.

00:12:40.726 --> 00:12:41.927 line:95%,end
ABBY: Next group, let's go.

00:12:41.994 --> 00:12:43.729 line:95%,end
<i>You need a kid</i>
<i>that's really going to fit in</i>

00:12:43.796 --> 00:12:45.397 line:95%,end

00:12:45.464 --> 00:12:47.533 line:95%,end
495, you can go. Thank you.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.701 line:95%,end
Stay. You can go.

00:12:48.768 --> 00:12:51.137 line:95%,end
<i>They can't be too old.</i>
<i>They can't be too young.</i>

00:12:51.203 --> 00:12:52.872 line:95%,end
<i>I don't want another Mackenzie whining.</i>

00:12:52.938 --> 00:12:55.207 line:95%,end
<i>I don't want another Brooke brooding.</i>

00:12:55.274 --> 00:12:57.009 line:95%,end
I need someone that's the right fit.

00:12:57.076 --> 00:12:58.110 line:95%,end
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:12:58.177 --> 00:12:59.345 line:95%,end
Thank you.

00:12:59.411 --> 00:13:01.847 line:95%,end
Look at my little baby out there.

00:13:01.914 --> 00:13:02.948 line:95%,end
Face directly to the back.

00:13:04.283 --> 00:13:07.787 line:95%,end
LESLIE: Good lord.
It's like they're in a cattle auction.

00:13:07.853 --> 00:13:11.657 line:95%,end
ABBY: As you know,
we were looking for one person.

(suspenseful beat music playing)

00:13:15.728 --> 00:13:19.165 line:95%,end
230, 201, 479, step forward.

00:13:19.231 --> 00:13:21.834 line:95%,end
(suspenseful music playing)

00:13:23.035 --> 00:13:25.871 line:95%,end
ABBY: Payton, you know I love you.

00:13:25.938 --> 00:13:29.041 line:95%,end
You're just not right
for this particular competition team.

00:13:29.108 --> 00:13:30.242 line:95%,end
So I have to let you go.

00:13:32.912 --> 00:13:33.946 line:95%,end
It's just not fair.

00:13:34.013 --> 00:13:35.781 line:95%,end
KELLY: I think Payton was just too tall.

00:13:35.848 --> 00:13:37.550 line:95%,end
And I know you
don't want to hear that. But...

00:13:37.616 --> 00:13:39.451 line:95%,end
LESLIE: Well, then put her on
in some other way.

00:13:41.954 --> 00:13:43.889 line:95%,end
(sighs) Relieved?

00:13:46.492 --> 00:13:49.028 line:95%,end
201, 479,

00:13:49.094 --> 00:13:52.965 line:95%,end
sadly, I have to let you go.

00:13:53.032 --> 00:13:54.633 line:95%,end
Thank you very much.

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.836 line:95%,end
230, congratulations.

00:13:56.902 --> 00:13:57.870 line:95%,end
KENDALL: Thank you.

00:13:59.872 --> 00:14:01.207 line:95%,end
Congratulations.

00:14:01.273 --> 00:14:02.441 line:95%,end
Congratulations.

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:05.978 line:95%,end
<i>I was so excited for Kendall.</i>

00:14:06.045 --> 00:14:08.247 line:5%,start
All of her hard work had paid off.

00:14:08.314 --> 00:14:11.183 line:5%,start
And I know
what she's going to do with this team.

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:12.618 line:95%,end
And I know that they're going to love her.

00:14:12.685 --> 00:14:14.820 line:95%,end
This is a legacy that you're joining.

00:14:14.887 --> 00:14:17.189 line:95%,end
She is now one of Abby's kids.

00:14:17.256 --> 00:14:18.858 line:5%,start
I am Kendall. I'm eight years old.

00:14:18.924 --> 00:14:22.228 line:95%,end
<i>And I just really believe in myself</i>

00:14:22.294 --> 00:14:25.331 line:95%,end
<i>that I can show Abby what I can do.</i>

00:14:25.397 --> 00:14:28.701 line:95%,end
I think I'm worthy to be a part
of the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:14:28.767 --> 00:14:30.269 line:95%,end
This is a tight-knit group.

00:14:30.336 --> 00:14:32.671 line:95%,end
And I'm not going to tell you
that it's going to be easy.

00:14:32.738 --> 00:14:36.709 line:95%,end
You're on probation
for the first several weeks.

00:14:36.775 --> 00:14:41.113 line:95%,end
And mom,
there's a competition this weekend.

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:44.016 line:95%,end
She has three days to prepare.

00:14:44.083 --> 00:14:46.752 line:95%,end
<i>I chose Kendall</i>
<i>because she has great potential.</i>

00:14:46.819 --> 00:14:48.220 line:95%,end
She was the right look.

00:14:48.287 --> 00:14:49.788 line:95%,end
She's a cute little girl.

00:14:49.855 --> 00:14:51.657 line:95%,end
She fit in well with the kids.

00:14:51.724 --> 00:14:53.158 line:95%,end
Thank you. You're all dismissed.

00:14:53.225 --> 00:14:55.327 line:95%,end
I will see you bright
and early tomorrow for rehearsal.

00:14:55.394 --> 00:14:57.663 line:95%,end
Okay. Thank you. Thank you all.

00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:58.664 line:95%,end
Jill.

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:02.668 line:95%,end
She's going to come in tomorrow.

00:15:02.735 --> 00:15:04.703 line:95%,end
I need her for a private
right after school.

00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:05.905 line:95%,end
I'm going to teach her a solo.

00:15:05.971 --> 00:15:07.840 line:95%,end
And then I'll be here to have her private.

00:15:07.907 --> 00:15:09.174 line:95%,end
-Thank you.
-All right.

00:15:09.241 --> 00:15:10.576 line:95%,end
Hey. By the way, congratulations again.

00:15:10.643 --> 00:15:11.710 line:95%,end
Thanks, Leslie. Thank you.

00:15:11.777 --> 00:15:12.945 line:95%,end
-ABBY: Thanks.
-Hi.

00:15:13.012 --> 00:15:15.347 line:95%,end
Um, I just need you
to explain a few things to me.

00:15:15.414 --> 00:15:17.950 line:95%,end
I don't understand why you cut Payton.

00:15:18.017 --> 00:15:19.251 line:95%,end
Why I cut Payton?

00:15:19.318 --> 00:15:20.686 line:95%,end
She's just too tall.

00:15:20.753 --> 00:15:22.554 line:95%,end
Come on. Find--you're Abby Lee Miller.

00:15:22.621 --> 00:15:23.889 line:95%,end
Find a spot for her.

00:15:23.956 --> 00:15:25.190 line:95%,end
She didn't make it for the first cut.

00:15:25.257 --> 00:15:26.926 line:95%,end
She just doesn't fit into that team.

00:15:26.992 --> 00:15:28.427 line:95%,end
-She looks too old.
-Why not?

00:15:28.494 --> 00:15:30.596 line:95%,end
She dances very mature.

00:15:30.663 --> 00:15:32.097 line:95%,end
I spent tons of money.

00:15:32.164 --> 00:15:33.465 line:95%,end
-And you know what?
-I know.

00:15:33.532 --> 00:15:34.900 line:95%,end
You're a very good customer. I'm not dumb.

00:15:34.967 --> 00:15:36.001 line:95%,end
And the kid was great.

00:15:36.068 --> 00:15:37.503 line:95%,end
-Well then tell me what it takes.
-I told her she was great.

00:15:37.569 --> 00:15:38.737 line:95%,end
What is it going to take?

00:15:38.804 --> 00:15:40.205 line:95%,end
You would have to cut her in half.

00:15:40.272 --> 00:15:41.974 line:95%,end
-She's through puberty.
-It doesn't matter.

00:15:42.041 --> 00:15:43.943 line:95%,end
You should find her a spot.

00:15:44.009 --> 00:15:45.344 line:95%,end
You bring in these strangers.

00:15:45.411 --> 00:15:47.680 line:95%,end
Those three girls left after you cut her.

00:15:47.746 --> 00:15:49.248 line:95%,end
What? They're strangers.

00:15:49.315 --> 00:15:50.783 line:95%,end
What--you don't know what they're like.

00:15:50.849 --> 00:15:51.951 line:95%,end
You don't know what they--what?

00:15:52.017 --> 00:15:53.285 line:95%,end
Is the one going to come from Ohio?

00:15:53.352 --> 00:15:55.688 line:95%,end
You have no idea what these people
are going to do for you.

00:15:55.754 --> 00:15:57.489 line:95%,end
-Leslie.
-I do everything for you.

00:15:57.556 --> 00:15:58.557 line:95%,end
-Leslie.
-What?

00:15:58.624 --> 00:16:00.826 line:95%,end
-Calm down.
-Bull crap. I do everything right.

00:16:00.893 --> 00:16:02.394 line:95%,end
You need to go home and rethink this.

00:16:02.461 --> 00:16:04.163 line:95%,end
Try to sleep on your pillow
and think about what you did

00:16:04.229 --> 00:16:05.698 line:95%,end
to me and to Payton tonight.

00:16:05.764 --> 00:16:07.232 line:95%,end
-Leslie.
-No. I'm done.

00:16:07.299 --> 00:16:09.468 line:95%,end
Payton is too old to dance
with those little kids.

00:16:09.535 --> 00:16:11.170 line:95%,end
Find her a spot, Abby.

00:16:11.236 --> 00:16:13.272 line:95%,end
Find other older kids.

00:16:13.339 --> 00:16:15.374 line:95%,end
Find her a spot. Solo, duet, anything.

00:16:15.441 --> 00:16:16.508 line:95%,end
Give her something.

they quit from where they were dancing.

00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:13.792 line:95%,end
There was like three people
that quit because of her.

KELLY: Melissa says
that people have told her

00:18:16.528 --> 00:18:19.498 line:5%,start
that Jill is like a crazy dance mom

00:18:19.565 --> 00:18:21.467 line:95%,end
and that she's heard
nothing good about her.

00:18:21.533 --> 00:18:23.168 line:95%,end
A couple of people said to me,
isn't it funny

00:18:23.235 --> 00:18:24.803 line:95%,end
how she wormed her way in here,

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:26.672 line:95%,end
after your kids got a music video?

00:18:26.738 --> 00:18:27.639 line:95%,end
And the next day I walk in.

00:18:27.706 --> 00:18:29.408 line:95%,end
And here she was, like, taking classes

00:18:29.475 --> 00:18:30.609 line:95%,end
and coming for this audition.

00:18:30.676 --> 00:18:34.313 line:95%,end
-Yeah.

00:18:34.379 --> 00:18:36.248 line:95%,end
MELISSA: <i>Kelly and Christi</i>

00:18:36.315 --> 00:18:38.584 line:5%,start
And they're already saying,
we think that Jill

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:42.488 line:5%,start
is going to be a problem in our group.

00:18:42.554 --> 00:18:44.389 line:95%,end
I'm kind of thinking the same way.

00:18:44.456 --> 00:18:46.625 line:95%,end

00:18:46.692 --> 00:18:48.093 line:95%,end
<i>I'm trying to give her a chance.</i>

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:52.698 line:95%,end
And I certainly don't trust people
who are like overly nice,

00:18:52.764 --> 00:18:55.033 line:95%,end
overly accommodating, sweet, nice.

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:57.803 line:95%,end
Because nobody's really that nice.

00:18:57.870 --> 00:18:59.138 line:95%,end

-I meant...

-Hi.

00:19:33.772 --> 00:19:35.741 line:95%,end
I'm going to put the pressure on that kid

00:19:35.807 --> 00:19:38.477 line:95%,end
and see if she sinks or swims.

00:19:38.544 --> 00:19:40.345 line:95%,end
Then you're going to take a giant step

00:19:40.412 --> 00:19:42.147 line:95%,end
with your right foot out, and drag.

00:19:42.214 --> 00:19:43.849 line:95%,end

Kendall, you need to

No. You were prepared honey.

ABBY: No tears.

You save those tears
for your pillow, in your room, alone.

00:34:17.188 --> 00:34:20.792 line:95%,end
You're going to humiliate yourself in
front of everyone in this dressing room.

<i>What I saw from Kendall disappointed me.</i>

00:34:30.301 --> 00:34:31.736 line:95%,end
She didn't blow me out of the water.

00:34:31.803 --> 00:34:33.738 line:95%,end
I was expecting this kid to come out there

00:34:33.805 --> 00:34:36.441 line:95%,end
and have the whole package.

00:34:36.507 --> 00:34:39.444 line:95%,end

But now it's time for the group number.

00:35:04.268 --> 00:35:07.238 line:5%,start
And we all know
it's a lot harder to dance together

00:35:07.305 --> 00:35:10.575 line:95%,end

Do you understand that?

You can't go from up here

KELLY: You're the one
that wants them to learn

00:38:52.763 --> 00:38:54.999 line:95%,end
a new dance every three days.

00:38:55.066 --> 00:38:57.401 line:95%,end
Everybody else out there,
I can guarantee you,

00:38:57.468 --> 00:38:59.804 line:95%,end
have been doing their numbers
more than three days.

00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:01.672 line:95%,end
How come I'm the only one
that gets aggravated?

00:39:01.739 --> 00:39:04.141 line:95%,end
Because you're the only one
that hasn't had a child.

00:39:04.208 --> 00:39:06.010 line:95%,end
No. But I had a mother and a father.

00:39:06.077 --> 00:39:09.513 line:95%,end
And if they looked at me one time, I knew.

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:11.048 line:95%,end
One look.

00:39:11.115 --> 00:39:13.818 line:95%,end
So I'm telling you right now,
it's 4:30 to 9:30,

00:39:13.884 --> 00:39:16.153 line:95%,end
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday.

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:17.054 line:95%,end
Plan on it.

00:39:17.121 --> 00:39:19.890 line:95%,end
<i>I'm allowed to say the routine</i>
<i>wasn't good.</i>

00:39:19.957 --> 00:39:23.694 line:95%,end
Most parents value my opinion
more than the three judges.

00:39:23.761 --> 00:39:24.595 line:95%,end
Whatever, Abby.

00:39:24.662 --> 00:39:25.996 line:95%,end
<i>I was so frustrated.</i>

00:39:26.063 --> 00:39:29.667 line:5%,start
I'm just not the kind of person
that's gonna sit back and shut up.

00:39:29.734 --> 00:39:30.835 line:95%,end
-No...
-I don't have to pay on time.

00:39:30.901 --> 00:39:33.037 line:95%,end
I'm Kelly Hyland.
I've been dancing for 30 years.

00:39:33.104 --> 00:39:34.472 line:95%,end
KELLY: I always paid
the whole year up front.

00:39:34.538 --> 00:39:36.741 line:95%,end
Because I'll show you
my Discover card payment

00:39:36.807 --> 00:39:39.143 line:95%,end
that shows for the past 10 years,
I've paid you in full.

00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:41.245 line:95%,end
You're the reason
I don't even take Discover any more.

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:44.482 line:95%,end
Kelly, go get a job.

00:39:44.548 --> 00:39:46.851 line:95%,end
KELLY: Oh, don't even go there, you whore.

00:39:46.917 --> 00:39:49.286 line:95%,end
Oh, you are a whore.

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:51.055 line:95%,end
So welcome, Jill.

00:39:51.122 --> 00:39:53.090 line:95%,end
-Yeah. Sorry
-Welcome.

00:39:53.157 --> 00:39:57.294 line:95%,end
JILL: <i>Kendall has never experienced</i>
<i>that kind of behavior from adults.</i>

00:39:57.561 --> 00:40:00.965 line:5%,start
And I don't know why
they let it get to that level.

00:40:01.031 --> 00:40:02.733 line:95%,end
Does that happen like all the time?

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:03.768 line:95%,end
It does.

00:40:03.834 --> 00:40:06.637 line:95%,end
Why do they get that heated?
Why does it go so far?

00:40:06.704 --> 00:40:08.439 line:95%,end
I mean, my God, name-calling.

00:40:08.506 --> 00:40:10.641 line:95%,end
Don't ever trust Kelly or Christi.

00:40:10.708 --> 00:40:12.977 line:95%,end
They'll stab you
in the back as quickly as they can.

00:40:13.043 --> 00:40:14.311 line:95%,end
They do it to me all the time.

00:40:14.378 --> 00:40:16.080 line:95%,end
JILL: <i>These moms are crazy.</i>

00:40:16.147 --> 00:40:17.748 line:95%,end
<i>If they ever pull that stuff on me,</i>

00:40:17.815 --> 00:40:19.950 line:95%,end
<i>they're going to see</i>
<i>a whole other side of Jill.</i>

00:40:20.017 --> 00:40:23.687 line:95%,end
It seems like the only person
I can connect with right now

00:40:23.754 --> 00:40:26.257 line:95%,end
is Melissa. I think I can trust her.

00:40:26.323 --> 00:40:28.826 line:95%,end
If they ever come after me
like that, verbally.

00:40:28.893 --> 00:40:29.727 line:95%,end
I'll stick up for you.

00:40:29.794 --> 00:40:30.694 line:95%,end
-Please help me out.
-Okay.

00:40:30.761 --> 00:40:31.729 line:95%,end
-I will.
-I might need that.

00:40:31.796 --> 00:40:33.364 line:95%,end
-Well, thank you.
-JILL: You're welcome.

00:40:34.532 --> 00:40:36.133 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>This season on</i> Dance Moms.

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:38.235 line:95%,end
Suck it up.
I don't want to see those tears.

00:40:40.037 --> 00:40:42.640 line:95%,end
<i>We are headed to Columbus, Ohio.</i>

00:40:42.706 --> 00:40:44.275 line:95%,end
You know who lives in Ohio?

00:40:44.341 --> 00:40:45.943 line:95%,end
Candy Apple's.

00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:48.679 line:95%,end
ABBY:<i> This season</i>
<i>Abby's taking the gloves off.</i>

00:40:48.746 --> 00:40:51.949 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:40:52.349 --> 00:40:53.751 line:95%,end
(scream) What is it? Let me see.

00:40:53.818 --> 00:40:55.619 line:95%,end
Oh, no.

00:40:55.686 --> 00:40:57.688 line:5%,start
-WOMAN: A freaking apple.
-(laughter)

00:40:57.755 --> 00:40:59.423 line:5%,start
You need to take your cheap dress...

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:00.958 line:5%,start
My dress is not cheap.

00:41:01.025 --> 00:41:03.861 line:5%,start
Be gone witch. You have no powers here.

00:41:03.928 --> 00:41:06.197 line:5%,start
ABBY: <i>I can't win with these moms.</i>
<i>It's going to get worse.</i>

00:41:06.263 --> 00:41:07.898 line:5%,start
I really don't care.

00:41:07.965 --> 00:41:10.067 line:5%,start
Payton deserves that spot before Kendall.

00:41:10.134 --> 00:41:11.469 line:5%,start
She's bigger than that part.

00:41:11.535 --> 00:41:12.970 line:5%,start
ABBY: You have a solo coming up.

00:41:13.037 --> 00:41:14.338 line:5%,start
-Let's pull it.
-Move along.

00:41:14.405 --> 00:41:15.439 line:5%,start
(screams)

00:41:15.506 --> 00:41:18.342 line:5%,start
-You guys never support Maddie.
-Because it's obvious Maddie does great.

00:41:18.409 --> 00:41:21.779 line:5%,start
I just don't know why
I let my kids do this.

00:41:21.846 --> 00:41:23.647 line:5%,start
Sick of these (bleep) (bleep)

00:41:23.714 --> 00:41:25.349 line:5%,start
Was it good?
