ABBY: <i>Previously on </i>Dance Moms...

00:00:02.569 --> 00:00:03.403 line:5%,start
It's broken.

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:05.071 line:5%,start
Four to six weeks she can't dance.

00:00:05.138 --> 00:00:06.172 line:5%,start
No.

00:00:06.239 --> 00:00:09.843 line:5%,start
I want Kendall
and Mackenzie to get beat.

00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:11.611 line:5%,start
I did not have an affair with my boss.

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:14.681 line:5%,start
-CHRISTI: Yes, you did!
-(bleep) you. I did not, you (bleep).

00:00:14.748 --> 00:00:17.584 line:5%,start
I'm giving you an opportunity,
and you're (bleep) all over me.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.486 line:5%,start
Abby's gonna tell you
you're doing a solo, and you're not.

CATHY: <i>What are you guys</i>

00:00:20.887 --> 00:00:21.855 line:5%,start
Win.

00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:24.124 line:5%,start
ABBY: Don't screw anything up.
Go out there and beat them.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.959 line:5%,start
-CATHY: They don't go to school.
-Shut up.

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:27.193 line:5%,start
Because my daughter is smart.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.161 line:5%,start
Don't tell me to shut up.

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:30.663 line:5%,start
Take your little technicolor ass
and get out of here.

ABBY: <i>Coming up on </i>Dance Moms...

This is the 2012
Abby Lee Dance Company concert.

00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:38.238 line:5%,start
You're getting thrown
to the wolves, woman.

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:40.206 line:5%,start
I'm going to chew you up
and spit you out.

00:00:40.273 --> 00:00:43.276 line:5%,start
-Just be prepared.
-She wins every number you put her in.

00:00:43.343 --> 00:00:44.677 line:5%,start
-I don't know what else to do.
-You left.

00:00:44.744 --> 00:00:45.712 line:5%,start
So we left. That's right.

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:49.416 line:5%,start
You always have excuses
why your kids get what they get.

00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:51.451 line:5%,start
Maddie, I asked you to do a solo,

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:53.486 line:5%,start
you said no,
I'm giving this part to Chloe.

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:54.454 line:5%,start
You need AA meetings.

00:00:54.521 --> 00:00:55.955 line:5%,start
You're a (bleep) liar.

00:00:56.022 --> 00:00:57.757 line:5%,start
Don't let the door
hit your (bleep) on the way out.

00:00:57.824 --> 00:00:59.192 line:5%,start
Honey, you can't afford a door.

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:01.061 line:5%,start

EMCEE: <i>2012 Myrtle Beach</i>
<i>Top Junior (indistinct)</i>

I am very proud.

Now let me get to the pyramid.

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:42.936 line:95%,end
I'm going to start at the bottom.

00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:45.105 line:5%,start
Paige, you're injured.

00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:46.506 line:95%,end
You're there
because you didn't dance.

00:01:46.573 --> 00:01:47.974 line:95%,end
There's nothing really
to judge you on.

00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:50.910 line:95%,end
Next, Maddie.

00:01:51.978 --> 00:01:54.614 line:95%,end
I asked you to do
a solo, you said no.

00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:56.049 line:95%,end
Maddie's doing a solo this weekend.

00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:57.183 line:95%,end
It's too late in the game.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.718 line:95%,end
I'm not--I'm sorry, Abby.

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:00.019 line:95%,end
ABBY: People don't tell me no.

00:02:00.086 --> 00:02:01.955 line:95%,end
That was an opportunity you missed.

CHRISTI: <i>You know,</i>
<i>I don't really know</i>

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:04.624 line:95%,end
<i>if it's fair to Maddie or not.</i>

00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:06.793 line:5%,start
All I know is our kids have been
on the bottom of the pyramid

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.661 line:5%,start
for lesser sins than that.

00:02:08.728 --> 00:02:10.864 line:95%,end
Next, Chloe.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.167 line:95%,end
We wanted a clean sweep,
a tenth of a point.

00:02:14.234 --> 00:02:16.269 line:95%,end
(applause)

00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:19.606 line:95%,end
ABBY: The next time
we come up against that kid,

00:02:19.672 --> 00:02:22.408 line:95%,end
I want you
to make mincemeat out of him.

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:24.077 line:95%,end
Do you understand that?

00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:26.779 line:95%,end
Next, Brooke.

00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:29.983 line:95%,end
Brooke, we didn't get the bonnets
till the last minute.

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:33.453 line:95%,end
<i>Your job was to get that bonnet,</i>
<i>put it on Maddie's head,</i>

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.721 line:95%,end
<i>and tie it.</i>

00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:37.257 line:95%,end
That was a crucial part of the routine.

00:02:37.323 --> 00:02:38.591 line:95%,end
And you did it.

00:02:38.658 --> 00:02:40.994 line:95%,end
And then Mackenzie.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.130 line:95%,end
Not only did you beat a boy,
you beat two boys.

00:02:44.197 --> 00:02:48.067 line:95%,end
And on top of the pyramid again is Nia.

00:02:48.134 --> 00:02:49.969 line:95%,end
(cheering)

00:02:50.036 --> 00:02:51.804 line:95%,end
ABBY:
Nia, it doesn't always have to do

00:02:51.871 --> 00:02:54.207 line:95%,end
with the dancing and the performance.

00:02:54.274 --> 00:02:57.010 line:95%,end
It has to do with all the other stuff
that goes into it.

00:02:57.076 --> 00:02:59.712 line:95%,end
Abby, Kendall deserves
to be on that pyramid.

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:02.916 line:95%,end
ABBY: Okay, first of all,
you have to understand,

00:03:02.982 --> 00:03:06.386 line:95%,end
Kendall is here
because she is replacing Paige.

00:03:06.452 --> 00:03:09.455 line:95%,end
The minute Paige is ready
to dance, Kendall's out of here.

00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:12.525 line:95%,end
Well, you could have told me that
three weeks ago before we started.

00:03:12.592 --> 00:03:13.459 line:95%,end
Why?

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:15.795 line:5%,start
Once again,
Jill got a little spicy with me.

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:19.132 line:95%,end
Why does she think she can just
walk back into my dance studio

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.568 line:95%,end
and get her kid
back on the competition team?

00:03:21.634 --> 00:03:22.735 line:95%,end
<i>You walked out.</i>

00:03:22.802 --> 00:03:24.204 line:95%,end
<i>You went to my enemy.</i>

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.139 line:95%,end
You're going
to have to beg, Jill.

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:28.274 line:95%,end
She wins
every number you put her in,

00:03:28.341 --> 00:03:29.943 line:95%,end
but she's not on the team.


00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:31.578 line:95%,end
I don't know
what else to do, honey.

00:03:31.644 --> 00:03:34.314 line:95%,end
I'm sorry, because I would not
have put you through this.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.615 line:95%,end
Putting her through what?

00:03:35.682 --> 00:03:37.550 line:95%,end
She just went
to a competition and won her duet.

00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:39.852 line:95%,end
She learned something.
She was fabulous.

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:42.388 line:95%,end
JILL: She's a winner,
but you still won't put her on the team.

00:03:42.455 --> 00:03:45.692 line:95%,end
The team part,
that's about commitment.

00:03:46.993 --> 00:03:49.028 line:95%,end
And your mother's
always ready to jump ship,

00:03:49.095 --> 00:03:50.697 line:95%,end
just like she was just now.

00:03:50.763 --> 00:03:52.098 line:95%,end
Understood?

00:03:52.165 --> 00:03:54.834 line:95%,end
I'm going to tell everybody
in this room right now,

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:57.837 line:95%,end
I don't want any altercations.

00:03:57.904 --> 00:03:59.205 line:95%,end
I don't want tears.

00:03:59.272 --> 00:04:01.307 line:95%,end
I don't want screaming, yelling.

00:04:01.374 --> 00:04:03.409 line:95%,end
This is a very big week.

00:04:03.476 --> 00:04:06.813 line:95%,end
We are doing the 2012

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:09.582 line:95%,end
Abby Lee Dance Company concert.

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:13.419 line:95%,end
It is not a competition,
but it is equally important.

00:04:13.486 --> 00:04:15.722 line:95%,end
This is our opportunity
to showcase

00:04:15.788 --> 00:04:18.091 line:95%,end
all of the dancers in the studio.

00:04:18.157 --> 00:04:20.159 line:95%,end
<i>They get to perform</i>
<i>all of the routines</i>

00:04:20.226 --> 00:04:22.462 line:95%,end
<i>that they've competed</i>
<i>throughout the season.</i>

00:04:22.528 --> 00:04:26.232 line:95%,end
The concert is also
a great opportunity for me

00:04:26.299 --> 00:04:29.035 line:95%,end
to market my studio
to the general public.

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:31.204 line:95%,end
Hey, I'm trying to get
new students out of this.

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:33.239 line:95%,end
We are going to be doing a routine.

00:04:33.306 --> 00:04:36.142 line:95%,end
The routine is called
"Light My Fire,"

00:04:36.209 --> 00:04:39.445 line:95%,end
and it's hip-hop.

00:04:39.512 --> 00:04:41.581 line:95%,end
MADDIE: <i>This week</i>
<i>our group dance is hip-hop,</i>

00:04:41.648 --> 00:04:43.416 line:5%,start
and I'm really excited.

00:04:43.483 --> 00:04:46.252 line:5%,start
But none of us can hip or hop.

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:48.788 line:95%,end
ABBY: Now, Paige, it's been weeks.

00:04:48.855 --> 00:04:51.357 line:95%,end
I think that you are capable

00:04:51.424 --> 00:04:53.893 line:95%,end
of performing in this hip-hop routine.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.928 line:95%,end
KLLY: She has to get approved
by the doctor first.

00:04:55.995 --> 00:04:56.996 line:95%,end
ABBY: Absolutely.

00:04:57.063 --> 00:04:59.299 line:95%,end
But it's going
to be with the boot on.

00:04:59.365 --> 00:05:00.967 line:5%,start
I got strict instructions
from the doctor

00:05:01.034 --> 00:05:04.604 line:5%,start
that she is to do
no dancing until four weeks.

00:05:04.671 --> 00:05:06.372 line:95%,end
We still have
another week to go.

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:08.007 line:95%,end
ABBY: Kelly, you're an original member

00:05:08.074 --> 00:05:09.142 line:95%,end
of the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:05:09.208 --> 00:05:12.412 line:95%,end
I would like to see
some of your classmates at the show.

00:05:13.446 --> 00:05:15.982 line:95%,end
My God, I haven't seen them
in 20-some years.

00:05:16.049 --> 00:05:18.985 line:95%,end
ABBY: I want those people
to see that the Abby Lee Dance Company

00:05:19.052 --> 00:05:21.921 line:95%,end
is alive and healthy and strong

00:05:21.988 --> 00:05:24.057 line:95%,end
and continuing
to educate children.

00:05:24.123 --> 00:05:25.091 line:95%,end
Okay.

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:27.093 line:95%,end
ABBY: Now, there's something else
we're doing.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.098 line:95%,end
There will be one person
chosen from each age level

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:35.435 line:95%,end
to win a very generous
cash scholarship.

00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:38.504 line:95%,end
<i>This is the very first time</i>
<i>that the Abby Lee Dance Company</i>

00:05:38.571 --> 00:05:41.507 line:95%,end
<i>Parents Association</i>
<i>has been in the position</i>

00:05:41.574 --> 00:05:45.378 line:95%,end
to give out scholarships
to continue their dance studies.

00:05:45.445 --> 00:05:47.146 line:95%,end
All right, ladies,
you're dismissed.

00:05:47.213 --> 00:05:48.214 line:95%,end
Girls, spread apart.

00:05:48.281 --> 00:05:49.882 line:95%,end
I'm going to start
this number right now.

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:53.519 line:5%,start
One, two, three.

00:05:53.586 --> 00:05:56.923 line:5%,start
I want everyone in the audience
to realize that these girls

00:05:56.989 --> 00:05:58.224 line:95%,end
can do it all.

00:05:58.291 --> 00:06:01.294 line:95%,end
<i>So my girls are going to be doing</i>
<i>a hip-hop routine.</i>

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:04.197 line:95%,end
Whatever it takes,
the Abby Lee Dance Company

00:06:04.263 --> 00:06:05.798 line:95%,end
is a full service studio.

00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:07.533 line:95%,end
And two and three and four

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.635 line:95%,end
and five and six and seven.

00:06:09.702 --> 00:06:11.137 line:95%,end
My girls hate hip-hop.

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:12.739 line:95%,end
JILL: Well, how do they know
if they've never taken it?

00:06:12.805 --> 00:06:14.273 line:95%,end
I'd love to watch
Paige hip-hop, though.

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.376 line:95%,end
-I have to tell you.
-Paige is funny.

00:06:16.442 --> 00:06:17.610 line:95%,end
She's like a wet noodle out there.

00:06:17.677 --> 00:06:19.645 line:95%,end
So who are you
going to ask to come?

00:06:19.712 --> 00:06:22.982 line:95%,end
I have no contacts
with any of my alumni.

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:25.618 line:95%,end
There are so many people
who hate Abby that won't come back.

00:06:25.685 --> 00:06:27.120 line:95%,end
Like, I'm going to call them
and they're going to be like,

00:06:27.186 --> 00:06:28.821 line:95%,end
why in the world are you calling me?

00:06:28.888 --> 00:06:32.592 line:95%,end
If I can't get people to come,
it's going to be my fault.

00:06:32.658 --> 00:06:34.694 line:95%,end
And my kids are going to be put
at the bottom of the pyramid

00:06:34.761 --> 00:06:37.397 line:95%,end
once again for something I did.

00:06:37.463 --> 00:06:38.731 line:95%,end
Why didn't she just call them?

00:06:38.798 --> 00:06:41.501 line:95%,end
ABBY: Teachers told me
that the day you got that boot on,

00:06:41.567 --> 00:06:43.936 line:95%,end
you were doing cartwheels,
you were doing tinsicas,

00:06:44.003 --> 00:06:45.438 line:95%,end
you were trying to do
front walkovers in it.

00:06:45.505 --> 00:06:48.841 line:95%,end
I rode the bus home
with you two weeks ago,

00:06:48.908 --> 00:06:50.743 line:95%,end
and you were up
and down and up and down

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:54.347 line:95%,end
and up and down that aisle
the entire time for three hours.

00:06:54.414 --> 00:06:57.750 line:95%,end
Do you like having a vacation
and not dancing?

00:06:57.817 --> 00:07:00.453 line:95%,end
I don't really look forward
to recital time or concert time.


00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.422 line:95%,end
-Me neither.
-Oh, really? I love it.

00:07:02.488 --> 00:07:06.292 line:95%,end
HOLLY: I find it to be an incredibly
stressful and painful experience.

00:07:06.359 --> 00:07:08.094 line:95%,end
-Me, too.
-HOLLY: It's right up there.

00:07:08.161 --> 00:07:09.829 line:95%,end
I think I'd rather have a root canal.

00:07:09.896 --> 00:07:14.333 line:5%,start
The annual ALDC concert is exhausting.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.303 line:95%,end
<i>It's a time filled with highs and lows.</i>

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.472 line:95%,end
We are all running on fumes.

00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:21.607 line:95%,end
I can't get up.

00:07:21.674 --> 00:07:22.909 line:95%,end
Come on.

00:07:22.975 --> 00:07:24.610 line:95%,end
JILL: It's not fair to my child.

00:07:24.677 --> 00:07:27.346 line:95%,end
She can have a duet
and win and a group

00:07:27.413 --> 00:07:28.481 line:95%,end
and be in a winning group.

00:07:28.548 --> 00:07:31.317 line:95%,end
And it has nothing to do
with her talent or her dancing.

00:07:31.384 --> 00:07:32.685 line:95%,end
-You left.
-So, we left. That's right.

00:07:32.752 --> 00:07:34.687 line:95%,end
-You left. So now you have to wait...
-And we're back.

00:07:34.754 --> 00:07:37.590 line:95%,end
...until it comes time
for auditions again to audition again.

00:07:37.657 --> 00:07:40.026 line:95%,end
Did your daughter leave the team
to go try out for cheerleading?

00:07:40.092 --> 00:07:41.961 line:95%,end
She didn't leave the team.
She asked permission to try out.

00:07:42.028 --> 00:07:46.165 line:95%,end
JILL: Oh, Kelly, you always have excuses
why your kids get what they get.

00:07:46.232 --> 00:07:48.067 line:95%,end
Going to a different studio,
Jill, is totally different.

00:07:48.134 --> 00:07:49.268 line:95%,end
-JILL: No, it's not.
-KELLY: Yes, it is.

00:07:49.335 --> 00:07:51.103 line:95%,end
-She went to a different studio...
-And she left for one week.

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:52.805 line:95%,end
You left for months.

00:07:52.872 --> 00:07:54.207 line:95%,end
JILL: Well, it's not different.

00:07:57.009 --> 00:08:00.012 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:08:05.885 --> 00:08:07.887 line:95%,end
Go into Studio A. Okay, babe?

00:08:07.954 --> 00:08:09.055 line:95%,end
Hey, you.

00:08:09.121 --> 00:08:10.056 line:95%,end
How are you?

00:08:10.122 --> 00:08:11.657 line:95%,end
What are you doing here?

00:08:11.724 --> 00:08:13.292 line:95%,end
You know,
I'm trying to come back.

00:08:13.359 --> 00:08:15.361 line:95%,end
Why would you do that?
Why would you put yourself through this?

00:08:15.428 --> 00:08:16.629 line:95%,end
Well, it's not me.
It's Kendall.

00:08:16.696 --> 00:08:18.698 line:95%,end
It doesn't matter.
What is she going to get out of this?

00:08:18.764 --> 00:08:20.299 line:95%,end
You know,
when I started this studio,

00:08:20.366 --> 00:08:21.868 line:95%,end
Kelly and Christi got to me.

00:08:21.934 --> 00:08:25.004 line:95%,end
You have no idea
what Melissa did to me.

00:08:25.071 --> 00:08:26.205 line:95%,end
They're never going to accept you.

00:08:26.272 --> 00:08:28.674 line:95%,end
And I don't like them,
and I don't think you like them.

00:08:28.741 --> 00:08:29.775 line:95%,end
Who are you going
to have on your side?

00:08:29.842 --> 00:08:30.977 line:95%,end
You're going to be
all by yourself.

00:08:31.043 --> 00:08:33.513 line:95%,end
You're going to just have
to defend yourself constantly

00:08:33.579 --> 00:08:35.281 line:95%,end
and your daughter constantly.

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:37.149 line:95%,end
I couldn't tolerate them before.

00:08:37.216 --> 00:08:38.618 line:95%,end
I'm not going to tolerate them now.

00:08:38.684 --> 00:08:40.286 line:95%,end
Then why are you here?
Then what are you doing?

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:41.420 line:95%,end
For Kendall.

00:08:41.487 --> 00:08:42.655 line:95%,end
This isn't about me.

00:08:42.722 --> 00:08:44.090 line:95%,end
And it was for Paige. It doesn't work.

00:08:44.156 --> 00:08:45.825 line:95%,end
-That's right.
-It's not going to work.

00:08:45.892 --> 00:08:48.227 line:95%,end
<i>When I saw Jill</i>
<i>going into the studio,</i>

00:08:48.294 --> 00:08:50.696 line:5%,start
I thought it was fair
that I would just forewarn Jill

00:08:50.763 --> 00:08:55.001 line:5%,start
that these women
will just chew her up and spit her out.

00:08:55.067 --> 00:08:56.369 line:95%,end
<i>These women are brutal liars.</i>

00:08:56.435 --> 00:08:58.304 line:95%,end
<i>It's not like Jill doesn't know</i>
<i>these people.</i>

00:08:58.371 --> 00:09:00.640 line:95%,end
Christi's a snake.

00:09:00.706 --> 00:09:03.209 line:95%,end
Melissa's a liar.

00:09:03.276 --> 00:09:04.810 line:95%,end
And Kelly's a snake.

00:09:04.877 --> 00:09:06.612 line:95%,end
Do you ever see
their husbands around?

00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:09.181 line:95%,end
They talk about their husbands
like they don't even exist,

00:09:09.248 --> 00:09:10.917 line:95%,end
or they don't want them to exist.

00:09:10.983 --> 00:09:12.318 line:95%,end
Well, they probably
don't want them to exist.

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:14.587 line:95%,end
Kelly talks sexually about men, and...

00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:17.189 line:95%,end
It's pigs.

00:09:17.256 --> 00:09:19.792 line:95%,end
JILL: I can't believe the words
that are coming out of Leslie's mouth.

00:09:19.859 --> 00:09:22.995 line:95%,end
Melissa might want to lose
her friendships,

00:09:23.062 --> 00:09:25.698 line:95%,end
her morals, her marriage...

00:09:25.765 --> 00:09:27.066 line:95%,end
-She doesn't have one right now.
-...for these women.

00:09:27.133 --> 00:09:29.001 line:95%,end
You have no idea
how it happened, do you?

00:09:29.068 --> 00:09:30.303 line:95%,end
-What, the divorce?
-Yeah.

00:09:30.369 --> 00:09:31.537 line:95%,end
Okay, let me tell you.

00:09:31.604 --> 00:09:32.805 line:95%,end
You ready for this one?

00:09:32.872 --> 00:09:34.140 line:95%,end
It's the day before Halloween.

00:09:34.206 --> 00:09:36.208 line:95%,end
Payton and I
are taking my nieces to Melissa's house

00:09:36.275 --> 00:09:37.243 line:95%,end
to go trick or treating.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:38.811 line:95%,end
And all of a sudden,
Melissa comes out and goes,

00:09:38.878 --> 00:09:40.346 line:95%,end
you know what, Leslie,
I don't have any Halloween bags

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:41.480 line:95%,end
for the kids
to go trick or treating.

00:09:41.547 --> 00:09:42.648 line:95%,end
And I'm like, well, I have--

00:09:42.715 --> 00:09:44.517 line:95%,end
she goes,
no, they like this certain kind.

00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:46.819 line:95%,end
And I told them I'd go get them
down at this pharmacy down here.

00:09:46.886 --> 00:09:50.456 line:95%,end
I'm like, okay. So we get in the car,
and we pass the pharmacy.

00:09:50.523 --> 00:09:54.961 line:95%,end
And she looks at me and says,
I want you to meet somebody.

00:09:55.027 --> 00:09:58.698 line:95%,end
And I pull into this driveway,
and there's this gentleman standing there.

00:09:58.764 --> 00:10:01.667 line:95%,end
And she says,
this is the man I'm in love with.

00:10:01.734 --> 00:10:06.105 line:5%,start
JILL: Leslie's acting
like a total immature baby.

00:10:06.172 --> 00:10:07.707 line:95%,end
<i>They're like high school bullies.</i>

00:10:07.773 --> 00:10:11.010 line:95%,end
You know,
they have this fake relationship

00:10:11.077 --> 00:10:12.445 line:95%,end
in front of each other.

00:10:12.511 --> 00:10:14.146 line:95%,end
And behind each other's backs,

00:10:14.213 --> 00:10:15.748 line:95%,end
they're talking about one another.

00:10:15.815 --> 00:10:17.550 line:95%,end
Find another group
for her to dance with.

00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:18.851 line:95%,end
This isn't about me.

00:10:18.918 --> 00:10:21.387 line:95%,end
I'm coming back

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:23.356 line:95%,end
You're getting thrown
to the wolves, woman.

00:10:23.422 --> 00:10:25.825 line:95%,end
They are going to chew you up
and spit you out.

00:10:25.891 --> 00:10:27.093 line:95%,end
Just be prepared.

to Abby's recital.

Now, who would have
sent these to us?

00:10:41.073 --> 00:10:42.375 line:95%,end
Should we go?

00:10:42.441 --> 00:10:44.043 line:95%,end
They invited us.

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:46.445 line:95%,end
It would be kind of funny,
though, because some of you

00:10:46.512 --> 00:10:48.681 line:95%,end
have never really been to other recitals

00:10:48.748 --> 00:10:50.850 line:95%,end
to see how awful it is
compared to ours.

00:10:50.916 --> 00:10:53.619 line:5%,start
Since I've been invited
to Abby's recital,

00:10:53.686 --> 00:10:55.955 line:5%,start
I would like
to bring some of my moms

00:10:56.022 --> 00:11:00.026 line:95%,end
to come witness what thrown together is
just to make money.

00:11:00.092 --> 00:11:03.462 line:95%,end
And Rhonda can take notes
on dos and don'ts of a bad recital.

00:11:03.529 --> 00:11:05.998 line:95%,end
I can't imagine
that her recital compares to ours.

00:11:06.065 --> 00:11:06.899 line:95%,end
There's no way.

00:11:06.966 --> 00:11:08.567 line:95%,end
WOMAN: Well, you put on
a very good show, so.

00:11:08.634 --> 00:11:13.005 line:95%,end
Not only am I, like,
mystified as to who sent these,

00:11:13.072 --> 00:11:18.010 line:95%,end
but I'm also laughing
because they're paper print-out tickets.

00:11:18.077 --> 00:11:22.515 line:95%,end
We can sit and watch her boys
and see how many pique turns they do.

00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:24.950 line:95%,end
And it would be a quick laugh.

00:11:25.017 --> 00:11:26.352 line:95%,end

Big move.

Bigger.

Start again.
And I want you to sizzle.

And we were given permission
from the doctor to walk.

She can do
all the upper body movement.

00:12:56.342 --> 00:12:58.644 line:95%,end
She can hit all the isolations.

00:12:58.711 --> 00:13:02.381 line:95%,end

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:09.522 line:5%,start
I have to say that our, you know,

00:13:09.588 --> 00:13:11.323 line:5%,start
beautiful, graceful,
lyrical dancers

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:14.360 line:95%,end
aren't exactly
the typical hip-hop prototypes.


00:13:14.426 --> 00:13:15.261 line:95%,end
CHRISI: <i>Payton!</i>

00:13:15.327 --> 00:13:17.663 line:95%,end
Is Payton here?

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:18.697 line:95%,end
Come in here.

00:13:18.764 --> 00:13:21.333 line:95%,end
<i>Payton is a longtime student</i>
<i>at the studio.</i>

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.769 line:95%,end
She is one of my best hip-hop students.

00:13:25.337 --> 00:13:26.705 line:95%,end
I'm teaching them
a hip-hop dance.

00:13:26.772 --> 00:13:28.641 line:95%,end
The star of the show.

00:13:28.707 --> 00:13:29.775 line:95%,end
ABBY: Seven, eight.

00:13:29.842 --> 00:13:31.710 line:95%,end
One, two, three, four.

00:13:31.777 --> 00:13:33.112 line:95%,end
Well, who didn't know that was coming?

00:13:33.179 --> 00:13:34.580 line:95%,end
ABBY: Do you see the isolations?

00:13:35.748 --> 00:13:38.317 line:95%,end
Hip-hop, she's listening
to what I'm saying, and she did it.

00:13:38.384 --> 00:13:40.319 line:95%,end
And you guys stand there and giggle.

00:13:40.386 --> 00:13:41.921 line:95%,end
You know,
is she (indistinct) to make them all

00:13:41.987 --> 00:13:43.923 line:95%,end
feel badly about themselves?

00:13:45.057 --> 00:13:46.425 line:95%,end
Yeah, for that.

00:13:46.492 --> 00:13:48.961 line:95%,end
But you're the ones
that get to go away every weekend.

00:13:49.028 --> 00:13:52.698 line:95%,end
You're the ones
that get a new solo every weekend.

00:13:52.765 --> 00:13:55.434 line:95%,end
Would you like to be
in our hip-hop dance for the show?

00:13:55.501 --> 00:13:56.936 line:95%,end
-Yes.
-ABBY: All right.

00:13:57.002 --> 00:13:58.537 line:95%,end
KELLY: It just irritates me that, like,

00:13:58.604 --> 00:13:59.939 line:95%,end
she's never been on our group

00:14:00.005 --> 00:14:02.474 line:95%,end
when we did a dance
that she's not good at.

00:14:02.541 --> 00:14:04.844 line:95%,end
Now that Payton's added
to the hip-hop routine,

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:09.114 line:95%,end
that just means that Leslie
is one more addition to my week of hell.

00:14:12.117 --> 00:14:15.888 line:95%,end
ABBY: Two, three, four, and up, and exit.

00:14:15.955 --> 00:14:17.189 line:95%,end
Breathe.

00:14:17.256 --> 00:14:18.357 line:95%,end
Stamina.

00:14:18.424 --> 00:14:21.093 line:95%,end
Let's put the rocks out for "Trapped."

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.462 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>These kids learn these dances</i>
<i>sometimes in a day.</i>

00:14:23.529 --> 00:14:25.898 line:95%,end
And now they have to remember
every dance they've done

00:14:25.965 --> 00:14:27.433 line:95%,end
to perform in her dance concert?

00:14:27.499 --> 00:14:29.568 line:95%,end
That's a lot to ask
of these little girls.

00:14:29.635 --> 00:14:31.570 line:5%,start
When we did the "Trapped" number
for competition,

00:14:31.637 --> 00:14:34.506 line:5%,start
I called it "Trapped"
because that was the name of the music.

00:14:34.573 --> 00:14:37.376 line:95%,end
And there's a little girl,
and she's homeless.

00:14:37.443 --> 00:14:39.144 line:95%,end
<i>I need to teach Maddie a lesson.</i>

00:14:39.211 --> 00:14:40.746 line:95%,end
<i>She's not always going to get the lead</i>

00:14:40.813 --> 00:14:42.848 line:95%,end
or the best spot in the dance.

00:14:42.915 --> 00:14:47.052 line:95%,end
You know, I asked that kid
to do a solo, and she said no.

00:14:47.119 --> 00:14:49.288 line:95%,end
So you know what, Maddie,
you don't need to be featured

00:14:49.355 --> 00:14:50.456 line:95%,end
in any of the numbers.

00:14:50.522 --> 00:14:52.625 line:95%,end
Maddie, I asked you to do a solo,

00:14:52.691 --> 00:14:55.261 line:95%,end
you said no,
I'm giving this part to Chloe.

00:14:55.327 --> 00:14:57.263 line:95%,end
She's switching
Chloe and Maddie out.

00:14:57.329 --> 00:15:00.366 line:95%,end
-For what?
-For this "Trapped" dance.

00:15:00.432 --> 00:15:02.968 line:95%,end
-I wonder why, though.
-I don't know.

00:15:03.035 --> 00:15:05.337 line:95%,end
To torture Maddie
for not doing her solo last week.

00:15:05.404 --> 00:15:06.572 line:95%,end
Oh, really?

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:10.943 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I think Chloe
is really excited to show Abby

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:13.545 line:95%,end
that she can dance
a featured role like "Trapped"

00:15:13.612 --> 00:15:14.713 line:95%,end
and do it well.

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:17.049 line:95%,end
<i>Abby's now giving away</i>
<i>four scholarships</i>

00:15:17.116 --> 00:15:18.751 line:95%,end
<i>to further your dance education.</i>

00:15:18.817 --> 00:15:21.153 line:95%,end
I think Chloe deserves
a scholarship.

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.255 line:95%,end
-Everyone's replaceable.
-Right.

00:15:23.322 --> 00:15:24.723 line:95%,end
Especially you.

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:26.892 line:95%,end
CHLOE: <i>We were in "Trapped" rehearsal,</i>

00:15:26.959 --> 00:15:29.495 line:5%,start
and Miss Abby
switched Maddie and I's parts.

00:15:29.561 --> 00:15:32.031 line:95%,end
And now I guess
I'm in the homeless child.

00:15:32.097 --> 00:15:33.132 line:95%,end
<i>So I'm kind of nervous,</i>

00:15:33.198 --> 00:15:36.835 line:95%,end
but I don't want to not take
that kind of opportunity.

00:15:36.902 --> 00:15:39.471 line:95%,end
ABBY: And One, two, three..

00:15:39.538 --> 00:15:42.141 line:95%,end
MADDIE:
<i>Since I didn't do a solo last week,</i>

00:15:42.207 --> 00:15:45.577 line:95%,end
<i>Miss Abby got mad at me</i>
<i>and switched my part</i>

00:15:45.644 --> 00:15:47.212 line:95%,end
<i>with Chloe in "Trapped."</i>

00:15:47.279 --> 00:15:51.116 line:5%,start
And it's kind of sad for me,
because I really loved my part.

00:15:51.183 --> 00:15:52.885 line:95%,end
And I loved acting it out.

00:15:52.952 --> 00:15:55.854 line:95%,end
ABBY: I didn't think
that was too bad, Chloe. Good job.


00:15:58.891 --> 00:16:01.894 line:5%,start
(upbeat music playing)

00:16:04.063 --> 00:16:06.498 line:5%,start
ABBY: Okay, ladies.
Let's get this--this down pat.

00:16:06.565 --> 00:16:09.668 line:95%,end
<i>This is our 2012</i>

00:16:13.372 --> 00:16:15.207 line:95%,end
Go, John.

00:16:15.274 --> 00:16:18.310 line:95%,end
<i>My students need</i>

00:16:18.377 --> 00:16:20.846 line:95%,end
Nina, look over your shoulder.

<i>I call all the cues</i>
<i>from the light booth in the balcony.</i>

00:16:24.249 --> 00:16:26.452 line:95%,end
All right,
let's go with this from the top.

00:16:26.518 --> 00:16:28.320 line:95%,end
Catherine's on stage.

Everybody is waiting

<i>We have to get through</i>

00:16:41.934 --> 00:16:43.969 line:95%,end
<i>The better the kids are</i>

00:16:44.036 --> 00:16:47.072 line:95%,end
<i>and the smarter they are,</i>

<i>At the end of the dance concert,</i>

00:16:48.974 --> 00:16:52.244 line:95%,end

<i>The kids are doing their very best</i>

<i>âªThey bring the place...âª</i>

00:17:04.556 --> 00:17:05.791 line:95%,end
Hey, hey, hey.

00:17:07.126 --> 00:17:11.430 line:95%,end
I have read bra tops
for the hip-hop number.

00:17:11.497 --> 00:17:13.265 line:95%,end
And I have red hats.

00:17:13.332 --> 00:17:15.267 line:95%,end
So you're going to have
to figure out how these stay on.

00:17:15.334 --> 00:17:17.703 line:95%,end
Now, girls, they're calling you
down to the stage right now

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:18.971 line:95%,end
for the hip-hop dance.

00:17:19.038 --> 00:17:20.906 line:95%,end
So what we're going to do
is we're just going to do it in this,

00:17:20.973 --> 00:17:22.941 line:95%,end
and then later tonight
we're going to run it in the costumes.

00:17:23.008 --> 00:17:23.876 line:95%,end
Understood?

00:17:23.942 --> 00:17:26.678 line:95%,end
Did you run that
already for lighting?

00:17:26.745 --> 00:17:28.180 line:95%,end
-Yes, I did.
-ABBY: Yes?

00:17:28.247 --> 00:17:30.015 line:95%,end
So we're doing
the hip-hop dance first.

00:17:30.082 --> 00:17:32.785 line:95%,end
Hurry up. Throw a black leotard on
and your boots.

00:17:32.851 --> 00:17:35.621 line:5%,start
PAYTON: I'm in 15 numbers this year,
and every single number I'm in

00:17:35.687 --> 00:17:36.688 line:5%,start
has a quick change.

00:17:36.755 --> 00:17:39.191 line:5%,start
I don't get how Abby expects me
to make it out in time.

00:17:39.258 --> 00:17:40.793 line:95%,end
KELLY:
Question about the hip-hop dance.

00:17:40.859 --> 00:17:42.628 line:95%,end
-What?
-I was under the impression

00:17:42.694 --> 00:17:44.997 line:95%,end
that Paige was just going
to be doing upper movements.

00:17:45.064 --> 00:17:46.799 line:95%,end
-So did I.
-KELLY: Arm movements and stuff.

00:17:46.865 --> 00:17:48.267 line:95%,end
-That's what I told her.
-Well, she obviously

00:17:48.333 --> 00:17:51.437 line:95%,end
was not just doing upper movements
because she broke her boot.

00:17:51.503 --> 00:17:52.337 line:95%,end
Pfft.

00:17:52.404 --> 00:17:54.606 line:95%,end
<i>I'm rehearsing three shows in one day,</i>

00:17:54.673 --> 00:17:58.610 line:95%,end
and I am too busy
for any mother

00:17:58.677 --> 00:18:01.680 line:95%,end
or any kid to interrupt my plans.

00:18:02.748 --> 00:18:05.050 line:95%,end
Is anyone in children in elite point?

00:18:05.117 --> 00:18:07.119 line:95%,end
Payton?

00:18:07.186 --> 00:18:08.320 line:95%,end
No, that doesn't work.

00:18:08.387 --> 00:18:09.655 line:95%,end
All right.

00:18:09.721 --> 00:18:11.223 line:95%,end
I'm going to need a minute to fix this,

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:13.125 line:95%,end
so let's just go
with this hip-hop number.

00:18:14.159 --> 00:18:16.495 line:95%,end
You're in the fire
with all the smoke.

00:18:17.696 --> 00:18:21.834 line:5%,start
SINGER: <i>âªMiddle of the night,</i>

Abby.

Did you see the lineup
that Payton's in?

00:18:29.208 --> 00:18:30.442 line:95%,end
She can't do that.

00:18:31.477 --> 00:18:33.045 line:95%,end
No, there's no way.

00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:34.646 line:95%,end
Janine, take care of her.

00:18:34.713 --> 00:18:36.148 line:95%,end
We understand. We're fixing it.

00:18:36.215 --> 00:18:37.483 line:95%,end
But we can't fix it right this second.

00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:38.784 line:95%,end
We have to wait
till we have a break.

00:18:38.851 --> 00:18:40.786 line:95%,end
-I get that.
-ABBY: Everybody here is getting paid.

00:18:40.853 --> 00:18:43.222 line:95%,end
I get that. But this is my schedule, too,
that I have...

00:18:43.288 --> 00:18:44.423 line:95%,end
I know, but you
shouldn't even be in here.

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:45.991 line:95%,end
Because right now
you're wasting my time.

00:18:46.058 --> 00:18:49.428 line:95%,end
<i>Leslie couldn't wait till I figured it out</i>

00:18:49.495 --> 00:18:50.996 line:95%,end
that we needed
another number added in

00:18:51.063 --> 00:18:52.631 line:95%,end
so that Payton could make a change. No.

00:18:52.698 --> 00:18:55.000 line:95%,end
This is just not all about her.
It's about all the kids.

00:18:55.067 --> 00:18:57.536 line:95%,end
No, it's about whether she can make it
on stage in one number.

00:18:57.603 --> 00:18:58.837 line:95%,end
That's what it's about.

00:18:58.904 --> 00:19:01.006 line:95%,end
Well, she better make it on stage
in one number.

00:19:01.073 --> 00:19:02.174 line:95%,end
Every other number?

00:19:02.241 --> 00:19:04.009 line:95%,end
You have her in one number
before that with ballet.

00:19:04.076 --> 00:19:06.211 line:95%,end
I just came up
and asked you to correct the line-up.

00:19:06.278 --> 00:19:08.180 line:95%,end
-That's all.
-I know. But you have a smart-ass mouth.

00:19:08.247 --> 00:19:10.082 line:95%,end
No, I didn't.
You turned it into that way.

00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:11.383 line:95%,end
You shouldn't be in here.

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:12.584 line:95%,end
This is off limits.

Ladies, I need to remind you,

absolutely no parents in the lightbox.

I'm seriously, ladies.

00:19:34.907 --> 00:19:35.974 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:19:36.041 --> 00:19:40.245 line:95%,end
SINGER: <i>âªOh, light my fireâª</i>

00:19:40.312 --> 00:19:42.247 line:95%,end
ABBY: That was it right there.
That's not right.

00:19:42.314 --> 00:19:44.349 line:95%,end
Paige, there's really not a lot
of footwork.

00:19:44.416 --> 00:19:47.586 line:95%,end
Now, if you can't do
the inverting your knee

00:19:47.653 --> 00:19:49.755 line:95%,end
or the digging
or the bevelling,

00:19:49.821 --> 00:19:51.690 line:95%,end
you can still do from the waist up.

00:19:51.757 --> 00:19:53.825 line:95%,end
Payton's really drawing
my eyes downstage.

00:19:53.892 --> 00:19:55.394 line:95%,end
I didn't even look at the boot.

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:58.764 line:95%,end
But I'm not concerned
about you seeing the boot.

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:01.300 line:95%,end
I'm concerned about the foot
being broke in the boot.

00:20:02.801 --> 00:20:07.406 line:95%,end
Our agreement was she could dance
from the waist up.

00:20:07.472 --> 00:20:10.375 line:95%,end
Well, then just do the arms, Paige.
Modify it.

00:20:10.442 --> 00:20:12.778 line:95%,end
So when you walk out to your spot
at the beginning--


00:20:12.844 --> 00:20:14.313 line:95%,end
let's take it from the top.

00:20:15.814 --> 00:20:17.115 line:95%,end
She looks like an idiot.

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:19.785 line:95%,end
You still have to bend.

00:20:21.353 --> 00:20:22.854 line:95%,end
This is stupid.

00:20:26.992 --> 00:20:28.327 line:95%,end
-She can't do that.
-No.

00:20:28.393 --> 00:20:29.428 line:95%,end
Sorry.

00:20:29.494 --> 00:20:32.197 line:95%,end
ABBY: Don't do the feet, Paige.
Just do those arms big.

00:20:32.264 --> 00:20:34.700 line:95%,end
KELLY: Is she still doing, like,
where she kneels down

00:20:34.766 --> 00:20:36.435 line:95%,end
and goes to push-up position

00:20:36.501 --> 00:20:37.936 line:95%,end
and kneels back down and stands up
and stuff.

00:20:38.003 --> 00:20:40.505 line:95%,end
Because that's all right on the part
of her foot that's broken.

00:20:40.572 --> 00:20:44.109 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>Kelly takes it upon herself</i>
<i>to scream from the audience.</i>

00:20:44.176 --> 00:20:47.512 line:95%,end
Paige needs to sit down, her poor foot,
she needs to sit down.

00:20:47.579 --> 00:20:49.548 line:95%,end
Well, you know what,
you can go home and sit down.

00:20:49.615 --> 00:20:51.883 line:95%,end
Go over there on that part quickly.

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:53.852 line:95%,end
I have about two more minutes
to spend on this.

00:20:53.919 --> 00:20:56.121 line:95%,end
KELLY: I don't want you
to have to redo this whole dance.

00:20:56.188 --> 00:20:58.624 line:95%,end
Paige just doesn't need to be in it.

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:01.193 line:95%,end
Am I allowed to come up there?

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:03.195 line:95%,end
ABBY: No, I need to start again. Paige.

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:05.831 line:95%,end
Paige.

00:21:07.766 --> 00:21:09.134 line:95%,end
She said it hurts.
She's sitting down.

00:21:09.201 --> 00:21:10.302 line:95%,end
She can't stand up.

00:21:11.336 --> 00:21:12.204 line:95%,end
We're getting ice.

00:21:12.271 --> 00:21:13.672 line:95%,end
Okay.

00:21:13.739 --> 00:21:15.407 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>My agreement</i>
<i>was for Paige</i>

00:21:15.474 --> 00:21:17.743 line:95%,end
<i>to do the dance</i>
<i>from the waist up.</i>

00:21:17.809 --> 00:21:20.279 line:5%,start
I mean, I had strict instructions
from the doctor,

00:21:20.345 --> 00:21:22.447 line:95%,end
<i>no dancing for four weeks.</i>

00:21:22.514 --> 00:21:24.549 line:95%,end
I know you want to.

00:21:24.616 --> 00:21:28.587 line:95%,end
You can't injure it more
and not be able to do nationals.

00:21:28.654 --> 00:21:31.156 line:95%,end
I have to step up being a mom,

00:21:31.223 --> 00:21:35.260 line:95%,end
<i>and Paige's health is way more important</i>
<i>than being in a stupid dance.</i>

00:21:35.327 --> 00:21:36.328 line:95%,end
ABBY: Well, what do you want to do?

00:21:36.395 --> 00:21:37.829 line:95%,end
Do you want to try
to change the dance?

00:21:37.896 --> 00:21:40.165 line:95%,end
Do you want to modify it?
Do you want to sit in the fire?

00:21:40.232 --> 00:21:41.600 line:95%,end
Do you want to not do it at all?

00:21:41.667 --> 00:21:43.769 line:95%,end
Do you want to get a new boot?

00:21:43.835 --> 00:21:46.071 line:95%,end
-It's her year-end dance concert.
-KELLY: I know.

00:21:46.138 --> 00:21:47.372 line:95%,end
ABY: I don't want her
to spend the whole time

00:21:47.439 --> 00:21:49.041 line:95%,end
-sitting in the audience.
-I know.

00:21:49.107 --> 00:21:51.777 line:95%,end
So if you're fine and dandy
and you can go out there

00:21:51.843 --> 00:21:54.746 line:95%,end
and you can do it
and the boot is supporting you, fine.

00:21:54.813 --> 00:21:57.516 line:95%,end
If you don't want to do it at all, fine.

00:21:57.582 --> 00:21:58.817 line:95%,end
I'm okay with both.

00:21:58.884 --> 00:22:01.920 line:95%,end
Honey, I just don't have time
to re-choreograph

00:22:01.987 --> 00:22:04.423 line:95%,end
-a dance on stage from...
-Well, that's what I'm saying.

00:22:04.489 --> 00:22:06.558 line:95%,end
I don't want you to have
to re-choreograph it.

00:22:06.625 --> 00:22:08.393 line:95%,end
-I just...
-ABBY: All right?

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:10.395 line:95%,end
And if it comes to you
having to change everything,

00:22:10.462 --> 00:22:12.064 line:95%,end
she might as well just not do it.

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:14.032 line:95%,end
All right.

00:22:14.099 --> 00:22:15.167 line:95%,end
On with the show.

00:22:17.836 --> 00:22:19.438 line:95%,end
-Why did she practice last night?
-I don't know.

00:22:19.504 --> 00:22:20.739 line:95%,end
To not let her down?

00:22:20.806 --> 00:22:23.008 line:95%,end
Leslie, she was supposed
to only dance

00:22:23.075 --> 00:22:26.144 line:95%,end
from the top up
and be a statue in the back.

00:22:26.211 --> 00:22:28.180 line:95%,end
-So why didn't she do that?
-Well, I wasn't at rehearsal,

00:22:28.246 --> 00:22:29.881 line:95%,end
and they were teaching it to her.

00:22:29.948 --> 00:22:32.117 line:95%,end
Well, I was at rehearsal,
and she didn't speak up.

00:22:32.184 --> 00:22:34.186 line:95%,end
I said it once.

00:22:34.252 --> 00:22:35.354 line:95%,end
And they told...

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:36.421 line:95%,end
LESLIE: I didn't hear you.

00:22:36.488 --> 00:22:38.357 line:95%,end
Why did she show up
for the rehearsal

00:22:38.423 --> 00:22:40.559 line:95%,end
if you knew that's the only number
they were practicing?

00:22:41.993 --> 00:22:43.929 line:95%,end
Because she was supposed
to be in the number, Leslie.

00:22:43.995 --> 00:22:46.898 line:5%,start
LESLIE: Everybody knows that hip-hop
is a really hard dance.

00:22:46.965 --> 00:22:48.200 line:5%,start
You know, you're up, you're down,

00:22:48.266 --> 00:22:50.068 line:5%,start
you have to bend your--
you know, you bend at the knees.

00:22:50.135 --> 00:22:51.336 line:95%,end
You're hopping, you're jumping.

00:22:51.403 --> 00:22:55.140 line:95%,end
And I'm a little surprised
that she is still in it,

00:22:55.207 --> 00:22:57.342 line:95%,end
being that Kelly pulls her kids

00:22:57.409 --> 00:23:00.946 line:95%,end
out of umpteen numbers time after time.

00:23:01.012 --> 00:23:03.815 line:95%,end
I don't unders--if she's hurt,
why was she supposed to be in the number?

00:23:03.882 --> 00:23:05.517 line:95%,end
Abby wanted her in the recital.

00:23:05.584 --> 00:23:08.019 line:95%,end
So she was supposed to stand
in the back of the number

00:23:08.086 --> 00:23:11.189 line:95%,end
and dance from the waist up at the fire.

00:23:11.256 --> 00:23:13.859 line:95%,end
LESLIE: Were you one of the mothers
that was in there videoing it?

00:23:13.925 --> 00:23:14.926 line:95%,end
No, I was not.

00:23:14.993 --> 00:23:16.495 line:95%,end
Okay, well, everybody else was.

00:23:16.561 --> 00:23:17.796 line:95%,end
And if I would have known,
I would have told you.

00:23:17.863 --> 00:23:18.830 line:95%,end
I was there videoing.

00:23:18.897 --> 00:23:21.066 line:95%,end
And so were all these other mothers,
if they would have told you.

00:23:21.133 --> 00:23:23.935 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>I was hoping to not have to deal</i>
<i>with Leslie this weekend.</i>

00:23:24.002 --> 00:23:27.172 line:95%,end
<i>I have enough pressure on me</i>
<i>at the dance concert right now.</i>

00:23:27.239 --> 00:23:29.074 line:95%,end
<i>You know, I have a daughter</i>
<i>with a broken foot.</i>

00:23:29.141 --> 00:23:30.509 line:95%,end
<i>I have another one</i>
<i>who has a bad back.</i>

00:23:30.575 --> 00:23:33.111 line:95%,end
And I just can't deal
with Leslie right now.

00:23:33.178 --> 00:23:35.781 line:95%,end
HOLLY: She's not supposed
to be dancing. The doctor...

00:23:35.847 --> 00:23:39.050 line:95%,end
I get that. But I'm very confused
after she was in the rehearsal last night.

00:23:39.117 --> 00:23:40.152 line:95%,end
I don't get...

00:23:40.218 --> 00:23:41.520 line:95%,end
Leslie, it's none of your business...

00:23:41.586 --> 00:23:43.155 line:95%,end
-LESLIE: Okay, Kelly.
-...what I do with my kid.

00:23:43.221 --> 00:23:45.290 line:95%,end
LESLIE: You know what,
add that meeting to your list.

00:23:45.357 --> 00:23:46.324 line:95%,end
You need AA meeting.

00:23:46.391 --> 00:23:48.427 line:95%,end
And now you need to go
and see a therapist.

00:23:48.493 --> 00:23:50.495 line:95%,end
So now you got two meetings
that you should be attending.

00:23:50.562 --> 00:23:51.663 line:95%,end
And you're a (bleep) liar.

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:53.331 line:95%,end
Don't spread another lie...

00:23:53.398 --> 00:23:56.101 line:95%,end
Go ask your daughter
if she really pushed my--you lied.

00:23:56.168 --> 00:23:58.970 line:95%,end
No, I didn't. Go get my daughter
and bring her in here.

00:23:59.037 --> 00:23:59.971 line:95%,end
Yeah, and I did...

00:24:00.038 --> 00:24:02.674 line:95%,end
(indistinct chatter)

00:24:04.609 --> 00:24:07.379 line:95%,end
LESLIE: Kelly can never
even elaborate on why

00:24:07.446 --> 00:24:09.247 line:95%,end
Payton supposedly pushed Paige down.

00:24:09.314 --> 00:24:11.183 line:95%,end
It's all lies.
These women are brutal liars.

00:24:11.249 --> 00:24:12.184 line:95%,end
They're liars.

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:13.285 line:95%,end
Let's go get them.

00:24:13.351 --> 00:24:14.486 line:95%,end
You're a liar.

00:24:14.553 --> 00:24:16.988 line:95%,end
(indistinct chatter)

00:24:17.055 --> 00:24:19.825 line:95%,end
I'm not following you.
Bring her right here.

00:24:19.891 --> 00:24:20.826 line:95%,end
Maddie and Paige
are best friends.

00:24:20.892 --> 00:24:22.928 line:95%,end
(indistinct) (bleep).


00:24:26.932 --> 00:24:28.099 line:95%,end
-KELLY: Courtney, can you do me a favor?
-Yeah.

00:24:28.166 --> 00:24:30.135 line:95%,end
Go get Brooke
and tell her to go to my car.

00:24:30.202 --> 00:24:31.269 line:95%,end
Yes.

00:24:31.336 --> 00:24:33.438 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>If Abby wants Leslie</i>
<i>and Payton on this team,</i>

00:24:33.505 --> 00:24:35.340 line:5%,start
then she can have them.

00:24:35.407 --> 00:24:37.342 line:5%,start
But I am not sitting in a dressing room

00:24:37.409 --> 00:24:39.945 line:95%,end
<i>and having somebody</i>
<i>sit and attack me</i>

00:24:40.011 --> 00:24:41.379 line:95%,end
<i>after everything I say.</i>

00:24:41.446 --> 00:24:45.517 line:95%,end
So if Abby wants Payton,
you can have her.

00:24:45.584 --> 00:24:47.986 line:95%,end
And guess what.
They're your friends, aren't they?

00:24:48.053 --> 00:24:49.788 line:95%,end
See where that gets you, too, Melissa.

00:24:49.855 --> 00:24:51.690 line:95%,end
First incident
that I started not to trust you.

00:24:53.358 --> 00:24:54.759 line:95%,end
Kelly, where are you going?

00:24:56.328 --> 00:24:58.129 line:95%,end
LESLIE: I don't have any reason
to sit in this room.

00:24:58.196 --> 00:25:01.500 line:95%,end
And every once in a while,
these women throw their little dig.

00:25:01.566 --> 00:25:03.435 line:95%,end
I'm not going to sit back and take it.

00:25:03.502 --> 00:25:04.903 line:95%,end
MELISSA:
What are you going to do now?

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:06.071 line:95%,end
I'm gonna go home.

00:25:06.137 --> 00:25:06.972 line:95%,end
MELISSA: What about them?

00:25:07.038 --> 00:25:08.039 line:95%,end
I'm not doing it.

00:25:08.106 --> 00:25:09.574 line:95%,end
-What, the recital?
-No.

00:25:09.641 --> 00:25:11.209 line:95%,end
MELISSA: We'll call you after. Okay.

00:25:11.276 --> 00:25:12.911 line:95%,end
Can you please just tell
Brooke to come out?

00:25:12.978 --> 00:25:13.812 line:95%,end
Yes, I'll do it.

00:25:13.879 --> 00:25:15.247 line:95%,end
I don't care.

00:25:15.313 --> 00:25:17.482 line:95%,end
-I'm here just for Payton to dance.
-JILL: Right.

00:25:17.549 --> 00:25:19.251 line:95%,end
So let it go in one ear
and out the other.

00:25:19.317 --> 00:25:20.752 line:95%,end
No. I'm not that kind of person.

00:25:20.819 --> 00:25:22.254 line:95%,end
KELLY:
I don't have a problem with the drama.

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:23.722 line:95%,end
But when Leslie (bleep) lies

00:25:23.788 --> 00:25:25.257 line:95%,end
-every other word out of her mouth...
-MELISSA: Mm-hmm.

00:25:25.323 --> 00:25:26.791 line:95%,end
-...that's when I have a problem.
-MELISSA: She does lie. She does lie.

00:25:26.858 --> 00:25:28.593 line:95%,end
Not one thing she has said has been true.

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:29.528 line:95%,end
I mean, it's over.

00:25:29.594 --> 00:25:31.062 line:95%,end
She is definitely not coming back.

00:25:31.129 --> 00:25:33.298 line:95%,end
I mean, I swear on my mother's grave.

00:25:33.365 --> 00:25:35.600 line:95%,end
Everything that you and I
have said is true.

00:25:35.667 --> 00:25:37.302 line:95%,end
No, that's not--
what are you talking about?

00:25:37.369 --> 00:25:39.638 line:95%,end

without a highland on there

00:25:40.805 --> 00:25:42.407 line:95%,end
and just dance the dance
without reblocking.

00:25:42.474 --> 00:25:44.242 line:95%,end
Like, they can reblock it right on stage.

00:25:44.309 --> 00:25:45.410 line:95%,end
Abby will flip.

00:25:47.045 --> 00:25:48.580 line:95%,end
Okay, I'll miss you, girl.

00:25:48.647 --> 00:25:50.015 line:95%,end
Okay. See ya.

JILL: Abby needs to know,
because this is her show.

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:53.218 line:95%,end
This is her reputation.

-MELISSA: This is her show.

00:25:54.553 --> 00:25:55.754 line:95%,end

<i>She can have the upper hand.</i>

00:26:00.992 --> 00:26:02.060 line:5%,start
She got it.

00:26:02.127 --> 00:26:03.295 line:5%,start
I'll leave. I'm done.

00:26:04.095 --> 00:26:05.497 line:95%,end
We have a really big problem.

00:26:05.564 --> 00:26:07.732 line:95%,end
Kelly and I kind of went at it,
and she quit.

00:26:07.799 --> 00:26:09.301 line:95%,end
And she took all her bags and left.

00:26:09.367 --> 00:26:11.002 line:95%,end
So what are we going to do?

00:26:11.069 --> 00:26:12.604 line:95%,end
<i>If Kelly has a tantrum,</i>

00:26:12.671 --> 00:26:14.339 line:95%,end

00:26:14.406 --> 00:26:17.609 line:5%,start
and honor her children's contracts.

00:26:17.676 --> 00:26:20.178 line:95%,end
They were to be there

annual dance concert.

00:26:39.064 --> 00:26:40.765 line:95%,end

Oh, my.

Here's a little punch for you.

00:26:52.077 --> 00:26:53.011 line:95%,end
I can't.

Thank you.

00:27:11.062 --> 00:27:11.896 line:95%,end
We had fun.

After the week we've had,

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:18.003 line:95%,end

a night to let loose.

ABBY: Brooke, get over here.
I want to talk to you for a second.

00:28:06.785 --> 00:28:09.587 line:95%,end
I went to rehearse,
and you weren't around yesterday.

00:28:09.654 --> 00:28:11.756 line:95%,end
Brooke needed to be here to run the cues.

00:28:11.823 --> 00:28:13.525 line:95%,end
You can't let that happen again.

00:28:13.591 --> 00:28:15.260 line:95%,end
If your mom gets in a fight with somebody

00:28:15.326 --> 00:28:17.762 line:95%,end

you need to say,

00:28:17.829 --> 00:28:20.598 line:95%,end
let me stay for the rest of the time
and Dad can come pick me up.

00:28:20.665 --> 00:28:23.702 line:95%,end
I wasn't going to come today,
and this is why I'm here.

00:28:23.768 --> 00:28:25.603 line:95%,end
I didn't even think.
I just left.

00:28:27.072 --> 00:28:28.673 line:95%,end
It's very, very important

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:30.809 line:95%,end
that you be on the money today.

00:28:30.875 --> 00:28:34.779 line:95%,end
Every dance aficionado in Pittsburgh

00:28:34.846 --> 00:28:37.782 line:95%,end
So it's imperative that
you step out there

00:28:37.849 --> 00:28:39.050 line:95%,end

Rhonda, you have your notepad.

I'm not expecting any type of real theme.

I'm not expecting anything that
is, I guess, Broadway style.

I'm just expecting to see
a recital or concert.

There's a ton of colleagues
that are dance teachers

that I'm sure are snooping around
and looking for ideas.

00:29:56.861 --> 00:29:59.497 line:95%,end
So let's make sure that we get out there

00:29:59.564 --> 00:30:01.065 line:95%,end

Yes.

You have to hit it hard.

What's the matter, Kendall?

00:32:47.398 --> 00:32:48.466 line:95%,end
I need to get ready.

JILL: Settle down.

00:32:51.202 --> 00:32:53.271 line:95%,end
I know you're tired.
We're all tired, sweetheart.

00:32:53.338 --> 00:32:56.140 line:95%,end
I know.
And it's important to you.

00:32:56.207 --> 00:32:57.475 line:95%,end
JILL:
Why are you ripping your hair?

00:32:57.542 --> 00:32:59.277 line:95%,end
Because I hate you right now.

00:32:59.344 --> 00:33:00.511 line:95%,end
JILL: Oh, sweetie. It's okay.

00:33:00.578 --> 00:33:01.713 line:95%,end
I need to get dressed.

00:33:01.779 --> 00:33:02.680 line:95%,end

Chloe getting the featured role
in "Trapped" this week

00:33:12.991 --> 00:33:14.392 line:5%,start
is kind of a catch-22.

00:33:14.459 --> 00:33:17.295 line:5%,start
I'm thrilled that she is finally
getting this amazing role

00:33:17.362 --> 00:33:18.363 line:95%,end
<i>in a great dance.</i>

00:33:18.429 --> 00:33:19.464 line:95%,end
<i>But on the other hand,</i>

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:21.532 line:95%,end
<i>Maddie has already performed this role.</i>

00:33:21.599 --> 00:33:23.935 line:95%,end
And so Chloe is always going
to be compared to Maddie.

00:33:24.002 --> 00:33:25.670 line:95%,end
So if anything goes wrong,

00:33:25.737 --> 00:33:28.740 line:95%,end
Abby is going to throw it back in her face
like, "Mm, Maddie was better."

rolls over Brooke's back,

up to the beautiful arch,
holds it, then down.

00:34:11.849 --> 00:34:14.585 line:5%,start
I gave her a correction,

Let's go.

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:51.355 line:95%,end
Candy Apple's dance recital is top notch.

00:34:51.422 --> 00:34:55.359 line:5%,start
And Abby's recital is nothing
to the degree of our recital.

Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

It was great.
They did a great job.

00:35:07.138 --> 00:35:09.307 line:95%,end
They were outstanding

Jill, you know, you tried the whole
gift thing with Abby before.

I mean, Abby has amazing kids.

And she's an amazing choreographer.

00:36:29.086 --> 00:36:31.389 line:95%,end
She knows how to put a show together.
That's for sure.

Our junior winner is
Miss Maddie Ziegler.

<i>This--this is wonderful for her.</i>

00:37:21.739 --> 00:37:23.774 line:95%,end
<i>This is a moment we have</i>

out on the veranda.

00:37:43.127 --> 00:37:46.097 line:95%,end
And this is a highlight
of the dance concert.

00:37:47.164 --> 00:37:49.100 line:5%,start
Hey, how you doing?

00:37:50.167 --> 00:37:53.571 line:5%,start
I was very nervous about
meeting with these alumni.

00:37:53.638 --> 00:37:56.507 line:5%,start
I thought, "Oh God, I'm not even
going to recognize them."

00:37:56.574 --> 00:37:59.110 line:95%,end
<i>You know, but I really</i>

00:37:59.176 --> 00:38:00.378 line:95%,end

You were here last year, too.

Abby, I need to know,

00:38:01.646 --> 00:38:04.682 line:95%,end
did the alumni talk
any bad stuff on me?

00:38:04.749 --> 00:38:06.350 line:95%,end
I haven't talked to the alumni yet.

Had it been under different
circumstances,

00:38:09.553 --> 00:38:13.024 line:95%,end
I'm sure that every one of those alumni

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:15.192 line:95%,end
would have had a story about Kelly

00:38:15.259 --> 00:38:16.794 line:95%,end
and how much they hate her.

00:38:16.861 --> 00:38:18.329 line:95%,end
Was Kelly ever late?

00:38:18.396 --> 00:38:19.864 line:95%,end
ALL: Yes!

00:38:19.930 --> 00:38:21.632 line:95%,end
Did Kelly ever not show up?

00:38:21.699 --> 00:38:22.700 line:95%,end
ALL: Yes!

00:38:22.767 --> 00:38:24.468 line:95%,end
Was Kelly naked all the time?

00:38:24.535 --> 00:38:25.436 line:95%,end
ALL: Yes!

Nice to meet you, sweetie.

00:38:41.252 --> 00:38:43.621 line:95%,end
We're looking for a new
studio to compete.

00:38:43.688 --> 00:38:45.222 line:95%,end
-Where are you from?
-St. Louis.

00:38:45.289 --> 00:38:46.190 line:95%,end
St. Louis?

00:38:46.257 --> 00:38:49.226 line:95%,end
KAYA: I think Nicaya has something
to offer your team.

00:38:49.293 --> 00:38:51.996 line:95%,end
Okay. We're having a little
workshop in the studio.

00:38:52.063 --> 00:38:54.031 line:95%,end
-Mm-hmm.
-So why don't you come?

00:38:54.665 --> 00:38:56.667 line:95%,end
You can come take a little
tour of the studio,

00:38:56.734 --> 00:38:59.036 line:95%,end
and she can take class,
and I can observe her during class.

00:38:59.103 --> 00:39:01.072 line:95%,end
So do you have room
on your competition team?

00:39:01.138 --> 00:39:02.373 line:95%,end
I always have room.

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:03.641 line:95%,end
There's never enough students.

00:39:03.708 --> 00:39:05.509 line:95%,end
It's been an outstanding show.

00:39:05.976 --> 00:39:10.514 line:95%,end
And now I want to sit back and relax
and enjoy my evening,

00:39:10.581 --> 00:39:15.953 line:95%,end
when all of a sudden
I hear this agitating grating voice.

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:17.955 line:95%,end
We, you know, groom you

00:39:18.022 --> 00:39:19.957 line:95%,end
into becoming part
of our competition team.

00:39:20.024 --> 00:39:22.760 line:95%,end
I'm footing the bill for this,
and she was not invited.

00:39:22.827 --> 00:39:27.031 line:95%,end
All I know is she has no
business being anywhere

00:39:27.098 --> 00:39:28.366 line:95%,end
near my customers.

00:39:28.432 --> 00:39:30.668 line:95%,end
Technically her dancers were amazing.

00:39:30.735 --> 00:39:32.470 line:95%,end
But did you feel that, like,

00:39:32.536 --> 00:39:34.372 line:95%,end
the steps were somewhat limited?

00:39:34.438 --> 00:39:36.707 line:95%,end
Like, not a whole lot of choreography
going on?

00:39:36.774 --> 00:39:38.042 line:95%,end
You know what, I need to tell you,

00:39:38.109 --> 00:39:40.578 line:95%,end
you sound like you would
make a dandy Apple.

00:39:40.644 --> 00:39:42.246 line:95%,end
-Yeah, she would.
-(laughter)

00:39:42.313 --> 00:39:44.081 line:95%,end
We're a little wilted

00:39:44.148 --> 00:39:46.984 line:95%,end
because there wasn't a whole
lot of air conditioning--

00:39:47.051 --> 00:39:48.486 line:95%,end
There was air conditioning.

00:39:48.552 --> 00:39:50.454 line:95%,end
There was just a lot of hot air.

00:39:50.521 --> 00:39:51.722 line:95%,end
(laughter)

00:39:51.789 --> 00:39:55.960 line:95%,end
Thank you so much for having us
invited to this lovely show.

00:39:56.026 --> 00:39:57.595 line:95%,end
-I didn't know you were invited.
-I have--

00:39:57.661 --> 00:39:59.029 line:95%,end
Yes, you invited us.

00:39:59.096 --> 00:40:00.798 line:95%,end
We got tickets from you.

00:40:00.865 --> 00:40:01.899 line:95%,end
Not from me.

00:40:01.966 --> 00:40:03.501 line:95%,end
How did she get here?

00:40:03.567 --> 00:40:04.869 line:95%,end
I don't see a broom in sight.

00:40:04.935 --> 00:40:05.903 line:95%,end
No backdrops.

00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:07.538 line:95%,end
-Black curtain.

because I wanted her to see
how Kendall fits in

00:40:28.192 --> 00:40:29.193 line:5%,start
with this team.

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:31.796 line:5%,start
-Oh, Jill invited you.

To steal your music?
