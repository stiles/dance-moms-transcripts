Oh, my God.

00:00:03.036 --> 00:00:04.504 line:95%,end
It will all come together.

00:00:04.571 --> 00:00:06.539 line:95%,end
JEFF: <i>Part two of our</i>
Dance Moms <i>reunion.</i>

00:00:06.606 --> 00:00:07.807 line:95%,end
It's okay to be competitive.

00:00:07.874 --> 00:00:09.009 line:95%,end
I am very competitive.

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:10.543 line:95%,end
Jill, I think it's time
for you to shut up.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.546 line:95%,end
-That's rude.
-I will do whatever my kids want to do.

00:00:13.613 --> 00:00:14.781 line:95%,end
I think that's sick.

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:16.549 line:95%,end
-I kept hearing the (bleep).
-Let her talk. Let her talk.

00:00:16.616 --> 00:00:17.717 line:95%,end
I thought I was gonna have to fight.

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:20.620 line:95%,end
It seems like there's a lot of tension.

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:22.088 line:95%,end
What's on your necklace?

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:24.457 line:95%,end
They're all the mothers
that didn't listen.

00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:28.228 line:95%,end
The women of <i>Dance Moms</i>
reunite right here.

00:00:28.294 --> 00:00:29.529 line:95%,end
(gasps)

00:00:29.596 --> 00:00:32.098 line:95%,end
It's always a pleasure
to be amongst this group.

00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:33.066 line:95%,end

SINGER:
<i>âª Living on the dance floor âª</i>

00:00:36.503 --> 00:00:37.404 line:95%,end
Hi, everybody.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.073 line:95%,end
Welcome to part two
of <i>Dance Moms,</i> the reunion.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.642 line:5%,start
I'm Jeff Collins,
the executive producer of the show.

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:44.911 line:5%,start
And we're here with the women
who make the show

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:48.148 line:95%,end
so riveting to watch,
Melissa Gisoni,

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:50.950 line:95%,end
Dr. Holly Frazier, Christi Lukasiak,

00:00:51.017 --> 00:00:53.686 line:95%,end
Kelly Hyland, and Jill Vertes.

00:00:53.753 --> 00:00:54.888 line:95%,end
Hi, Jeff.

00:00:54.954 --> 00:00:56.923 line:95%,end
And of course,
the fabulous Abby Miller.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.391 line:95%,end
-Thank you.
-JEFF: So good to have you.

00:00:58.458 --> 00:01:01.394 line:95%,end
Joining us this hour is the owner
of Candy Apples Dance Studio

00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:03.863 line:95%,end
in Canton, Ohio, Cathy Nesbitt-Stein.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.699 line:95%,end
It's always a pleasure
to be amongst this group.

00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:09.502 line:95%,end
All right, so, ladies,
let's get right to it.

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:11.071 line:95%,end
Cathy, we all know
that there's nothing

00:01:11.137 --> 00:01:13.139 line:95%,end
you love more than being
at the center of attention,

00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:17.110 line:95%,end
especially when you chose
to choreograph a special mother's dance

00:01:17.177 --> 00:01:20.447 line:95%,end
that didn't exactly go
the way everyone had planned.

00:01:21.047 --> 00:01:22.182 line:95%,end
Let's take a look at this.

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:25.118 line:95%,end
(applause)

00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:27.253 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.823 line:95%,end
SINGER: <i>âª That lass has class âª</i>

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:32.258 line:95%,end
<i>âª This chick is hip âª</i>

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.564 line:95%,end
<i>âª And if she takes you on her ride,</i>
<i>it's a real crazy time âª</i>

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.199 line:95%,end
Oh, my God.

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:42.202 line:95%,end
SINGER: <i>âª Those lips, those hips âª</i>

00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:44.904 line:95%,end
<i>âª Beyond compare âª</i>

00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:48.842 line:95%,end
<i>âª That sway so gently as they twist âª</i>

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.046 line:95%,end
<i>âª The moment that she... âª</i>

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:54.914 line:95%,end
KELLY: What is she doing?
What is she doing?

00:01:56.216 --> 00:01:58.084 line:95%,end
Look at Kelly's eyes.

00:01:58.151 --> 00:01:59.652 line:95%,end
She changed the dance.

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:01.287 line:95%,end
She changed the dance.

00:02:01.354 --> 00:02:03.089 line:95%,end
CATHY: <i>I pretty much</i>
<i>took center stage.</i>

00:02:03.156 --> 00:02:05.992 line:95%,end
<i>And I improvised.</i>

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:09.462 line:95%,end
<i>But I think that the moms</i>
<i>probably should have expected</i>

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:11.364 line:95%,end
<i>that being a dance teacher,</i>

00:02:11.431 --> 00:02:14.267 line:95%,end
I was going to put some
of my own thing into it to jazz it up.

00:02:14.334 --> 00:02:16.369 line:95%,end
They should have expected that.
And if they didn't,

00:02:16.436 --> 00:02:17.937 line:95%,end
then they got caught
with their pants down.

00:02:18.004 --> 00:02:20.640 line:95%,end
CATHY:
She's doing a solo out there.

00:02:20.707 --> 00:02:22.208 line:95%,end
What is she doing?

00:02:22.275 --> 00:02:26.513 line:95%,end
SINGER: <i>âª Gotta be kissed âª</i>

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.414 line:95%,end
<i>âª Oh, yeah âª</i>

00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:31.451 line:95%,end
<i>-âª She's gotta be kissed! âª</i>
-(bleep).

00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:33.353 line:95%,end
SINGER:
<i>âª Make no mistake about it âª</i>

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.156 line:95%,end
<i>âª That chick's sure gettin' kissed âª</i>

00:02:37.123 --> 00:02:39.359 line:95%,end
(applause)

00:02:41.728 --> 00:02:45.465 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Cathy was in her little,
like, Candy Apple heaven.

00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:49.936 line:95%,end
I'm gonna kick her ass.

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:52.639 line:95%,end
(laughter)

00:02:52.705 --> 00:02:54.440 line:95%,end
All right, you got
to give it up for Cathy.

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:55.875 line:95%,end
She certainly stole the spotlight.

00:02:55.942 --> 00:02:57.210 line:95%,end
Did you plan that?

00:02:57.277 --> 00:02:58.344 line:95%,end
Did you know exactly
what you were doing?

00:02:58.411 --> 00:03:00.180 line:95%,end
You know,
I had to do something.

00:03:00.246 --> 00:03:03.349 line:95%,end
I was working with people that
just were totally inept

00:03:03.416 --> 00:03:04.317 line:95%,end
when it came to dance.

00:03:04.384 --> 00:03:07.420 line:95%,end
I was trying to give
grunge a taste to Melissa.

00:03:07.487 --> 00:03:10.957 line:95%,end
I was trying--well, Christi could only do
just a little hands jazz thing.

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:13.560 line:95%,end
I had to pull it together.
I mean, this was Abby's recital.

00:03:13.626 --> 00:03:16.162 line:95%,end
I didn't want it to flop for Abby, so--

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:17.130 line:95%,end
Whoa, wait a minute.

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:19.532 line:95%,end
See, Cathy, that's just it.

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.367 line:95%,end
That's bad choreography.

00:03:21.434 --> 00:03:22.936 line:95%,end
That was a bad idea.

00:03:23.002 --> 00:03:24.170 line:95%,end
It's a mom's dance.

00:03:24.237 --> 00:03:25.805 line:95%,end
You use a novelty.

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:27.740 line:95%,end
You make the maids
like Carol Burnett.

00:03:27.807 --> 00:03:29.676 line:95%,end
You go out there,
you do something fun.

00:03:29.742 --> 00:03:32.712 line:95%,end
You don't make people
that don't dance for a living

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:34.214 line:95%,end
go out there and mortify themselves.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.383 line:95%,end
Christi over here
was a little rah-rah pom pom girl.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.521 line:95%,end
And Kelly--well,
we all know Kelly was from you.

00:03:41.588 --> 00:03:45.024 line:95%,end
So I would have expected Kelly
to be able to just hop


00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:47.760 line:95%,end
-right on something--
-Kelly hasn't danced in 20 years.

00:03:47.827 --> 00:03:49.195 line:95%,end
JILL:
If you were a good choreographer,

00:03:49.262 --> 00:03:51.297 line:95%,end
-you would have seen--
-Jill, you weren't even in the dance.

00:03:51.364 --> 00:03:52.899 line:95%,end
-JILL: I know. I just saw it.
-I know.

00:03:52.966 --> 00:03:54.367 line:95%,end
I was given a criteria.

00:03:54.434 --> 00:03:55.902 line:95%,end
And I also had to come up
with costumes.

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:58.271 line:95%,end
And you know,
with what I had to deal with--

00:03:58.338 --> 00:04:00.940 line:95%,end
You had 40-year-old women
in stirrup tights.

00:04:01.007 --> 00:04:02.575 line:95%,end
-CATHY: Here's the thing, though, Abby--
-You could have put them in heels.

00:04:02.642 --> 00:04:03.509 line:95%,end
CATHY: Here's the thing.

00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:04.611 line:95%,end
You could have done
a little novelty number...

00:04:04.677 --> 00:04:06.312 line:95%,end
-CATHY: Abby, but here's the thing.
-...a little lingerie thing.

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:08.181 line:95%,end
Abby, I'm trying to do
something cutting edge

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:09.782 line:95%,end
and give them cute, stylish costumes...

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:10.917 line:95%,end
Cutting edge?

00:04:10.984 --> 00:04:12.585 line:95%,end
-...that are kind of--kind of cabaret...
-CHRISTI: They were not cute and stylish.

00:04:12.652 --> 00:04:14.454 line:95%,end
-CATHY: ...looking...
-Do a jazz--you wear--cabaret,

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.622 line:95%,end
you should have had heels.

00:04:15.688 --> 00:04:17.423 line:95%,end
-Well, Abby...
-ABBY: Cabaret.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.158 line:95%,end
-...we wanted--we wanted the moms...
-ABBY: Fosse, we get it.

00:04:19.225 --> 00:04:20.960 line:95%,end
...we wanted the moms
to be able to dance.

00:04:21.027 --> 00:04:22.996 line:95%,end
We didn't want them
to be toppling off stage,

00:04:23.062 --> 00:04:26.499 line:95%,end
which is exactly what you would have
loved to see happen with them.

00:04:26.566 --> 00:04:28.101 line:95%,end
No, I just wanted them
to entertain the audience

00:04:28.167 --> 00:04:29.702 line:95%,end
-and have a good time up there.
-ABBY: Well, and that we did.

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:31.904 line:95%,end
JEFF: Abby, you--you said--
you said that this dance

00:04:31.971 --> 00:04:33.539 line:95%,end
should never have seen
the light of day.

00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:35.241 line:95%,end
-Correct.
-JEFF: What--what--how--

00:04:35.308 --> 00:04:37.110 line:95%,end
what do you give Cathy for--
if you were scoring Cathy,

00:04:37.176 --> 00:04:38.378 line:95%,end
what would you give Cathy
as a score

00:04:38.444 --> 00:04:39.846 line:95%,end
for choreographing that dance?

00:04:42.548 --> 00:04:44.217 line:95%,end
70 out of 100.

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:45.418 line:95%,end
-HOLLY: That's pretty good.
-ABBY: No.

00:04:45.485 --> 00:04:46.552 line:95%,end
Well, that's probably--
what, is that a high goal?

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:47.920 line:95%,end
That's, like, not even bronze, no.

00:04:47.987 --> 00:04:50.056 line:95%,end
So Cathy, the Candy Apple dancers

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:52.358 line:95%,end
have only beat Abby's group once...

00:04:52.425 --> 00:04:54.093 line:95%,end
-Right.
-JEFF: ...by 1/10 of a point.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.728 line:95%,end
-Correct.
-JEFF: So how does that feel?

00:04:56.462 --> 00:04:59.365 line:95%,end
We have seen Abby earlier on

00:04:59.432 --> 00:05:01.834 line:95%,end
in years that we have beat her.

00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:02.802 line:95%,end
She knows it.

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:03.870 line:95%,end
<i>I know it.</i>

00:05:03.936 --> 00:05:06.105 line:95%,end
<i>So it's a little frustrating.</i>

00:05:06.172 --> 00:05:09.242 line:95%,end
<i>But I would rather look</i>
<i>upon our rivalry</i>

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:13.146 line:95%,end
as good healthy competition
than it a vindictive thing.

00:05:13.212 --> 00:05:14.614 line:95%,end
So could it be that
she's just better than you?

00:05:15.948 --> 00:05:16.983 line:95%,end
Hmm.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.551 line:95%,end
I don't know that Abby's better than me.

00:05:18.618 --> 00:05:21.788 line:95%,end
I think what Abby's girls have
is star quality, to be honest.

00:05:21.854 --> 00:05:23.556 line:95%,end
I think that that's what her girls have

00:05:23.623 --> 00:05:26.459 line:95%,end
that we might have to continue
to work on for a while.

00:05:26.526 --> 00:05:29.762 line:95%,end
So Cathy, when Jill came back
to Abby Lee...

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:31.030 line:95%,end
Hi, everyone.

00:05:31.497 --> 00:05:33.633 line:95%,end
Abby, can I talk to you?

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.168 line:95%,end
I'm right in the middle
of the pyramid.

00:05:35.234 --> 00:05:36.569 line:95%,end
You know how this works.

00:05:36.636 --> 00:05:38.471 line:95%,end
I made a mistake
going to Candy Apples.

00:05:38.538 --> 00:05:39.672 line:95%,end
You guys know that.

00:05:39.739 --> 00:05:41.374 line:95%,end
It--it was a mistake.

00:05:41.441 --> 00:05:42.875 line:95%,end
...how did that make you feel?

00:05:42.942 --> 00:05:45.511 line:95%,end
I wasn't really sad to see Jill go.

00:05:45.578 --> 00:05:47.613 line:95%,end
-Sorry, Jill.
-Newsflash.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.016 line:95%,end
-CATHY: Sorry, Jill.
-Oh, please, like I didn't know.

00:05:51.617 --> 00:05:53.519 line:95%,end
You know, she came in,

00:05:53.586 --> 00:05:56.022 line:95%,end
and it was fun at first.

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:58.858 line:95%,end
Yeah, this is great
because we've got

00:05:58.925 --> 00:06:00.860 line:95%,end
one of Abby's castoffs.

00:06:00.927 --> 00:06:03.363 line:95%,end
And it's going to be
a little bit of fun to maybe

00:06:03.429 --> 00:06:05.765 line:95%,end
rib Abby about it a little bit.

00:06:05.832 --> 00:06:07.367 line:95%,end
You welcomed us.
You said, absolutely...

00:06:07.433 --> 00:06:09.702 line:95%,end
-I did welcome you.
-...I have a place for Kendall.

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:11.337 line:95%,end
-CATHY: He didn't ask me...
-She's talented.

00:06:11.404 --> 00:06:12.405 line:95%,end
She has potential.

00:06:12.472 --> 00:06:15.641 line:95%,end
...he didn't ask me about how I felt
when you came through the door.

00:06:15.708 --> 00:06:16.776 line:95%,end
He asked me how I felt...

00:06:16.843 --> 00:06:18.077 line:95%,end
-JILL: But you were saying...
-...when the door hit you...

00:06:18.144 --> 00:06:19.445 line:95%,end
-JILL: ...she came--she came...
-...in the butt on the way out.

00:06:19.512 --> 00:06:21.848 line:95%,end
...she came in, and she didn't fit in.
But that's not what you said.

00:06:21.914 --> 00:06:23.549 line:95%,end
You said, I have great plans
for Kendall.

00:06:23.616 --> 00:06:26.152 line:95%,end
-Jill, he asked me how I felt--
-JILL: And I believed you, Cathy.

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:27.453 line:95%,end
Listen, Barbie,

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.223 line:95%,end
-he asked me how I felt...
-ABBY: That's a compliment. Say thank you.

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:31.958 line:95%,end
-...when you left.
-JILL: Shut up.

00:06:32.024 --> 00:06:34.494 line:95%,end
And I wasn't really saddened
to see you go.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.462 line:95%,end
I was actually rather happy
to see you go because you...

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:38.464 line:95%,end
-That's rude. You're rude.
-CATHY: ...whined too much.

00:06:38.531 --> 00:06:39.799 line:95%,end
You know that.

00:06:39.866 --> 00:06:40.867 line:95%,end
She whines too much.

00:06:40.933 --> 00:06:43.870 line:95%,end
Lucky for you,
you got a little siete out of it.

00:06:43.936 --> 00:06:46.105 line:95%,end
And you got a nice little
back massage out of it.

00:06:46.172 --> 00:06:47.407 line:95%,end
You didn't bring me any gifts.

00:06:47.473 --> 00:06:50.042 line:95%,end
My kids know that they come in,

00:06:50.109 --> 00:06:51.277 line:95%,end
they get the correction.

00:06:51.344 --> 00:06:52.345 line:95%,end
They leave.

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:53.846 line:95%,end
They come back, I better see the...

00:06:53.913 --> 00:06:55.481 line:95%,end
-JILL: You know what?
-...next time.

00:06:55.548 --> 00:06:56.983 line:95%,end
I didn't see that with Kendall.

00:06:57.049 --> 00:06:58.117 line:95%,end
And it just didn't work.

00:06:58.184 --> 00:06:59.986 line:95%,end
It just didn't work.
So I really wasn't that sad.

00:07:00.052 --> 00:07:01.187 line:95%,end
Did I say I didn't like you?

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:02.722 line:95%,end
No, I didn't say I didn't like you.

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:03.923 line:95%,end
I just said I didn't really--

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.159 line:95%,end
it--it didn't really bother me
that you left.

00:07:06.225 --> 00:07:08.995 line:95%,end
But you hurt me very badly.

00:07:09.061 --> 00:07:10.396 line:95%,end
And you broke Kendall's heart.

00:07:10.463 --> 00:07:11.764 line:95%,end
Jill, I think that
you're over the edge.

00:07:11.831 --> 00:07:13.332 line:95%,end
I think it's time for you to shut up.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.501 line:95%,end
That's rude.

00:07:15.568 --> 00:07:16.469 line:95%,end
All right, well--

00:07:16.536 --> 00:07:18.471 line:95%,end
I don't think that
we were disputing that one iota.

00:07:18.538 --> 00:07:20.773 line:95%,end
All right, so beating Abby
at a dance competition

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.675 line:95%,end
has always been Cathy's mission.

00:07:22.742 --> 00:07:25.912 line:95%,end
So when Candy Apples seemed
to play fast and loose

00:07:25.978 --> 00:07:27.146 line:95%,end
with the rules,

00:07:27.213 --> 00:07:29.348 line:95%,end
was Cathy just being determined,

00:07:29.415 --> 00:07:31.117 line:95%,end
or was it simply cheating?


00:07:31.184 --> 00:07:32.251 line:95%,end
Take a look at this.

00:07:32.318 --> 00:07:34.420 line:95%,end
MELISSA: She doesn't seem like
she was from Cathy's studio at all.

00:07:34.487 --> 00:07:35.455 line:95%,end
Exactly.

00:07:35.521 --> 00:07:37.523 line:95%,end
-She's at least 50.
-Yeah.

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:39.091 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: There's no way
that kid is 11, 12.

00:07:39.158 --> 00:07:40.326 line:95%,end
I don't think so, either.

00:07:41.027 --> 00:07:42.028 line:95%,end
CATHY: Hello.

00:07:42.094 --> 00:07:44.897 line:95%,end
I was just wondering if we could talk
to Cathy and Erika's mom.

00:07:44.964 --> 00:07:46.232 line:95%,end
CATHY: Sure.

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:48.234 line:95%,end
-If you guys would come upstairs with me.
-CATHY: Mm-hmm.

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:49.936 line:95%,end
We've got a lot of people questioning--

00:07:50.002 --> 00:07:51.037 line:95%,end
-Yeah.
-Erika.

00:07:51.103 --> 00:07:52.071 line:95%,end
-Yeah.
-Yes.

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:52.972 line:95%,end
-Erika's age.
-Yeah.

00:07:53.039 --> 00:07:56.008 line:95%,end
We have people complaining
that they have seen her perform

00:07:56.642 --> 00:07:59.579 line:95%,end
in the 14 age division
at other competitions.

00:07:59.645 --> 00:08:01.681 line:95%,end
CATHY: Okay,
so I don't have birth certificates.

00:08:01.747 --> 00:08:02.949 line:95%,end
I didn't have to have birth certificates
at the last--

00:08:03.015 --> 00:08:03.950 line:95%,end
Let me ask you a question.

00:08:04.016 --> 00:08:05.885 line:95%,end
How old is Erika
and her date of birth?

00:08:05.952 --> 00:08:07.820 line:95%,end
-Erika is 14.
-WOMAN: Correct.

00:08:07.887 --> 00:08:10.156 line:95%,end
January 17, 1997.

00:08:10.223 --> 00:08:12.725 line:95%,end
-So '97, she's 13, 14 then.
-CATHY: Yeah.

00:08:12.792 --> 00:08:14.794 line:95%,end
All right,
she is in the wrong age division.

00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:15.862 line:95%,end
And so is Brooke.

00:08:15.928 --> 00:08:17.997 line:95%,end
Okay, I'll take that up
in a minute with Abby.

00:08:18.064 --> 00:08:19.198 line:95%,end
We definitely need to take that up.

00:08:19.265 --> 00:08:20.266 line:95%,end
-WOMAN: Okay, I will.
-Okay?

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:21.267 line:95%,end
WOMAN: I promise you I will.

00:08:21.934 --> 00:08:24.570 line:95%,end
I happen to have in my hand

00:08:24.637 --> 00:08:26.038 line:95%,end
your solo music,

00:08:26.105 --> 00:08:27.773 line:95%,end
which is gorgeous.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.542 line:95%,end
But I also happen to know

00:08:29.609 --> 00:08:33.179 line:95%,end
that it's the same solo music
that Chloe is using.

00:08:33.246 --> 00:08:35.181 line:95%,end
It's no secret
that you can go online

00:08:35.248 --> 00:08:37.884 line:95%,end
and find out what the songs are

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:40.186 line:95%,end
that the contestants are dancing to.

00:08:40.253 --> 00:08:43.256 line:95%,end
So I chose Chloe's song for Taylor

00:08:43.322 --> 00:08:44.891 line:95%,end
<i>just to psych them out.</i>

00:08:44.957 --> 00:08:46.359 line:95%,end
<i>When I show up in Hollywood,</i>

00:08:46.425 --> 00:08:48.995 line:95%,end
<i>that Abby Lee Miller</i>
<i>is not going to know what hit her.</i>

00:08:49.061 --> 00:08:50.496 line:95%,end
(tense music playing)

00:08:50.563 --> 00:08:51.998 line:95%,end
Is that Chloe's music?

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:54.400 line:95%,end
Same song.

00:08:56.836 --> 00:08:58.037 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: That's your music.

00:08:59.438 --> 00:09:01.574 line:95%,end
CATHY:
You know, we have beat Abby before.

00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:04.010 line:95%,end
And statistics are for losers.

00:09:04.076 --> 00:09:07.346 line:95%,end
So it doesn't matter
whether it's by a tenth of a point.

00:09:07.413 --> 00:09:09.649 line:95%,end
It doesn't matter
whether it's ninth place,

00:09:09.715 --> 00:09:10.883 line:95%,end
or 10th place, or whatever.

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:12.285 line:95%,end
We have beat Abby before.

00:09:12.351 --> 00:09:16.322 line:95%,end
Just remember,
my children are nine,

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:19.592 line:95%,end
10, 11, one 14-year-old.

00:09:19.659 --> 00:09:22.395 line:95%,end
She has 15 and 16-year-olds
on her team.

00:09:22.461 --> 00:09:24.864 line:95%,end
-But Abby--
-ABBY: The skill set for 16-year-old

00:09:24.931 --> 00:09:26.499 line:95%,end
better be more difficult

00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:28.134 line:95%,end
than the skill set for a nine-year-old.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.637 line:95%,end
Abby, why do competitions
let you average ages?

00:09:31.704 --> 00:09:35.441 line:95%,end
You can't put a 16-year-old in
with Vivian anymore.

00:09:35.508 --> 00:09:36.876 line:95%,end
-There are--
-ABBY: They can only drop down

00:09:36.943 --> 00:09:39.245 line:95%,end
-one age level.
-There are competitions that do that.

00:09:39.312 --> 00:09:40.212 line:95%,end
You are right.

00:09:40.279 --> 00:09:42.014 line:95%,end
They're trying to stop teachers like you
from doing that.

00:09:42.081 --> 00:09:44.784 line:95%,end
We, as dance teachers,
have all average ages.

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:47.186 line:95%,end
-ABBY: Absolutely.
-You have as well as I have.

00:09:47.253 --> 00:09:49.622 line:95%,end
When you're doing a production number,
a line, a large group,

00:09:49.689 --> 00:09:51.023 line:95%,end
-that comes into play.
-CATHY: Okay.

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:52.425 line:95%,end
-ABBY: Right.
-CATHY: You fail to understand

00:09:52.491 --> 00:09:54.594 line:95%,end
that Taylor may look older,

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:56.529 line:95%,end
but she is 11.

00:09:56.596 --> 00:09:58.664 line:95%,end
I don't fail to understand that. I know.

00:09:58.731 --> 00:10:00.132 line:95%,end
-CATHY: But Taylor's always--
-I see 11-year-old feet

00:10:00.199 --> 00:10:01.867 line:95%,end
and 11-year-old knees. I get it.

00:10:01.934 --> 00:10:03.603 line:95%,end
Taylor is always being targeted

00:10:03.669 --> 00:10:05.705 line:95%,end
that she's one of the bigger kids
and, you know,

00:10:05.771 --> 00:10:07.673 line:95%,end
turning around and asking us
what--you know,

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.442 line:95%,end
what do those kids eat
and all of that kind of--

00:10:09.508 --> 00:10:11.777 line:95%,end
-those girls are big.
-Okay, Cathy, I get all that.

00:10:11.844 --> 00:10:13.546 line:95%,end
I understand it.
When those kids go into an audition...

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:15.281 line:95%,end
Why does it bother you so badly?

00:10:15.348 --> 00:10:17.683 line:95%,end
-ABBY: ...they're going to be cast...
-We're not talking about auditions.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:19.018 line:95%,end
ABBY: ...the way they look...

00:10:19.085 --> 00:10:20.286 line:95%,end
CATHY: We are not talking
about auditions.

00:10:20.353 --> 00:10:21.354 line:95%,end
...regardless of what
their birth certificate says.

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:23.289 line:95%,end
Abby, you don't need to bring
everything back to Broadway.

00:10:23.356 --> 00:10:24.557 line:95%,end
We're not talking about auditions.

00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:26.892 line:95%,end
Why does it bother you so badly

00:10:26.959 --> 00:10:28.661 line:95%,end
what my team configures?

00:10:28.728 --> 00:10:30.896 line:95%,end
That's not my problem.
That's your problem.

00:10:30.963 --> 00:10:33.699 line:95%,end
All right, Cathy, here's another question
for you from a viewer.

00:10:33.766 --> 00:10:37.103 line:95%,end
This is Eddie from Tustin, California,
who wonders, Cathy,

00:10:37.169 --> 00:10:40.406 line:95%,end
why bring in outside choreographers
to work with your girls?

00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:42.308 line:95%,end
Do you think your skills
aren't good enough

00:10:42.375 --> 00:10:43.876 line:95%,end
to stand up to Abby?

00:10:43.943 --> 00:10:47.113 line:95%,end
Everybody brings in
outside choreographers, everybody.

00:10:47.179 --> 00:10:49.315 line:95%,end
Abby has had
outside choreographers. Okay.

00:10:49.382 --> 00:10:50.883 line:95%,end
Oh, I've had lots of them,
and I love them.

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:52.718 line:95%,end
-Let her talk. Let her talk.
-CATHY: If you can afford them

00:10:52.785 --> 00:10:55.187 line:95%,end
and your parents are cooperative,

00:10:55.254 --> 00:10:57.089 line:95%,end
then you can bring in
outside choreographers.

00:10:57.156 --> 00:10:58.424 line:95%,end
It's just a fun thing to do.

00:10:58.491 --> 00:11:00.292 line:95%,end
I don't really think
that bringing in

00:11:00.359 --> 00:11:03.629 line:95%,end
an outside choreographer
is, like, a mechanism

00:11:03.696 --> 00:11:06.565 line:95%,end
to win, or lose, or be better.

00:11:06.632 --> 00:11:07.800 line:95%,end
It's just a fun thing to do.

00:11:07.867 --> 00:11:10.503 line:95%,end
And it's a fresh new take
on your choreography.

00:11:10.569 --> 00:11:12.571 line:95%,end
And it gives the children
an opportunity

00:11:12.638 --> 00:11:14.607 line:95%,end
to dance with somebody
other than you.


00:11:15.708 --> 00:11:17.243 line:95%,end
I'm here with the fabulous ladies
of the show

00:11:17.309 --> 00:11:20.046 line:95%,end
who make it happen every week,
make it so exciting.

00:11:20.112 --> 00:11:23.749 line:95%,end
So Kelly, I have a question
with you and Abby.

00:11:23.816 --> 00:11:26.752 line:95%,end
You guys have a long history together.

00:11:26.819 --> 00:11:28.554 line:95%,end
You guys have known each other
for a very long time...

00:11:28.621 --> 00:11:30.089 line:95%,end
-ABBY: Yes.
-JEFF: ...since you were what, two?

00:11:30.156 --> 00:11:31.590 line:95%,end
-Two and a half. Mm-hmm.
-JEFF: Two and a half.

00:11:31.657 --> 00:11:35.161 line:95%,end
You say--and you've said this before
that Abby's jealous of you.

00:11:36.062 --> 00:11:36.896 line:95%,end
Is that true?

00:11:36.962 --> 00:11:38.631 line:95%,end
And why do you feel that way?

00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:40.733 line:95%,end
I don't know that
Abby is jealous of me.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.868 line:95%,end
I think that Abby is...

00:11:43.869 --> 00:11:44.904 line:95%,end
mad at me,

00:11:45.805 --> 00:11:47.139 line:95%,end
holds a grudge against me.

00:11:47.206 --> 00:11:49.075 line:95%,end
I don't know
if it's because I quit dance.

00:11:49.141 --> 00:11:50.976 line:95%,end
You know, when we were younger,

00:11:51.043 --> 00:11:53.412 line:95%,end
she liked a guy, and he liked me.
I mean, there was--

00:11:53.479 --> 00:11:55.047 line:95%,end
She was 12, and he was 18, so--

00:11:55.114 --> 00:11:57.750 line:95%,end
-JEFF: Did she steal your boyfriend?
-I was not 12, but--

00:11:57.817 --> 00:11:59.151 line:95%,end
Did you steal her boyfriend?

00:11:59.218 --> 00:12:00.820 line:95%,end
No, he wasn't my boyfriend.

00:12:00.886 --> 00:12:01.987 line:95%,end
-No, it wasn't her boyfriend.
-JEFF: All right.

00:12:02.054 --> 00:12:03.622 line:95%,end
-She liked him.
-Did you--did you date him?

00:12:04.256 --> 00:12:05.758 line:95%,end
I didn't really date him, but--

00:12:05.825 --> 00:12:07.893 line:95%,end
-Did you kiss him?
-You just did him. Sorry.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.395 line:95%,end
Ah!

00:12:09.462 --> 00:12:10.863 line:95%,end
Jill Vertes!

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:12.064 line:95%,end
No, I didn't.

00:12:12.131 --> 00:12:14.600 line:95%,end
No, but seriously, there's a lot
of tension between you two.

00:12:14.667 --> 00:12:16.235 line:95%,end
And we see it.
It goes--it goes a long way.

00:12:16.302 --> 00:12:18.104 line:95%,end
I--I want to know about it. Tell me.

00:12:18.871 --> 00:12:20.973 line:95%,end
I--I think you would have
to ask Abby that question.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.608 line:95%,end
JEFF: Are you jealous
of the life that Kelly has?

00:12:22.675 --> 00:12:24.810 line:95%,end
No, not at all.

00:12:24.877 --> 00:12:26.345 line:95%,end
JEFF: So where does this tension
come from?

00:12:27.947 --> 00:12:30.583 line:95%,end
Don't forget, I was 14
when I started my company.

00:12:30.649 --> 00:12:32.752 line:95%,end
How can we forget?
You tell us every week.

00:12:32.818 --> 00:12:35.488 line:95%,end
I think that Kelly had great potential.

00:12:35.554 --> 00:12:37.289 line:95%,end
And although her dad--

00:12:37.356 --> 00:12:39.792 line:95%,end
She sure didn't show it in dance,
the mom's dance.

00:12:39.859 --> 00:12:42.228 line:95%,end
Stop. I didn't feel...

00:12:42.294 --> 00:12:44.296 line:95%,end
that your mom and dad pushed you

00:12:44.363 --> 00:12:46.365 line:95%,end
the way they should have.

00:12:46.432 --> 00:12:48.901 line:95%,end
I think I've done pretty well
for myself

00:12:48.968 --> 00:12:50.536 line:95%,end
without my parents pushing me.

00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:51.937 line:95%,end
-And...
-KELLY: I did what I wanted to do.

00:12:52.004 --> 00:12:54.240 line:95%,end
-...and you keep saying that.
-KELLY: I wanted to get married.

00:12:54.306 --> 00:12:55.407 line:95%,end
I wanted to have kids.

00:12:55.474 --> 00:12:57.042 line:95%,end
I wanted to be a stay-at-home mom.

00:12:57.109 --> 00:12:58.244 line:95%,end
And that's what I did.

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:00.980 line:95%,end
Why are you still holding that
against me now?

00:13:01.046 --> 00:13:02.314 line:95%,end
I'm not holding that against you.

00:13:02.381 --> 00:13:04.283 line:95%,end
KELLY: Well,
then what's your problem with me?

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:06.952 line:95%,end
I will do whatever my kids want to do,

00:13:07.019 --> 00:13:08.454 line:95%,end
just like my parents did for me.

00:13:08.521 --> 00:13:10.322 line:95%,end
-ABBY: So you're mad at me...
-And I lived a happy life.

00:13:10.389 --> 00:13:11.957 line:95%,end
...so you're mad at me because...

00:13:12.024 --> 00:13:14.226 line:95%,end
-KELLY: I'm not mad at you, Abby.
-...your kids don't want to do this,

00:13:14.293 --> 00:13:16.028 line:95%,end
but I'm not pushing them to do it.

00:13:16.095 --> 00:13:17.263 line:95%,end
-Is that what you're saying?
-No, you're mad at me

00:13:17.329 --> 00:13:19.732 line:95%,end
because I'm letting them
be mediocre, remember?

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:23.369 line:95%,end
Right. I am because I think that's sick.

00:13:23.969 --> 00:13:25.704 line:95%,end
-I think when your child...
-But my kids have to want it.

00:13:25.771 --> 00:13:28.207 line:95%,end
...is born with a God-given talent

00:13:28.274 --> 00:13:30.009 line:95%,end
that you should encourage it.

00:13:30.075 --> 00:13:31.210 line:95%,end
You should push it.

00:13:31.277 --> 00:13:32.778 line:95%,end
You should make it available to them.

00:13:32.845 --> 00:13:35.381 line:95%,end
But my kid was born
with a God-given talent.

00:13:35.447 --> 00:13:37.149 line:95%,end
-And she did win all your titles...
-ABBY: Right.

00:13:37.216 --> 00:13:39.451 line:95%,end
...and everything just like Maddie did.
And you burnt her out.

00:13:39.518 --> 00:13:41.320 line:95%,end
-Well, I disagree.
-KELLY: And you kept knocking her down

00:13:41.387 --> 00:13:42.555 line:95%,end
and knocking her down.

00:13:42.621 --> 00:13:43.823 line:95%,end
And now, she doesn't want
to dance anymore.

00:13:43.889 --> 00:13:45.491 line:95%,end
And that's the same thing
that happened with me

00:13:45.558 --> 00:13:47.259 line:95%,end
right around the same age as Brooke.

00:13:47.326 --> 00:13:49.929 line:95%,end
It was every day, six days a week,
I was at dance.

00:13:49.995 --> 00:13:51.230 line:95%,end
I couldn't do anything with my friends.

00:13:51.297 --> 00:13:52.765 line:95%,end
-I couldn't do...
-Kelly, you were not...

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:54.099 line:95%,end
-KELLY: ...any school functions.
-...at dance six days a week.

00:13:54.166 --> 00:13:56.202 line:95%,end
So you're telling me that Brooke
doesn't want to do it.

00:13:56.268 --> 00:13:58.938 line:95%,end
But then you're angry with me
for not giving

00:13:59.004 --> 00:14:01.540 line:95%,end
my every minute
and every energy to Brooke.

00:14:01.607 --> 00:14:03.909 line:95%,end
Brooke does want to do it.
That's why she's there.

00:14:03.976 --> 00:14:06.212 line:95%,end
And Brooke wants to do other things.

00:14:06.278 --> 00:14:08.013 line:95%,end
And that's why I'm giving her
the opportunity.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.748 line:95%,end
So Kelly, let me--
let me ask you a question.

00:14:10.482 --> 00:14:12.484 line:95%,end
At--at nationals, you--

00:14:12.551 --> 00:14:14.119 line:95%,end
you had a meltdown.

00:14:14.186 --> 00:14:15.821 line:95%,end
It's hard to watch your kids on stage

00:14:15.888 --> 00:14:18.224 line:95%,end
and think it's the last time
you're gonna watch them dance.


00:14:21.093 --> 00:14:22.528 line:95%,end
I just don't want to come back.

00:14:24.129 --> 00:14:28.868 line:95%,end
Is that because you're seeing
this scenario play out again?

00:14:28.934 --> 00:14:30.603 line:95%,end
You're seeing this play out
with your daughter

00:14:30.669 --> 00:14:32.271 line:95%,end
the same way that it played out with you?

00:14:32.338 --> 00:14:34.306 line:95%,end
I mean, when Brooke tells me that...

00:14:34.373 --> 00:14:36.342 line:95%,end
she just wants to be
with her friends and wants to--

00:14:36.408 --> 00:14:38.043 line:95%,end
I mean, I understand it.
I went through it.

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:39.578 line:95%,end
I'm not going to force them to dance

00:14:39.645 --> 00:14:41.714 line:95%,end
for the rest of their life
if that's not what they want.

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:44.083 line:95%,end
Then why force me to give them...

00:14:44.149 --> 00:14:45.885 line:95%,end
-Because I'm paying for dance class.
-...100% of my attention

00:14:45.951 --> 00:14:47.286 line:95%,end
when they don't really want it?

00:14:47.353 --> 00:14:48.888 line:95%,end
And I'm paying you
to give them your attention

00:14:48.954 --> 00:14:50.055 line:95%,end
while they're at class.

00:14:50.122 --> 00:14:52.758 line:95%,end
I think a lot of the kids don't want it
because you make it

00:14:52.825 --> 00:14:54.126 line:95%,end
so negative for them.

00:14:54.193 --> 00:14:55.527 line:95%,end
Why should Paige want it?

00:14:55.594 --> 00:14:57.596 line:95%,end
You tell her every day
she's not as good as Brooke,

00:14:57.663 --> 00:14:59.999 line:95%,end
or Mackenzie is not as good as Maddie.

00:15:00.065 --> 00:15:01.367 line:95%,end
Like, why should they want it?

00:15:01.433 --> 00:15:02.801 line:95%,end
But when is that going to click in
and they work harder?

00:15:02.868 --> 00:15:05.004 line:95%,end
They got on stage and go,
well, Miss Abby thinks I suck

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:06.472 line:95%,end
because Maddie is better than me,

00:15:06.538 --> 00:15:07.706 line:95%,end
or Brooke's better than me.

00:15:07.773 --> 00:15:09.208 line:95%,end
-Like...
-But when is it going to click in...

00:15:09.275 --> 00:15:10.876 line:95%,end
...why do you think
they even want that?

00:15:10.943 --> 00:15:12.544 line:95%,end
...and they're gonna say,
I'm going to prove her wrong?

00:15:12.611 --> 00:15:14.813 line:95%,end
KELLY: But I don't know, Abby.
Everybody is different.

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.815 line:95%,end
Maybe it hasn't kicked in
for them yet. Maybe...

00:15:16.882 --> 00:15:18.417 line:95%,end
-ABBY: Right.
-...it has for somebody else.

00:15:18.484 --> 00:15:20.286 line:95%,end
-Right, maybe it hasn't.
-Every kid is different.

00:15:20.352 --> 00:15:22.021 line:95%,end
And that's what you don't understand.

00:15:22.087 --> 00:15:24.223 line:95%,end
After teaching kids for that long,

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:27.359 line:95%,end
you don't understand
that every single child

00:15:27.426 --> 00:15:28.894 line:95%,end
-in this world is different.
-ABBY: I understand that.

00:15:28.961 --> 00:15:30.129 line:95%,end
-That's why they're all special.
-ABBY: I agree.

00:15:30.195 --> 00:15:31.630 line:95%,end
Some of them shouldn't dance.

00:15:31.697 --> 00:15:32.932 line:95%,end
Some of them
shouldn't be at my school.

00:15:32.998 --> 00:15:35.334 line:95%,end
But just because it doesn't click
for them at age 11

00:15:35.401 --> 00:15:37.603 line:95%,end
doesn't mean it's not going to click
for them at age 16.

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:38.871 line:95%,end
I am the one that's saying...

00:15:38.938 --> 00:15:40.773 line:95%,end
-KELLY: I know that.
-...let Paige wait.

00:15:40.839 --> 00:15:41.941 line:95%,end
You don't know
what the future holds.

00:15:42.007 --> 00:15:43.909 line:95%,end
But you keep telling me to have her quit
because she doesn't want it.

00:15:43.976 --> 00:15:45.377 line:95%,end
Maybe it just hasn't clicked for her yet.

00:15:45.444 --> 00:15:46.912 line:95%,end
I have said on many occasions,

00:15:46.979 --> 00:15:50.683 line:95%,end
I think that it will all
come together for Paige.

00:15:50.749 --> 00:15:52.084 line:95%,end
I've said it probably to everybody here.

00:15:52.151 --> 00:15:53.285 line:95%,end
Yeah, but every other word
out of your mouth is,

00:15:53.352 --> 00:15:54.820 line:95%,end
go ahead and leave.
Your kid is not wanted. They're mediocre.

00:15:54.887 --> 00:15:56.989 line:95%,end
But I think Paige
needs to have to want it.

00:15:57.056 --> 00:15:58.624 line:95%,end
It's been handed to her
on a platter.

00:15:58.691 --> 00:16:00.025 line:95%,end
And maybe she will
if you make her think

00:16:00.092 --> 00:16:01.827 line:95%,end
that she has the potential to do it.

00:16:01.894 --> 00:16:03.529 line:95%,end
-I've said it to her, Kelly.
-You are gonna want it,

00:16:03.595 --> 00:16:05.230 line:95%,end
-and you're going to want to do it.
-Kelly, I don't know,

00:16:05.297 --> 00:16:08.133 line:95%,end
maybe you're out in the parking lot
or down at Stations Four getting drunk,

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.803 line:95%,end
I've said it to her over and over

00:16:10.869 --> 00:16:12.471 line:95%,end
and over again, I've told Paige.

00:16:12.538 --> 00:16:14.740 line:95%,end
Okay, 100 times more than
you've said that,

00:16:14.807 --> 00:16:16.308 line:95%,end
you've said something negative to her.

00:16:16.375 --> 00:16:17.576 line:95%,end
So listen to what you want to.

00:16:18.043 --> 00:16:20.813 line:95%,end
So Kelly, when you had
this very emotional moment

00:16:20.879 --> 00:16:22.548 line:95%,end
at nationals, what happened?

00:16:22.614 --> 00:16:24.350 line:95%,end
-Why did you get so emotional?
-KELLY: Oh, God, I don't know.

00:16:24.416 --> 00:16:27.052 line:95%,end
I mean, I want my kids to dance

00:16:27.119 --> 00:16:28.954 line:95%,end
because I always danced,
and I loved it.

00:16:29.021 --> 00:16:30.389 line:95%,end
And I know my kids love being there.

00:16:30.456 --> 00:16:32.758 line:95%,end
They love being with the kids.

00:16:32.825 --> 00:16:34.126 line:95%,end
And I love being with the moms.

00:16:34.193 --> 00:16:35.728 line:95%,end
I mean, they're like family to me.

00:16:35.794 --> 00:16:38.897 line:95%,end
And as much as I hate Abby,
I love Abby.

00:16:38.964 --> 00:16:41.500 line:95%,end
And she's taught me a lot.

00:16:41.567 --> 00:16:44.303 line:95%,end
I spend more time with Abby
than I do with my own sister.

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:48.273 line:95%,end
It's just that it's been
such a big part of my life

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:50.876 line:95%,end
that I think it's hard for me
to give it up.

00:16:51.677 --> 00:16:53.145 line:95%,end
And I think it's hard
for my kids to give up.

00:16:53.212 --> 00:16:56.215 line:95%,end
And I think this past week,
she was nervous about Brooke.

00:16:56.582 --> 00:16:59.284 line:95%,end
(dramatic music playing)

00:17:07.559 --> 00:17:09.294 line:95%,end
ABBY: She was nervous
because she knew

00:17:09.361 --> 00:17:10.996 line:95%,end
that I'd done that number before.

00:17:11.063 --> 00:17:13.732 line:95%,end
And she could go out there,
and she could win it all,

00:17:13.799 --> 00:17:14.933 line:95%,end
or she could be second.

00:17:15.434 --> 00:17:17.536 line:95%,end
SINGER:
<i>âª Living on the dance floor âª</i>


00:17:19.671 --> 00:17:21.273 line:95%,end
JEFF: So Christi,

00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:24.209 line:95%,end
it seems like there's a lot of tension

00:17:24.276 --> 00:17:26.178 line:95%,end
between you and Melissa.

00:17:26.245 --> 00:17:28.180 line:95%,end
Why don't you ever stand up
to Abby, Melissa?

00:17:28.247 --> 00:17:30.516 line:95%,end
You always say that
you're her friend.

00:17:30.582 --> 00:17:33.252 line:95%,end
So you should have a different kind
of a connection with her.

00:17:33.318 --> 00:17:35.154 line:95%,end
So why don't you ever
stick up for the kids?

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:37.189 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I'm so sick of Christi
always getting on me

00:17:37.256 --> 00:17:39.124 line:95%,end
because my daughter has a gift.

00:17:39.191 --> 00:17:41.727 line:95%,end
This isn't--stop talking about my daughter
because she's nine years old.

00:17:41.794 --> 00:17:43.328 line:95%,end
We're not talking about your daughter.
We're talking about...

00:17:43.395 --> 00:17:45.464 line:95%,end
-Yes.
-...what you enable to happen.

00:17:45.531 --> 00:17:47.433 line:95%,end
You see what she does
to my kid and her kid,

00:17:47.499 --> 00:17:48.767 line:95%,end
and you don't stick up for them.

00:17:48.834 --> 00:17:51.837 line:95%,end
ANNOUNCER: <i>Maddie</i>
<i>from Abby Lee Dance Company.</i>

00:17:53.072 --> 00:17:55.808 line:95%,end
<i>Congratulations.</i>
<i>You got top scores.</i>

00:17:55.874 --> 00:17:58.644 line:95%,end
<i>-Give her a big round of applause.</i>
-Undefeated. Aren't ya' happy?

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:00.379 line:95%,end
-No. I'm not happy.
-ANNOUNCER: <i>Congratulations.</i>

00:18:00.446 --> 00:18:02.481 line:95%,end
<i>-You gotta take that big wacky bow.</i>
-Whatever.

00:18:02.548 --> 00:18:03.949 line:95%,end
JEFF: Can you talk
about that a little bit?

00:18:04.016 --> 00:18:05.851 line:95%,end
Melissa and I have a long history.

00:18:05.918 --> 00:18:08.053 line:95%,end
And there's been some things
done in the past

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.321 line:95%,end
that Melissa has done that...

00:18:10.422 --> 00:18:11.690 line:95%,end
I don't particularly like.

00:18:11.757 --> 00:18:14.993 line:95%,end
But she always plays
the I didn't do that, I'm innocent.

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:18.263 line:95%,end
And you know,
there's been a lot that's going on

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:19.765 line:95%,end
that Melissa has been the root of.

00:18:19.832 --> 00:18:22.034 line:95%,end
We both have done things
to each other.

00:18:22.701 --> 00:18:26.004 line:95%,end
But I think that we have
a different understanding now.

00:18:26.071 --> 00:18:29.174 line:95%,end
The animosity comes from things
that happened in years past.

00:18:29.241 --> 00:18:32.144 line:95%,end
-Right.
-For instance, Nia had a prop once.

00:18:32.211 --> 00:18:34.880 line:95%,end
It was a cane.
She was doing a solo.

00:18:34.947 --> 00:18:37.249 line:95%,end
And Mackenzie took it out,
and she broke it and put it back.

00:18:37.316 --> 00:18:38.717 line:95%,end
And we saw Mackenzie do it.

00:18:38.784 --> 00:18:40.252 line:95%,end
And then when Holly confronted Melissa,
Melissa goes,

00:18:40.319 --> 00:18:41.386 line:95%,end
Kenzie didn't do it.

00:18:41.453 --> 00:18:42.955 line:95%,end
But we saw her do it.

00:18:43.021 --> 00:18:45.390 line:95%,end
What I'm saying is just own it.

00:18:45.457 --> 00:18:47.226 line:95%,end
Melissa always says like,
oh, I don't care if Maddie

00:18:47.292 --> 00:18:49.027 line:95%,end
is at the top of the pyramid
until Maddie is not

00:18:49.094 --> 00:18:50.729 line:95%,end
at the top of the pyramid
for three weeks in a row.

00:18:50.796 --> 00:18:51.730 line:95%,end
And then she gets pissed off.

00:18:51.797 --> 00:18:55.000 line:95%,end
And she's always trying to play
the I'm so sweet part.

00:18:55.067 --> 00:18:57.669 line:95%,end
But there's a lot
of underlying things going on.

00:18:57.736 --> 00:19:00.305 line:95%,end
I think the only thing
that's different is we're on the show

00:19:00.372 --> 00:19:01.974 line:95%,end
and that you guys have to deal
with each other.

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:03.775 line:95%,end
I think you guys still feel
the same way.

00:19:03.842 --> 00:19:05.711 line:95%,end
They both want their kids
to be on top.

00:19:06.178 --> 00:19:07.779 line:95%,end
-Mm-hmm.
-And they're the two

00:19:07.846 --> 00:19:08.914 line:95%,end
that pretty much compete.

00:19:08.981 --> 00:19:12.317 line:95%,end
Holly and I know our kids
aren't going to be on the top.

00:19:12.384 --> 00:19:14.686 line:95%,end
It's just the way it is.

00:19:14.753 --> 00:19:16.788 line:95%,end
Or there are not gonna be
guaranteed solos every week.

00:19:16.855 --> 00:19:19.758 line:95%,end
Exactly. So for us to fight with them
is totally different.

00:19:19.825 --> 00:19:22.094 line:95%,end
These two fighting
for the top spot,

00:19:22.161 --> 00:19:24.429 line:95%,end
that's really what they do every week.

00:19:24.496 --> 00:19:27.099 line:95%,end
Yeah, but Chloe used
to beat Maddie consistently.

00:19:27.166 --> 00:19:29.835 line:95%,end
No, she's beat her but not consistently.

00:19:29.902 --> 00:19:31.737 line:95%,end
I mean, they've been back and forth
and back and forth.

00:19:31.803 --> 00:19:33.705 line:95%,end
Yes, and when all that happens,

00:19:33.772 --> 00:19:35.440 line:95%,end
you get very pissed off about it.

00:19:35.507 --> 00:19:37.709 line:95%,end
And so do you
when Chloe doesn't win.

00:19:39.044 --> 00:19:40.846 line:95%,end
Yes, but I have learned
how to deal with it.

00:19:40.913 --> 00:19:41.980 line:95%,end
My daughter learns
how to deal with it.

00:19:42.047 --> 00:19:44.216 line:95%,end
And I don't say, everything is fine.

00:19:44.283 --> 00:19:46.018 line:95%,end
That's where the problems come from
where you're like,

00:19:46.084 --> 00:19:47.252 line:95%,end
if Maddie doesn't win something,

00:19:47.319 --> 00:19:49.922 line:95%,end
there's always a reason
or an excuse.

00:19:49.988 --> 00:19:51.256 line:95%,end
Another time we were sitting
in the audience,

00:19:51.323 --> 00:19:53.425 line:95%,end
Chloe beat her doing something,
and you screamed,

00:19:53.492 --> 00:19:56.261 line:95%,end
oh, my God in the audience,
which is fine, Melissa.

00:19:56.328 --> 00:19:57.596 line:95%,end
It's okay to be competitive.

00:19:57.663 --> 00:19:59.164 line:95%,end
I'm the first to admit
that I'm competitive.

00:19:59.231 --> 00:20:01.066 line:95%,end
I am very competitive.
And you know what?

00:20:01.133 --> 00:20:02.634 line:95%,end
I have a different take on things.

00:20:02.701 --> 00:20:05.437 line:95%,end
I'm not going to fight
in front of my kids, number one.

00:20:05.504 --> 00:20:06.538 line:95%,end
I think it's ridiculous.

00:20:06.605 --> 00:20:07.673 line:95%,end
And first of all,

00:20:07.739 --> 00:20:09.775 line:95%,end
there's no reason
to fight with each other.

00:20:09.841 --> 00:20:10.909 line:95%,end
We need to be there for our kids.

00:20:10.976 --> 00:20:12.511 line:95%,end
And our kids need to learn
how to not to win and--

00:20:12.578 --> 00:20:16.215 line:95%,end
But as long as your kids are on top,
you feel that way.

00:20:16.281 --> 00:20:19.351 line:95%,end
Do you think
that Chloe deserved to win

00:20:19.418 --> 00:20:20.686 line:95%,end
over Maddie at nationals?

00:20:20.752 --> 00:20:24.856 line:95%,end
I think they were both equally as good.

00:20:24.923 --> 00:20:26.858 line:95%,end
JEFF: But do you think
Chloe was a better dancer?

00:20:26.925 --> 00:20:29.361 line:95%,end
No, I can't say that.
I think they were equally--

00:20:29.428 --> 00:20:30.963 line:95%,end
I think Maddie was flawless.

00:20:31.029 --> 00:20:32.631 line:95%,end
-And I think Chloe was flawless.
-JEFF: But Chloe won.

00:20:32.698 --> 00:20:33.799 line:95%,end
Right. I'm not a judge.

00:20:33.865 --> 00:20:34.900 line:95%,end
And I never pretend to be.

00:20:34.967 --> 00:20:36.368 line:95%,end
-I think it was great.
-How do you feel about it?

00:20:36.435 --> 00:20:38.337 line:95%,end
It's good.

00:20:38.403 --> 00:20:41.573 line:95%,end
If Chloe wasn't as good as she is,

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.008 line:95%,end
Maddie wouldn't be, either.

00:20:43.075 --> 00:20:46.044 line:95%,end
If Maddie wasn't doing
four and five, six turns,

00:20:46.111 --> 00:20:48.013 line:95%,end
Chloe wouldn't be trying to do them

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.249 line:95%,end
-and Nia and Paige and everybody.
-CHRISTI: I agree with you.

00:20:50.315 --> 00:20:51.917 line:95%,end
-But what I'm saying is...
-MELISSA: Yes, they do.


00:20:51.984 --> 00:20:54.386 line:95%,end
...is that that's great for one.

00:20:54.453 --> 00:20:56.355 line:95%,end
But everybody else is put down.

00:20:56.421 --> 00:20:57.956 line:95%,end
Let me say one thing to you.

00:20:58.023 --> 00:20:59.758 line:95%,end
-Every dog has his day.
-CHRISTI: But--

00:20:59.825 --> 00:21:02.160 line:95%,end
-Every kid's going to have their moment.
-MELISSA: All of our kids want it.

00:21:02.227 --> 00:21:03.662 line:95%,end
-All of our kids want it.
-ABBY: You know, these two kids

00:21:03.729 --> 00:21:04.963 line:95%,end
go neck and neck.

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:06.231 line:95%,end
JEFF:
Let's change topic for a second.

00:21:06.298 --> 00:21:07.766 line:95%,end
-Joining us today is...
-There you go.

00:21:07.833 --> 00:21:09.701 line:95%,end
...the woman that got Twitter buzzing.

00:21:09.768 --> 00:21:12.037 line:95%,end
Please welcome Kaya,

00:21:12.104 --> 00:21:15.274 line:95%,end
the dance mom that
wasn't afraid to tell it like it is.

00:21:15.807 --> 00:21:19.278 line:95%,end
Kaya, AKA "Black Patsy."

00:21:19.344 --> 00:21:20.512 line:95%,end
Take a look at this.

00:21:20.579 --> 00:21:22.648 line:95%,end
-And what is your daughter's name?
-Nicaya.

00:21:22.714 --> 00:21:25.284 line:95%,end
So what's your daughter's
dance background like?

00:21:25.884 --> 00:21:27.653 line:95%,end
I know you had mentioned no acro.

00:21:27.719 --> 00:21:30.255 line:95%,end
-We don't do acro.
-We are so into acro here.

00:21:30.322 --> 00:21:32.124 line:95%,end
Acro is for gymnasts.
We're just dancers.

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:33.492 line:95%,end
We don't do acro tricks.

00:21:33.558 --> 00:21:35.594 line:95%,end
There's a lot of other kids
who want to dance on this team.

00:21:35.661 --> 00:21:37.729 line:95%,end
So I don't know why
she would just get to walk in

00:21:37.796 --> 00:21:39.931 line:95%,end
and be on it when there's other kids
who've had to go through--

00:21:39.998 --> 00:21:41.800 line:95%,end
Other kids don't have
a resume like hers.

00:21:42.934 --> 00:21:45.771 line:95%,end
You don't want anybody else
on the team that could potentially

00:21:45.837 --> 00:21:47.306 line:95%,end
push your daughter to the back burner.

00:21:47.372 --> 00:21:48.874 line:95%,end
I'm not talking to you.

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:50.475 line:95%,end
But you're talking about me
and my child's presence.

00:21:50.542 --> 00:21:52.144 line:95%,end
-So I can interrupt and say...
-JILL: I didn't even--

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:53.679 line:95%,end
-...what I want to say.
-I don't want to even use your name.

00:21:53.745 --> 00:21:55.013 line:95%,end
That's why I keep saying her.

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.182 line:95%,end
I got a name I want to call you, too,
and not your own,

00:21:57.249 --> 00:21:58.483 line:95%,end
but I'm trying to be respectful.

00:21:59.484 --> 00:22:01.219 line:95%,end
Yes, I had a baby at 16.

00:22:01.286 --> 00:22:02.387 line:95%,end
Yes, I'm a lesbian.

00:22:02.454 --> 00:22:04.122 line:95%,end
Whatever that has to do with anything,

00:22:04.189 --> 00:22:06.024 line:95%,end
I see potential in my child.

00:22:06.091 --> 00:22:08.226 line:95%,end
But it's like you just
jumped down on me

00:22:08.293 --> 00:22:10.162 line:95%,end
like I'm trying to invade this team.

00:22:10.228 --> 00:22:13.465 line:95%,end
You called every one of us liars, haters.

00:22:13.532 --> 00:22:15.834 line:95%,end
-You some haters. You some liars.
-That's a name.

00:22:15.901 --> 00:22:17.936 line:95%,end
-Especially you.
-Oh, yeah, okay.

00:22:18.003 --> 00:22:19.404 line:95%,end
KAYA: You are phony as hell.

00:22:19.471 --> 00:22:21.006 line:95%,end
-So are you.
-You don't--

00:22:21.073 --> 00:22:22.441 line:95%,end
-CHRISTI: You know what?
-From what I see, you--you are fake.

00:22:22.507 --> 00:22:23.342 line:95%,end
I'm not phony at all.

00:22:23.408 --> 00:22:25.811 line:95%,end
Who I am is exactly
who I come across as.

00:22:25.877 --> 00:22:27.479 line:95%,end
Yeah, a bitch.
That's what you are.

00:22:30.182 --> 00:22:33.719 line:95%,end
You don't know a thing, bitch.

00:22:33.785 --> 00:22:35.921 line:95%,end
-I'll be that bitch.
-Don't let the door hit your (bleep)

00:22:35.987 --> 00:22:38.357 line:95%,end
-on the way out then.
-See, you want to watch your mouth

00:22:38.423 --> 00:22:39.591 line:95%,end
because I ain't the rest
of these dance mamas.

00:22:39.658 --> 00:22:41.660 line:95%,end
I'm not a doctor like Holly, boo.
I'm from the hood.

00:22:43.161 --> 00:22:44.496 line:95%,end
Believe that.

00:22:46.631 --> 00:22:48.233 line:95%,end
So Kaya, I have to ask you.

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:50.001 line:95%,end
I would never call you "Black Patsy."

00:22:50.068 --> 00:22:52.104 line:95%,end
But you call yourself "Black Patsy."

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:53.305 line:95%,end
How would you like for me
to refer to you?

00:22:53.372 --> 00:22:54.906 line:95%,end
-You can just call me Kaya.
-JEFF: Call you Kaya.

00:22:54.973 --> 00:22:56.341 line:95%,end
All right, Kaya it is.

00:22:56.408 --> 00:22:58.577 line:95%,end
So Kaya, the--the first thing
I have to ask you

00:22:58.643 --> 00:23:00.846 line:95%,end
is why do you call yourself "Black Patsy?"

00:23:02.314 --> 00:23:03.915 line:95%,end
My mom gave me that name.

00:23:03.982 --> 00:23:06.251 line:95%,end
And it just kind of caught on
at the studio from...

00:23:06.785 --> 00:23:08.387 line:95%,end
Patsy Ramsey.

00:23:08.453 --> 00:23:10.756 line:95%,end
And so she kind of thought
I was a crazy stage mom.

00:23:10.822 --> 00:23:13.058 line:95%,end
And then another mom called me that
when my daughter started competing.

00:23:13.125 --> 00:23:14.760 line:95%,end
And it just kind of caught on.

00:23:14.826 --> 00:23:18.130 line:95%,end
All right, so Nicaya, your daughter,
is a beautiful dancer.

00:23:18.196 --> 00:23:21.066 line:95%,end
What initially brought you
to the Abby Lee Miller Company?

00:23:21.133 --> 00:23:23.201 line:95%,end
Her reputation for making stars.

00:23:23.268 --> 00:23:25.036 line:95%,end
And Nicaya is a star.

00:23:25.103 --> 00:23:26.938 line:95%,end
So how do you feel about
being a new mom

00:23:27.005 --> 00:23:28.273 line:95%,end
trying to fit in with this group?

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:30.342 line:95%,end
I wouldn't say I'm trying to fit in
with this group.

00:23:30.409 --> 00:23:32.377 line:95%,end
But I'm just the new mom.

00:23:32.444 --> 00:23:33.545 line:95%,end
I don't want to fit in with the group.

00:23:33.612 --> 00:23:35.013 line:95%,end
I want her to be a part of this team.

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.381 line:95%,end
But I don't want to fit in
with the moms.

00:23:37.149 --> 00:23:39.951 line:95%,end
Who was the one that gave you
the strongest impression?

00:23:40.018 --> 00:23:41.586 line:95%,end
-Christi.
-JEFF: Christi?

00:23:41.653 --> 00:23:43.121 line:95%,end
-Mm-hmm.
-JEFF: So why did you and Christi clash?

00:23:43.188 --> 00:23:45.557 line:95%,end
I don't know. Why did Christi have
such a problem with me?

00:23:45.624 --> 00:23:48.326 line:95%,end
I didn't understand why Abby
would allow someone who came in,

00:23:48.393 --> 00:23:50.228 line:95%,end
especially after the way
Abby explained it.

00:23:50.295 --> 00:23:51.797 line:95%,end
I think she said stocked.

00:23:51.863 --> 00:23:54.099 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I think you did say stocked.
But...

00:23:54.166 --> 00:23:55.700 line:95%,end
she just let someone
walk in off the street--

00:23:55.767 --> 00:23:57.903 line:95%,end
So you didn't see any room
for improvement on your team?

00:23:57.969 --> 00:23:59.471 line:95%,end
You didn't think that
she was an asset to your team?

00:23:59.538 --> 00:24:00.705 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: It didn't matter.

00:24:00.772 --> 00:24:02.240 line:95%,end
The fact was it was late
in the season.

00:24:02.307 --> 00:24:04.075 line:95%,end
We were on the road to nationals.

00:24:04.142 --> 00:24:05.410 line:95%,end
And she didn't audition.

00:24:05.477 --> 00:24:06.912 line:95%,end
Your issue was with what Abby did.

00:24:06.978 --> 00:24:09.114 line:95%,end
Why didn't you take that out with her?
Why were you just so--

00:24:09.181 --> 00:24:10.682 line:95%,end
I didn't say a word to you.

00:24:10.749 --> 00:24:12.384 line:95%,end
I believe you started with me.
And I defended myself.

00:24:12.451 --> 00:24:14.319 line:95%,end
No, I think you started with me.

00:24:14.386 --> 00:24:15.954 line:95%,end
I mean, from the day I walked in there,

00:24:16.021 --> 00:24:17.122 line:95%,end
it's like you had an issue with me.

00:24:17.189 --> 00:24:18.723 line:95%,end
If it was with Abby,
you should have talked to her

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:20.125 line:95%,end
about the way she runs her business...

00:24:20.192 --> 00:24:21.193 line:95%,end
-CHRISTI: I did.
-...not me.

00:24:21.259 --> 00:24:23.261 line:95%,end
SINGER: <i>âª Living on the dance floor âª</i>


00:24:24.696 --> 00:24:26.298 line:95%,end
JEFF: Thank you, Kaya, for coming.

00:24:26.364 --> 00:24:29.468 line:95%,end
So Jill, you seem
very uncomfortable right now.

00:24:29.534 --> 00:24:30.836 line:95%,end
-Well...
-JEFF: What--what's going on

00:24:30.902 --> 00:24:33.038 line:95%,end
-on between the two of you?
-JILL: ...Kaya said she doesn't want

00:24:33.104 --> 00:24:35.474 line:95%,end
to be a part of the team.
She doesn't want to make friends.

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:37.142 line:95%,end
-And I think Abby always makes it a...
-That's--

00:24:37.209 --> 00:24:39.144 line:95%,end
...point to say there's so many
other children in this studio

00:24:39.211 --> 00:24:40.612 line:95%,end
who want this opportunity.

00:24:40.679 --> 00:24:43.014 line:95%,end
So why would you allow
a stranger to come in

00:24:43.081 --> 00:24:44.716 line:95%,end
and have the opportunity
that you want for students

00:24:44.783 --> 00:24:47.419 line:95%,end
that have been loyal customers
for so many years?

00:24:47.486 --> 00:24:48.920 line:95%,end
-It was the--
-But you made it a point

00:24:48.987 --> 00:24:50.789 line:95%,end
to always make me feel
like I did something wrong.

00:24:50.856 --> 00:24:52.257 line:95%,end
Well, you know what?
That's your perception.

00:24:52.324 --> 00:24:53.558 line:95%,end
-You made it your point.
-CHRISTI: Okay, well, then--

00:24:53.625 --> 00:24:55.160 line:95%,end
Because she was no threat
to your child when she was there,

00:24:55.227 --> 00:24:56.061 line:95%,end
-or was she?
-CHRISTI: You know what?

00:24:56.127 --> 00:24:57.262 line:95%,end
If you don't see my point of view,

00:24:57.329 --> 00:24:59.564 line:95%,end
then we're going to have
to just agree that we disagree.

00:24:59.631 --> 00:25:02.200 line:95%,end
So Kaya, when you came in,
do you feel like the ladies

00:25:02.267 --> 00:25:04.669 line:95%,end
went out of their way
to make you feel uncomfortable?

00:25:04.736 --> 00:25:07.172 line:95%,end
Or do you feel like you really stirred
the pot yourself?

00:25:07.239 --> 00:25:10.509 line:95%,end
I didn't stir the pot.
I think that Melissa and Holly

00:25:10.575 --> 00:25:12.844 line:95%,end
did the best they could
to make me feel comfortable.

00:25:12.911 --> 00:25:15.313 line:95%,end
I understand that you guys
have an alliance with them

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:17.282 line:95%,end
because you've been working
with them for so long.

00:25:17.349 --> 00:25:18.984 line:95%,end
Well, it seems like you held your own.

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:20.752 line:95%,end
Well, yeah, she wanted to beat us up.

00:25:20.819 --> 00:25:21.953 line:95%,end
We were ready to jump you,
though, for our team.

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:23.154 line:95%,end
I mean, we don't do that.

00:25:23.221 --> 00:25:25.991 line:95%,end
And if you ever would want
your child on the team,

00:25:26.057 --> 00:25:27.392 line:95%,end
we don't talk to one another--

00:25:27.459 --> 00:25:28.460 line:95%,end
Are you serious?

00:25:28.527 --> 00:25:30.662 line:95%,end
Have you--do you--
do watch the show at all?

00:25:30.729 --> 00:25:32.097 line:95%,end
Yes, I'm totally serious.
There's a line, and we don't cross it.

00:25:32.163 --> 00:25:33.398 line:95%,end
KAYA: You--you don't talk
to each other like that?

00:25:33.465 --> 00:25:34.633 line:95%,end
We don't cross the line.

00:25:34.699 --> 00:25:36.401 line:95%,end
You telling Christi
you're going to F her up

00:25:36.468 --> 00:25:37.469 line:95%,end
is crossing the line.

00:25:37.536 --> 00:25:39.304 line:95%,end
I think I had an issue with both of you
because they were talking

00:25:39.371 --> 00:25:41.606 line:95%,end
about somebody who came out
or supposed to be gay,

00:25:41.673 --> 00:25:43.675 line:95%,end
and I kept hearing the (bleep) word
get thrown around.

00:25:43.742 --> 00:25:45.143 line:95%,end
-Oh, I've never said that word.
-I've never said that word--

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:47.345 line:95%,end
It was not directed towards me.
It was between the two of you guys.

00:25:47.412 --> 00:25:49.080 line:95%,end
-Me?
-KAYA: Yes.

00:25:49.147 --> 00:25:50.715 line:95%,end
KAYA: Nobody's gonna own up to it.

00:25:50.782 --> 00:25:52.217 line:95%,end
-I wish they would play the tapes back.
-CHRISTI: You know what?

00:25:52.284 --> 00:25:54.185 line:95%,end
I have lots of gay friends.

00:25:54.252 --> 00:25:55.987 line:95%,end
-I have no problem with homosexuality.
-That's always the issue.

00:25:56.054 --> 00:25:57.322 line:95%,end
-I have lots of gay friends.
-CHRISTI: I do.

00:25:57.389 --> 00:25:58.857 line:95%,end
I have lots of Black friends,
all of that. Either way...

00:25:58.924 --> 00:26:00.892 line:95%,end
-Well, Melissa doesn't even think you are.
-KAYA: ...we don't throw...

00:26:00.959 --> 00:26:02.928 line:95%,end
-KAYA: Excuse me?
-She thinks that that's just a front,

00:26:02.994 --> 00:26:05.063 line:95%,end
-that you're not a lesbian.
-Who cares if you're gay or not?

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:06.364 line:95%,end
-I don't care.
-KAYA: Who thinks it's just a front?

00:26:06.431 --> 00:26:08.800 line:95%,end
Melissa said
I don't think she's a lesbian

00:26:09.367 --> 00:26:11.570 line:95%,end
because you said you wanted
to date her brother.

00:26:11.636 --> 00:26:13.738 line:95%,end
My partner's name
is tattooed on my back.

00:26:13.805 --> 00:26:15.040 line:95%,end
And I can call her if you'd like.

00:26:15.106 --> 00:26:16.875 line:95%,end
I mean, that's not one
I just throw out there for fun.

00:26:16.942 --> 00:26:18.643 line:95%,end
I'm really a lesbian.
I'm not really Black, though.

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:20.145 line:95%,end
Was that obvious?

00:26:20.211 --> 00:26:21.646 line:95%,end
-Yeah.
-I really am a lesbian, though.

00:26:21.713 --> 00:26:23.582 line:95%,end
But she was confused
because you said you wanted to go out

00:26:23.648 --> 00:26:25.250 line:95%,end
-with her brother.
-KAYA: I was making a joke with her

00:26:25.317 --> 00:26:27.485 line:95%,end
just like I joked and said
you had a nice ass.

00:26:27.552 --> 00:26:28.687 line:95%,end
It was a joke.

00:26:28.753 --> 00:26:29.955 line:95%,end
I didn't know you said I had a nice ass.

00:26:30.021 --> 00:26:31.790 line:95%,end
-JEFF: So Melissa--
-It's a flat one.

00:26:31.856 --> 00:26:33.658 line:95%,end
(interposing voices)

00:26:33.725 --> 00:26:35.026 line:95%,end
-No.
-KAYA: Okay. That's--

00:26:35.093 --> 00:26:37.262 line:95%,end
So Christi, I got--I got one.

00:26:37.329 --> 00:26:38.830 line:95%,end
Have you ever had
another woman tell you

00:26:38.897 --> 00:26:39.931 line:95%,end
she's going to F you up?

00:26:39.998 --> 00:26:41.099 line:95%,end
No, I can't say I have.

00:26:41.166 --> 00:26:43.335 line:95%,end
I've never, either,
and I kind of got nervous. But I--

00:26:43.401 --> 00:26:45.003 line:95%,end
we really did have to think--

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:47.038 line:95%,end
we thought maybe
we were gonna have to get in a rumble.

00:26:47.105 --> 00:26:48.440 line:95%,end
Did you think--did you think
things were gonna get...

00:26:48.506 --> 00:26:49.608 line:95%,end
-MELISSA: I did. I did, absolutely.
-...throw down?

00:26:49.674 --> 00:26:51.343 line:95%,end
Maybe perhaps I might have
to pull your hair.

00:26:51.409 --> 00:26:52.711 line:95%,end
I felt like I was
in a high school bathroom.

00:26:52.777 --> 00:26:53.878 line:95%,end
-I was running out.
-Okay.

00:26:53.945 --> 00:26:56.314 line:95%,end
Jill was like, I'm going to have
to pull hair, you know.

00:26:56.381 --> 00:26:57.482 line:95%,end
We don't do that.
We don't cross the line.

00:26:57.549 --> 00:26:59.084 line:95%,end
Stop saying what we don't do
because you've been crossing the line

00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:01.052 line:95%,end
ever since this show started,
all of you have.

00:27:01.119 --> 00:27:02.988 line:95%,end
So don't say what you don't do
because you're a bunch

00:27:03.054 --> 00:27:04.656 line:95%,end
-of bitter, toxic ass women.
-JILL: ...you come in and judge.

00:27:04.723 --> 00:27:06.291 line:95%,end
So why would you want
to be a part of this?

00:27:06.358 --> 00:27:08.760 line:95%,end
If that's what a dance mom is,
I don't want to be that.

00:27:08.827 --> 00:27:11.029 line:95%,end
I want this for my daughter.
And that's it. It's about my child.

00:27:11.096 --> 00:27:13.264 line:95%,end
I see you guys make it about yourselves.

00:27:13.331 --> 00:27:16.267 line:95%,end
It's not about--it's about my child.
That's it.

00:27:16.334 --> 00:27:18.536 line:95%,end
You said that
you felt betrayed by Holly.

00:27:18.603 --> 00:27:19.971 line:95%,end
Why?

00:27:20.038 --> 00:27:21.840 line:95%,end
When Nicaya first walked
into the studio,

00:27:21.906 --> 00:27:23.775 line:95%,end
<i>-how Nia's face just lit up...</i>
-HOLLY: <i>I remember that.</i>

00:27:23.842 --> 00:27:25.443 line:95%,end
...and it wasn't because
that's a new dancer.

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:28.046 line:95%,end
She lit up because wow,
there's another one of me here.

00:27:28.113 --> 00:27:29.714 line:95%,end
There was another Black person there.

00:27:29.781 --> 00:27:31.316 line:95%,end
And I just think that was special.

00:27:31.383 --> 00:27:32.851 line:95%,end
And I would think that
you would embrace

00:27:32.917 --> 00:27:35.020 line:95%,end
that there's more diversity on the team,
that you would have been

00:27:35.086 --> 00:27:36.354 line:95%,end
more accepting of Nicaya,

00:27:36.421 --> 00:27:38.223 line:95%,end
whether we stalked Abby,
if that's her word.

00:27:38.289 --> 00:27:41.226 line:95%,end
Whatever the case is, I think that
you would have had my back more.

00:27:41.292 --> 00:27:42.227 line:95%,end
And it's kind of like--

00:27:42.293 --> 00:27:43.895 line:95%,end
-But we don't treat Holly or Nia...
-I'm not talking to you.

00:27:43.962 --> 00:27:45.230 line:95%,end
-I am not--and please--
-...any differently

00:27:45.296 --> 00:27:46.631 line:95%,end
-than we treat anybody else.
-Hold on. Let's--

00:27:46.698 --> 00:27:48.466 line:95%,end
please don't make me go there
because maybe

00:27:48.533 --> 00:27:49.734 line:95%,end
you don't treat them like that.

00:27:49.801 --> 00:27:50.902 line:95%,end
When--when I was at the convention

00:27:50.969 --> 00:27:52.671 line:95%,end
and I was watching how things
were going down,

00:27:52.737 --> 00:27:55.540 line:95%,end
I see how your girls kind of
get into their little clique,

00:27:55.607 --> 00:27:57.909 line:95%,end
and they exclude Nia.
I don't think you see that...

00:27:57.976 --> 00:27:59.344 line:95%,end
-My kid never excludes Nia.
-...because you said once upon a time,

00:27:59.411 --> 00:28:01.279 line:95%,end
-that used to be the case.
-Nia has been in my home.

00:28:01.346 --> 00:28:03.314 line:95%,end
-Chloe has been--
-No--she and she probably is there,

00:28:03.381 --> 00:28:05.016 line:95%,end
but I'm telling you what I saw.

00:28:05.083 --> 00:28:06.184 line:95%,end
Let's let Holly respond.

00:28:06.251 --> 00:28:07.952 line:95%,end
I agree.
I said from the very beginning,

00:28:08.019 --> 00:28:10.388 line:95%,end
Nia did light up
when Nicaya entered the studio

00:28:10.455 --> 00:28:14.059 line:95%,end
because there are times
that she feels like she's the only one.

00:28:14.125 --> 00:28:16.327 line:95%,end
There are things that are just unique
and different,

00:28:16.394 --> 00:28:18.296 line:95%,end
like as simple as her hair.

00:28:18.363 --> 00:28:20.165 line:95%,end
That's a big issue for Nia.

00:28:20.231 --> 00:28:22.367 line:95%,end
And so I think
that's a wonderful thing.


00:28:22.434 --> 00:28:25.804 line:95%,end
And although I will say
it was great for Nia to have...

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:27.939 line:95%,end
someone who I think she could relate to
on some level,

00:28:28.006 --> 00:28:29.741 line:95%,end
which is very good,

00:28:29.808 --> 00:28:31.309 line:95%,end
I am not just because someone--

00:28:31.376 --> 00:28:32.877 line:95%,end
you know, judging
by the color of someone's skin,

00:28:32.944 --> 00:28:35.547 line:95%,end
I'm gonna say, okay,
automatically you get a pass

00:28:35.613 --> 00:28:36.748 line:95%,end
because you're a good person.

00:28:36.815 --> 00:28:39.718 line:95%,end
I want to see the content
of your character first

00:28:39.784 --> 00:28:42.387 line:95%,end
before I judge you based
on the color of your skin.

00:28:42.921 --> 00:28:46.458 line:95%,end
In the dressing room
when we had that huge eruption,

00:28:46.524 --> 00:28:49.861 line:95%,end
that was something
out of some '70s B movie.

00:28:49.928 --> 00:28:52.864 line:95%,end
To me, it was almost--
it was very stereotypical.

00:28:52.931 --> 00:28:55.133 line:95%,end
And I had not seen that side of you

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:56.968 line:95%,end
-that reflected that behavior.
-Well, yeah, because at that point

00:28:57.035 --> 00:28:59.104 line:95%,end
when I stepped outside
into the hallway for something,

00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:01.005 line:95%,end
and I hear them in there
talking about me, saying,

00:29:01.072 --> 00:29:03.007 line:95%,end
well, she probably can't even afford
to pay our tuition.

00:29:03.074 --> 00:29:04.676 line:95%,end
She's a single mom with four kids.

00:29:04.743 --> 00:29:07.712 line:95%,end
Things like that that I hear,
yes, that pushed me to that point.

00:29:08.413 --> 00:29:09.547 line:95%,end
-JEFF: So Kaya--
-Cause that's not something that

00:29:09.614 --> 00:29:11.983 line:95%,end
-should have been discussed.
-So Kaya, the floor is yours.

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:13.384 line:95%,end
All these ladies are here.

00:29:13.451 --> 00:29:16.087 line:95%,end
What do you want to say to them
as a--as a whole

00:29:16.154 --> 00:29:18.456 line:95%,end
about how they treated you
and how they made you feel?

00:29:19.157 --> 00:29:21.559 line:95%,end
Well, I didn't get a chance
to really to get to meet you.

00:29:21.626 --> 00:29:23.495 line:95%,end
So I think you're a blast, though.

00:29:23.561 --> 00:29:25.096 line:95%,end
-You're funny.
-Well, thank you.

00:29:25.897 --> 00:29:27.699 line:95%,end
And again, I really, really like

00:29:27.766 --> 00:29:29.200 line:95%,end
how you embraced me
and my daughter

00:29:29.267 --> 00:29:30.502 line:95%,end
and made us feel so welcome.

00:29:30.568 --> 00:29:33.271 line:95%,end
And I hope that that was sincere
because I really, really do like you.

00:29:33.338 --> 00:29:36.074 line:95%,end
And I think that you need to find you
a different set of friends

00:29:36.141 --> 00:29:37.809 line:95%,end
because you're too good for them,
seriously.

00:29:38.676 --> 00:29:41.112 line:95%,end
Holly, I apologize if it was offensive

00:29:41.179 --> 00:29:43.748 line:95%,end
that I called you a sell-out.
I just--again, I--

00:29:43.815 --> 00:29:44.783 line:95%,end
I feel like I feel.

00:29:44.849 --> 00:29:47.152 line:95%,end
I feel like you could have done
a better job of embracing us,

00:29:47.218 --> 00:29:50.155 line:95%,end
even hey, just be our cheerleader
because we both are Black.

00:29:50.221 --> 00:29:51.523 line:95%,end
I don't know. But...

00:29:51.589 --> 00:29:53.191 line:95%,end
you made your point. I'm done with that.

00:29:53.258 --> 00:29:54.959 line:95%,end
All right, so take a look
at this side of the room.

00:29:55.827 --> 00:29:57.362 line:95%,end
Do I have to?

00:29:57.428 --> 00:29:58.663 line:95%,end
I hate to pick on you
because you've been

00:29:58.730 --> 00:30:01.299 line:95%,end
so quiet over there, Kelly. But...

00:30:01.366 --> 00:30:04.769 line:95%,end
I think you are, like, the epitome
of crazy stage mom.

00:30:04.836 --> 00:30:08.239 line:95%,end
I mean, like, seriously,
you are the white Patsy now,

00:30:08.306 --> 00:30:09.541 line:95%,end
the other white Patsy.

00:30:09.607 --> 00:30:12.477 line:95%,end
So why should you not like me
when you call yourself "Black Patsy?"

00:30:12.544 --> 00:30:15.013 line:95%,end
-KAYA: Somebody else gave me the name.
-We should, like, be partners in crime.

00:30:15.079 --> 00:30:16.881 line:95%,end
There is a such thing
as being too involved

00:30:16.948 --> 00:30:18.249 line:95%,end
in your daughter's dancing.

00:30:18.316 --> 00:30:20.685 line:95%,end
I think you get a little
too emotionally involved in it.

00:30:20.752 --> 00:30:22.821 line:95%,end
And I think it might be
because your dance career

00:30:22.887 --> 00:30:25.056 line:95%,end
didn't go where it was supposed to go,
or you stopped.

00:30:25.123 --> 00:30:26.090 line:95%,end
Whatever your reason was,

00:30:26.157 --> 00:30:28.560 line:95%,end
I think you're kind of living
through your kids.

00:30:28.626 --> 00:30:30.995 line:95%,end
And that's not a good thing.

00:30:31.663 --> 00:30:32.697 line:95%,end
KELLY: Okay.

00:30:32.764 --> 00:30:35.800 line:95%,end
(sighs) You were just, like,
way too damn tough for me.

00:30:35.867 --> 00:30:37.602 line:95%,end
I don't know where
you get that from, but--

00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:40.338 line:95%,end
CATHY:
I know. She worked at Hooters.

00:30:40.405 --> 00:30:41.773 line:95%,end
-Oh.
-(laughs)

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:43.541 line:95%,end
-Is that where you get that from?
-For God's sake, Cathy.

00:30:43.608 --> 00:30:45.476 line:95%,end
-You don't get tough working at Hooters.
-No, you just get grabbed.

00:30:45.543 --> 00:30:47.679 line:95%,end
With all those guys
pawing all over you? You don't?

00:30:47.745 --> 00:30:49.681 line:95%,end
I think you're really, really bitter
and angry.

00:30:49.747 --> 00:30:52.250 line:95%,end
I don't know if it's something going on
in your personal life or whatever it is.

00:30:52.317 --> 00:30:55.153 line:95%,end
But you are just one
bitter bitch, seriously.

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:56.387 line:95%,end
I don't know what I did to you.

00:30:56.454 --> 00:30:58.556 line:95%,end
I don't know why you had a problem
with my child being on the team,

00:30:58.623 --> 00:31:00.792 line:95%,end
if she was a threat to your kid,
and she was.

00:31:00.859 --> 00:31:03.461 line:95%,end
We didn't get to stay long enough
for us to prove it, but she was.

00:31:04.629 --> 00:31:06.097 line:95%,end
Oh, and you, you, you.

00:31:06.164 --> 00:31:08.399 line:95%,end
I think the way you feel about me
is based on whoever

00:31:08.466 --> 00:31:10.501 line:95%,end
is sitting next to you.
You're kind of like a chameleon.

00:31:10.568 --> 00:31:12.470 line:95%,end
I mean, if somebody next to you
is not liking me,

00:31:12.537 --> 00:31:13.504 line:95%,end
then you don't like me.

00:31:13.571 --> 00:31:14.839 line:95%,end
-But the thing is--
-JEFF: All right, so--

00:31:14.906 --> 00:31:17.609 line:95%,end
--the thing is, Kaya, I think you don't--
you didn't give us a chance.

00:31:17.675 --> 00:31:20.879 line:95%,end
You made--
you came into the studio

00:31:20.945 --> 00:31:23.248 line:95%,end
with your own assumptions
and judgments.

00:31:23.314 --> 00:31:25.783 line:95%,end
Like, when you first entered
the dance studio,

00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:27.518 line:95%,end
like, I was trying to make small talk.

00:31:27.585 --> 00:31:30.555 line:95%,end
And it was--it was very hard
not to be defensive

00:31:30.622 --> 00:31:32.924 line:95%,end
because you came in and said
you didn't think acro

00:31:32.991 --> 00:31:35.960 line:95%,end
was a real style of dance
and that we weren't really charismatic

00:31:36.027 --> 00:31:37.929 line:95%,end
or entertaining with our dance.

00:31:37.996 --> 00:31:39.664 line:95%,end
So already...

00:31:39.731 --> 00:31:41.666 line:95%,end
-JILL: I wasn't here to make friends.
-...I was a little bit on edge.

00:31:41.733 --> 00:31:43.568 line:95%,end
I'm like, who is this person
who just walked in?

00:31:43.635 --> 00:31:45.904 line:95%,end
It's like, this is our second home.

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:48.139 line:95%,end
And you're like a guest
or a visitor in the home.

00:31:48.206 --> 00:31:49.607 line:95%,end
And you're already, like,
you're critiquing everything.

00:31:49.674 --> 00:31:51.075 line:95%,end
If somebody walks into your home,

00:31:51.142 --> 00:31:52.710 line:95%,end
do you just sit there
and just automatically--

00:31:52.777 --> 00:31:54.545 line:95%,end
No, but I wouldn't walk in and say,

00:31:54.612 --> 00:31:57.882 line:95%,end
I don't like your rug, your shoes,
your face, and all this other stuff.

00:31:57.949 --> 00:32:00.118 line:95%,end
You asked me my opinion,
and I gave it to you. You asked me.

00:32:00.184 --> 00:32:02.887 line:95%,end
I didn't come right in there just saying,
hey, I didn't like your recital.

00:32:02.954 --> 00:32:05.556 line:95%,end
I think the acro is not a real,
you know, dance.

00:32:05.623 --> 00:32:06.891 line:95%,end
It's not--I didn't--you asked me.

00:32:06.958 --> 00:32:09.160 line:95%,end
So what was I supposed to do?
Don't you value honesty?

00:32:09.227 --> 00:32:10.361 line:95%,end
I think--I think we do.

00:32:10.428 --> 00:32:12.530 line:95%,end
I think constructive criticism
is--is a good thing.

00:32:12.597 --> 00:32:14.799 line:95%,end
But what you did was a little over--

00:32:14.866 --> 00:32:17.502 line:95%,end
it's a little overboard
compared to what we're used to.

00:32:17.568 --> 00:32:18.770 line:95%,end
-That's all.
-JEFF: All right, well, Kaya,

00:32:18.836 --> 00:32:19.938 line:95%,end
thank you so much for coming.


00:32:21.105 --> 00:32:24.342 line:95%,end
I'm sitting down with the fascinating
women of <i>Dance Moms</i>

00:32:24.409 --> 00:32:26.744 line:95%,end
Now, with all the drama
and all the heartache,

00:32:26.811 --> 00:32:28.713 line:95%,end
I actually have a chance now
to sit down

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:32.650 line:95%,end
with the real stars of the show,
the girls.

00:32:33.384 --> 00:32:34.986 line:95%,end
Welcome, ladies. How are you?

00:32:35.053 --> 00:32:36.587 line:95%,end
GIRLS: Good. How are you?

00:32:36.654 --> 00:32:38.323 line:95%,end
All right, so I want to--
I want to introduce each of you.

00:32:38.389 --> 00:32:39.958 line:95%,end
So we've got Melissa's daughters,

00:32:40.024 --> 00:32:41.659 line:95%,end
Mackenzie and Maddie,

00:32:42.794 --> 00:32:45.129 line:95%,end
Kelly's daughters, Brooke and Paige,

00:32:46.597 --> 00:32:49.033 line:95%,end
-Christi's daughter Chloe.
-Hi.

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:50.535 line:95%,end
JEFF: Jill's daughter, Kendall,

00:32:51.336 --> 00:32:52.804 line:95%,end
Holly's daughter, Nia,

00:32:53.571 --> 00:32:56.341 line:95%,end
and, of course,
Cathy's daughter, Vivian.

00:32:57.008 --> 00:32:58.309 line:95%,end
So happy to have you guys here.

00:32:58.376 --> 00:32:59.344 line:95%,end
You been having fun?

00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:00.478 line:95%,end
GIRLS: Yes. Yes.

00:33:00.545 --> 00:33:03.047 line:95%,end
Well, we've sure been having
a lot of fun watching you.

00:33:03.114 --> 00:33:04.749 line:95%,end
So I've got one question
for each of you.

00:33:04.816 --> 00:33:06.918 line:95%,end
So Nia, here's what--
here's what I want to know from you.

00:33:06.985 --> 00:33:09.854 line:95%,end
So what's your best memory
of the past two seasons

00:33:09.921 --> 00:33:11.289 line:95%,end
of being on <i>Dance Moms?</i>

00:33:12.256 --> 00:33:15.093 line:95%,end
Probably just being with my friends
and learn--

00:33:15.159 --> 00:33:17.862 line:95%,end
and getting better as a dancer.

00:33:17.929 --> 00:33:19.030 line:95%,end
Well, you know, the thing is,

00:33:19.097 --> 00:33:20.965 line:95%,end
you really have gotten
a lot better as a dancer

00:33:21.032 --> 00:33:23.368 line:95%,end
<i>because we've watched you</i>
<i>from season to season</i>

00:33:23.434 --> 00:33:25.136 line:95%,end
<i>to season get better</i>
<i>and better and better.</i>

00:33:25.203 --> 00:33:26.170 line:95%,end
<i>Does that feel good?</i>

00:33:26.237 --> 00:33:27.138 line:95%,end
NIA: <i>Definitely.</i>

00:33:27.205 --> 00:33:29.307 line:95%,end
JEFF: <i>So what do your friends</i>
<i>treat you like when you go to school?</i>

00:33:29.374 --> 00:33:32.744 line:95%,end
They treat me how any other friend
would treat me.

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:36.781 line:95%,end
So Mackenzie,
tell me what is the favorite part

00:33:36.848 --> 00:33:38.750 line:95%,end
about your makeup?

00:33:38.816 --> 00:33:41.185 line:95%,end
(chuckles) Lip gloss.

00:33:41.252 --> 00:33:43.154 line:95%,end
JEFF: Lip gloss.

00:33:43.221 --> 00:33:46.224 line:95%,end
All right, so next up,
I've got a question for Maddie.

00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:48.192 line:95%,end
What's your favorite part
about being on the show?

00:33:48.559 --> 00:33:51.029 line:95%,end
MADDIE: <i>Probably my favorite part</i>
<i>about being on the show</i>

00:33:51.095 --> 00:33:53.765 line:95%,end
<i>is learning a dance every week</i>
<i>and competing them.</i>

00:33:53.831 --> 00:33:55.633 line:95%,end
JEFF: Well, winning doesn't hurt,
either, does it?

00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:57.101 line:95%,end
(chuckles) No.

00:33:57.168 --> 00:33:59.504 line:95%,end
JEFF: (chuckles)
Tell me what your friends say.

00:34:00.138 --> 00:34:02.840 line:95%,end
Do they have a million questions
about what's it like and--

00:34:02.907 --> 00:34:04.575 line:95%,end
Sometimes the boys do.

00:34:04.642 --> 00:34:06.177 line:95%,end
JEFF: The boys do.

00:34:06.244 --> 00:34:08.946 line:95%,end
They're just looking
for a reason to talk to you.

00:34:09.013 --> 00:34:10.048 line:95%,end
JEFF: Ah.

00:34:10.114 --> 00:34:12.083 line:95%,end
So have you gotten a lot
more attention from the boys

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:13.484 line:95%,end
-now that you're on TV?
-Yes.

00:34:13.551 --> 00:34:15.153 line:95%,end
-JEFF: So Mom?
-MELISSA: Yes.

00:34:15.219 --> 00:34:16.821 line:95%,end
JEFF: When is Maddie allowed
to go on her first date?

00:34:16.888 --> 00:34:19.323 line:95%,end
-16
-JEFF: 16? Okay.

00:34:19.390 --> 00:34:21.459 line:95%,end
So is that like a date-date
or like a date

00:34:21.526 --> 00:34:23.261 line:95%,end
where they get to go
to the movies and--

00:34:23.327 --> 00:34:25.396 line:95%,end
-A date where...
-JEFF: What's the rule?

00:34:25.463 --> 00:34:27.065 line:95%,end
-...they could be at my house.
-JEFF: A date where Mom's in the back?

00:34:27.131 --> 00:34:29.033 line:95%,end
Yes, where I can be at the house.

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:30.768 line:95%,end
JEFF: A date where Mom
drives them to the date...

00:34:30.835 --> 00:34:32.070 line:95%,end
-Yes.
-JEFF: ...and Mom sits in the back row

00:34:32.136 --> 00:34:33.938 line:95%,end
-behind them.
-Yes, yes, yes.

00:34:34.005 --> 00:34:35.173 line:95%,end
All right, so Brooke.
Where's Brooke?

00:34:35.239 --> 00:34:36.541 line:95%,end
-Right here.
-All right, so Brooke,

00:34:36.607 --> 00:34:38.576 line:95%,end
are we going to hear
any more music from you?

00:34:38.643 --> 00:34:40.411 line:95%,end
Because we know
that you have a great voice.

00:34:40.478 --> 00:34:41.579 line:95%,end
We've heard you sing.

00:34:41.646 --> 00:34:42.914 line:95%,end
I really love singing.

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:45.083 line:95%,end
And I hope other people do, too.

00:34:45.149 --> 00:34:48.019 line:95%,end
And I just really would like
to get my voice out there.

00:34:48.086 --> 00:34:50.388 line:95%,end
Well, I think they're going to love it.
I mean, I've seen the music video,

00:34:50.455 --> 00:34:51.522 line:95%,end
and I think it's amazing.

00:34:52.423 --> 00:34:54.992 line:95%,end
<i>âª Spin that record 'round and 'round âª</i>

00:34:55.059 --> 00:34:57.895 line:95%,end
<i>âª 'Cause I can't get enough</i>
<i>of that summer sound âª</i>

00:34:57.962 --> 00:34:59.297 line:95%,end
Did you have a lot of fun doing that?

00:34:59.363 --> 00:35:01.099 line:95%,end
Yeah, it was such a good experience.

00:35:01.165 --> 00:35:02.867 line:95%,end
It was definitely something different.

00:35:02.934 --> 00:35:04.102 line:95%,end
-JEFF: Yeah.
-I really liked it.

00:35:04.168 --> 00:35:05.803 line:95%,end
What was the most fun about it?

00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:08.739 line:95%,end
I thought it was really cool
how we all got to dance on the streets

00:35:08.806 --> 00:35:12.243 line:95%,end
and on top of a tour bus and stuff.

00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:13.845 line:95%,end
-JEFF: Yeah, that was fun.
-Yeah.

00:35:13.911 --> 00:35:15.980 line:95%,end
-I've ridden that tour bus myself.
-(laughter)

00:35:16.047 --> 00:35:17.615 line:95%,end
All right, so, Paige, here's one for you.

00:35:17.682 --> 00:35:20.618 line:95%,end
What's the biggest lesson
Abby has taught you?

00:35:22.086 --> 00:35:23.221 line:95%,end
There's a lot of them.

00:35:24.755 --> 00:35:26.224 line:95%,end
JEFF: Well, what are the ones
you can talk about?

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:27.291 line:95%,end
Makeup tips.

00:35:27.358 --> 00:35:30.528 line:95%,end
When you do your eyeliner,
you have to start here and go in

00:35:30.595 --> 00:35:33.297 line:95%,end
because if not you'll get wrinkles.

00:35:33.364 --> 00:35:34.532 line:95%,end
JEFF: Oh.

00:35:34.599 --> 00:35:36.434 line:95%,end
And she taught us how to eat spaghetti,

00:35:36.501 --> 00:35:38.870 line:95%,end
how you have to roll it up on the fork,
then eat it.

00:35:38.936 --> 00:35:40.471 line:95%,end
-JEFF: Oh, okay.
-You can't just scoop it up.

00:35:40.538 --> 00:35:41.839 line:95%,end
JEFF:
Well, that's two really big lessons.

00:35:41.906 --> 00:35:43.341 line:95%,end
(laughter)

00:35:43.407 --> 00:35:45.543 line:95%,end
-So you--are you having fun?
-Did she teach you anything in dance?

00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:47.411 line:95%,end
JEFF: Yeah, anything about dance?

00:35:47.478 --> 00:35:49.947 line:95%,end
-Yes.
-JEFF: Of course.

00:35:50.014 --> 00:35:52.583 line:95%,end
All right, so, Chloe,
you have grown...

00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:55.119 line:95%,end
literally right before my eyes.

00:35:55.186 --> 00:35:57.288 line:95%,end
<i>I mean, from a little girl</i>


00:35:57.355 --> 00:35:59.690 line:95%,end
<i>into you're almost a lady now.</i>

00:35:59.757 --> 00:36:03.661 line:95%,end
And we've actually seen
you improve tremendously.

00:36:03.728 --> 00:36:06.430 line:95%,end
So where do you think
this confidence comes from?

00:36:06.497 --> 00:36:10.067 line:95%,end
Probably the music video
that I did last season.

00:36:10.134 --> 00:36:13.971 line:95%,end
And when we've won our groups
and when I've won my solos,

00:36:14.038 --> 00:36:16.574 line:95%,end
it just makes me feel

00:36:16.641 --> 00:36:18.676 line:95%,end
like I have accomplished a lot, so...

00:36:19.977 --> 00:36:21.179 line:95%,end
So listen, Kendall,

00:36:21.245 --> 00:36:24.882 line:95%,end
if you could dance with anyone
in the world, living or dead,

00:36:24.949 --> 00:36:26.117 line:95%,end
who would it be?

00:36:26.717 --> 00:36:28.452 line:95%,end
Michael Jackson maybe.

00:36:28.519 --> 00:36:30.188 line:95%,end
-JEFF: Michael Jackson?
-That's a good one.

00:36:30.254 --> 00:36:31.822 line:95%,end
-JEFF: That's a good one.
-That's a good one.

00:36:31.889 --> 00:36:33.457 line:95%,end
JEFF: Why Michael Jackson?

00:36:33.524 --> 00:36:38.029 line:95%,end
Because he can do really cool moves.

00:36:38.095 --> 00:36:41.532 line:95%,end
And I could probably do the moves
that he could do.

00:36:42.466 --> 00:36:45.269 line:95%,end
All right, so Vivian,
this is an easy one.

00:36:46.103 --> 00:36:48.105 line:95%,end
Who do you like better
as a dance teacher,

00:36:48.172 --> 00:36:50.474 line:95%,end
your mom or Abby Lee?

00:36:50.541 --> 00:36:53.077 line:95%,end
(laughter)

00:36:53.644 --> 00:36:55.513 line:95%,end
You can plead the fifth, baby.

00:36:56.914 --> 00:36:57.848 line:95%,end
My mom.

00:36:57.915 --> 00:36:59.584 line:95%,end
(laughter)

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:01.385 line:95%,end
KELLY:
She knows she better say that.

00:37:01.452 --> 00:37:03.221 line:95%,end
Right answer, kiddo.

00:37:04.088 --> 00:37:07.491 line:95%,end
So kids, ladies, moms,
you guys have been working really hard.

00:37:07.558 --> 00:37:09.093 line:95%,end
We've done a couple of seasons.

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:11.062 line:95%,end
You've been on the road now
for almost a year.

00:37:11.128 --> 00:37:12.930 line:95%,end
So what do you think about next year?

00:37:12.997 --> 00:37:15.533 line:95%,end
What do you hope to accomplish
next season, Maddie?

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:17.602 line:95%,end
-More crowns.
-JEFF: More crowns?

00:37:17.668 --> 00:37:18.502 line:95%,end
Yes.

00:37:18.569 --> 00:37:20.004 line:95%,end
JEFF: Mackenzie,
you've, like, blossomed.

00:37:20.071 --> 00:37:22.306 line:95%,end
I mean, you were like a little kid
when we started.

00:37:22.373 --> 00:37:23.708 line:95%,end
And now, you're like a real dancer.

00:37:23.774 --> 00:37:26.744 line:95%,end
The audience on Twitter,
they go nuts when you dance.

00:37:26.811 --> 00:37:28.312 line:95%,end
How does that feel?

00:37:28.379 --> 00:37:30.381 line:95%,end
-You're, like, a big girl dancer.
-Awesome.

00:37:30.448 --> 00:37:31.682 line:95%,end
JEFF: It feels awesome.

00:37:33.117 --> 00:37:35.419 line:95%,end
So Nia, do you have any big goals
for--for next season?

00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:37.355 line:95%,end
Definitely my back tuck.

00:37:37.421 --> 00:37:39.290 line:95%,end
JEFF: Your back tuck?

00:37:39.357 --> 00:37:40.992 line:95%,end
So Miss Abby is going to have
to work on that one?

00:37:41.058 --> 00:37:42.560 line:95%,end
-NIA: Yes.
-HOLLY: What about pointing your feet?

00:37:42.627 --> 00:37:44.028 line:95%,end
Oh, yeah, and pointing my feet.

00:37:44.095 --> 00:37:45.663 line:95%,end
JEFF: And pointing your feet.

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:46.897 line:95%,end
All right, so let's go over to this side.

00:37:46.964 --> 00:37:49.500 line:95%,end
So what do you want to accomplish
next season that you felt

00:37:49.567 --> 00:37:50.901 line:95%,end
like you didn't accomplish this season?

00:37:50.968 --> 00:37:53.304 line:95%,end
I would like to accomplish
my front aerial.

00:37:53.371 --> 00:37:54.605 line:95%,end
JEFF: Your front aerial?

00:37:54.672 --> 00:37:57.942 line:95%,end
So--so Miss Abby, how close is she
to--to accomplishing the front aerial?

00:37:58.009 --> 00:38:00.511 line:95%,end
She actually learned
her front aerial.

00:38:00.578 --> 00:38:02.513 line:95%,end
And I was right there.
I spotted her on it.

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:04.315 line:95%,end
She did it beautifully.

00:38:04.382 --> 00:38:06.951 line:95%,end
And then she pulled a muscle in her leg,

00:38:07.018 --> 00:38:08.919 line:95%,end
like, the next day
and couldn't do it anymore.

00:38:08.986 --> 00:38:10.488 line:95%,end
So I think we're real close.

00:38:10.554 --> 00:38:11.956 line:95%,end
So you're--you're going to get it?

00:38:12.023 --> 00:38:12.957 line:95%,end
-ABBY: Yes.
-Definitely.

00:38:13.024 --> 00:38:14.158 line:95%,end
JEFF: All right,
we're going to be looking for that.

00:38:14.225 --> 00:38:15.660 line:95%,end
And Jill, what do you hope that

00:38:15.726 --> 00:38:17.695 line:95%,end
she's able to accomplish next season?

00:38:17.762 --> 00:38:20.364 line:95%,end
I hope she just continues to grow

00:38:20.431 --> 00:38:22.433 line:95%,end
as quickly as she grew this year.

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:26.037 line:95%,end
And I hope she gets lots of solos,
lots of group dances.

00:38:26.103 --> 00:38:28.906 line:95%,end
I like the competitive part of dance.

00:38:28.973 --> 00:38:31.008 line:95%,end
I think that's how they grow.

00:38:31.075 --> 00:38:32.910 line:95%,end
Well, one of the things
that we've all seen

00:38:32.977 --> 00:38:35.579 line:95%,end
throughout the seasons
is that you guys have definitely become

00:38:35.646 --> 00:38:37.848 line:95%,end
much better dancers since we started.

00:38:37.915 --> 00:38:40.351 line:95%,end
And we can't wait to see
where you go from here.

00:38:40.418 --> 00:38:42.119 line:95%,end
So Kelly, what do you got planned?
What's--

00:38:42.186 --> 00:38:44.922 line:95%,end
Our family has a lot of thinking

00:38:44.989 --> 00:38:47.291 line:95%,end
and communicating to do

00:38:47.358 --> 00:38:49.627 line:95%,end
to figure out what we want to do
before next season starts.

00:38:49.694 --> 00:38:50.961 line:95%,end
Yeah. So you got to decide
whether or not

00:38:51.028 --> 00:38:52.663 line:95%,end
-you're going to come back or not, right?
-Mm-hmm.

00:38:53.831 --> 00:38:55.299 line:95%,end
JEFF: Well, we hope to see you again.

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:57.902 line:95%,end
-We'll see.
-JEFF: All right.

00:38:57.968 --> 00:38:59.270 line:95%,end
We have some raised hands over here.

00:38:59.337 --> 00:39:00.638 line:5%,start
Oh, we have some hands over here.

00:39:00.705 --> 00:39:01.906 line:5%,start
So what--what did you have?

00:39:01.972 --> 00:39:03.808 line:5%,start
What's on your necklace?

00:39:04.508 --> 00:39:05.810 line:5%,start
These skulls?

00:39:06.544 --> 00:39:09.447 line:5%,start
They're all the mothers
that didn't listen.

00:39:09.513 --> 00:39:12.516 line:5%,start
(laughter)

00:39:12.583 --> 00:39:14.352 line:5%,start
I could name them one at a time.

00:39:15.486 --> 00:39:17.088 line:5%,start
All right, thank you so much.

00:39:17.154 --> 00:39:18.222 line:5%,start
What a year it's been.

00:39:18.289 --> 00:39:20.024 line:5%,start
Thank you, ladies.
Thank you, young ladies.

00:39:20.091 --> 00:39:21.959 line:5%,start
The best of luck to all of you.

00:39:22.026 --> 00:39:23.227 line:5%,start
I'm Jeff Collins.

00:39:23.294 --> 00:39:24.362 line:5%,start
Good night, everybody.

00:39:24.428 --> 00:39:25.863 line:5%,start
And we'll see you again next year.
