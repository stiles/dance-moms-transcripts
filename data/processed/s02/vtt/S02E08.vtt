<i>Previously on </i>Dance Moms...

00:00:02.802 --> 00:00:06.339 line:5%,start
You're going to be using guns
in your routine.

00:00:06.406 --> 00:00:07.540 line:5%,start
<i>I want you to kill it.</i>

00:00:07.607 --> 00:00:10.744 line:5%,start
We're going to play a little bench
in front of the dance studio.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:11.978 line:5%,start
Beautiful.

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:13.279 line:5%,start
You know everyone's
going to hate you?

00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:14.814 line:5%,start
You're a conniving bitch.

00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:16.683 line:5%,start
Eight means eight.
Not nine and a half, not ten.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:17.650 line:5%,start
Eight.

00:00:17.717 --> 00:00:19.619 line:5%,start
You should be so lucky
to have Chloe as your student,

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:20.787 line:5%,start
because she's a great dancer.

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:22.789 line:5%,start
Everybody knows
it except for you.

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:25.492 line:5%,start
ABBY: If that kid loved to dance,
she'd have remembered that trio.

00:00:25.558 --> 00:00:27.861 line:5%,start
You always got to keep
your options open.

ABBY: <i>Coming up on </i>Dance Moms...

Kendall, you are back on probation.

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:35.535 line:5%,start
There's a lot of studios out there
who would love what she does.

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:38.104 line:5%,start
We're going
to one of those studio.

00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:40.540 line:5%,start
Do Abby and the moms
know you came here?

00:00:40.607 --> 00:00:41.841 line:5%,start
They have no idea.

ABBY: <i>Nia,</i>
<i>you've worked hard in ballet class,</i>

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:45.879 line:5%,start
<i>you've waited a long time</i>

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:47.113 line:5%,start
Don't screw it up, kid.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.384 line:5%,start
<i>She's doing my routine</i>
<i>with my costume.</i>

00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:55.121 line:5%,start
I wouldn't want
to steal your choreography. Really?

00:00:55.188 --> 00:00:57.390 line:5%,start
ABBY: <i>Don't carry it</i>
<i>into the dressing room.</i>

00:00:57.457 --> 00:00:59.726 line:5%,start
<i>You go home,</i>

ABBY: Let's go girls.
Get in here, shake the lead out.

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:23.917 line:95%,end
Okay.
Now Hollywood Vibe last week.

00:01:23.983 --> 00:01:26.519 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:29.756 line:95%,end
You did an okay job.
I thought it could have been better.

00:01:29.823 --> 00:01:31.691 line:95%,end
Moving on.

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:35.528 line:95%,end
This week,
we are going to Fire and Ice

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:37.130 line:95%,end
right here in Pittsburgh.

00:01:37.197 --> 00:01:39.632 line:95%,end
(clapping)

00:01:39.699 --> 00:01:42.168 line:95%,end
And I have
a reputation to uphold.

00:01:42.235 --> 00:01:46.639 line:95%,end
It's much more difficult to walk in
and compete against people you know

00:01:46.706 --> 00:01:48.007 line:95%,end
than a bunch of strangers.

00:01:49.342 --> 00:01:50.510 line:95%,end
Okay.

00:01:50.577 --> 00:01:52.312 line:95%,end
Let's get to the pyramid.

00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:55.081 line:95%,end
I hate to do this, but...

00:01:57.417 --> 00:01:59.586 line:95%,end
Kendall,

00:01:59.652 --> 00:02:01.287 line:95%,end
you are back on probation.

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:06.192 line:95%,end
JILL: That's ridiculous, Abby.

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.229 line:95%,end
What more do you want from her?

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:11.498 line:95%,end
ABBY: Your head is distended,

00:02:11.564 --> 00:02:14.767 line:95%,end
your shoulders are hunched,
your rib cage is open.

00:02:14.834 --> 00:02:16.202 line:95%,end
Are you kidding me?

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:17.570 line:95%,end
You're kidding me, right?

00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:19.139 line:95%,end
ABBY: No.

00:02:19.205 --> 00:02:21.708 line:95%,end
She doesn't make the corrections.

00:02:21.774 --> 00:02:25.812 line:95%,end
I have been telling her
since the audition about her posture,

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.514 line:95%,end
and it has not improved once.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.149 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>Jill, careful what you wish for.</i>

00:02:29.215 --> 00:02:31.618 line:5%,start
You're always demanding
more special parts and attention

00:02:31.684 --> 00:02:33.653 line:5%,start
for Kendall
while you're back on probation.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.754 line:95%,end
So you got it.

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:36.556 line:95%,end
JILL: I can't even believe it.
You know what?

00:02:36.623 --> 00:02:40.360 line:95%,end
You should be on probation
not my daughter.

00:02:40.426 --> 00:02:41.761 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>Kendall was on the bottom</i>
<i>of the pyramid.</i>

00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:45.298 line:5%,start
Unfortunately,
I don't have a picture of Jill.

00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:47.967 line:95%,end
If I would,
she would be the one that's there.

00:02:48.034 --> 00:02:49.903 line:95%,end
<i>Learn something, Jill.</i>

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:51.638 line:95%,end
You are on my last nerve.

00:02:51.704 --> 00:02:53.673 line:95%,end
I don't even know why I'm here.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.276 line:95%,end
You had nothing nice to say to her

00:02:56.342 --> 00:02:58.178 line:95%,end
since the second we got here!

00:02:58.244 --> 00:02:59.212 line:95%,end
You know what, Abby?

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:00.780 line:95%,end
She does a lot right.

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:02.081 line:95%,end
ABBY: She turns like a top.

00:03:03.082 --> 00:03:05.051 line:95%,end
But that's what's good.

00:03:05.118 --> 00:03:06.419 line:95%,end
I don't need to fix that.

00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:10.723 line:95%,end
I was not surprised
in the least by Jill's reaction.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.727 line:95%,end
I was devastated
by Kendall's reaction.

00:03:14.794 --> 00:03:17.530 line:95%,end
<i>I certainly don't wake up</i>
<i>in the morning</i>

00:03:17.597 --> 00:03:20.400 line:95%,end
<i>to intentionally hurt a child's feelings.</i>

00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:22.135 line:95%,end
There's a lot of studios out there

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:24.504 line:95%,end
who would love
what she does right.

00:03:24.571 --> 00:03:26.072 line:95%,end
And you know what, Abby?

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:27.240 line:95%,end
ABBY: I hear that.

00:03:27.307 --> 00:03:29.676 line:95%,end
We're going
to one of those studios.

00:03:29.742 --> 00:03:32.312 line:95%,end
I'm not putting up
with this crap anymore.


00:03:32.378 --> 00:03:33.846 line:95%,end
We're done.

00:03:33.913 --> 00:03:35.081 line:95%,end
That's it.

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:38.952 line:95%,end
You know what, honey?
She doesn't appreciate you.

00:03:39.018 --> 00:03:41.721 line:95%,end
I'll take you
where someone appreciates you.

00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:44.424 line:95%,end
It makes me sick to think

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:45.925 line:95%,end
that Abby would do this

00:03:45.992 --> 00:03:48.461 line:95%,end
to a little girl
who is working so hard.

00:03:48.528 --> 00:03:52.398 line:95%,end
We'll go where they will treat you
with respect,

00:03:52.465 --> 00:03:54.200 line:95%,end
they'll give you great numbers,

00:03:54.267 --> 00:03:56.603 line:95%,end
they might even let you do a solo or two.

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:58.771 line:95%,end
This is disgusting to me,

00:03:58.838 --> 00:04:01.407 line:95%,end
<i>and I'm not putting up</i>
<i>with it anymore.</i>

00:04:01.474 --> 00:04:02.475 line:95%,end
It's over.

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.612 line:95%,end
KENDALL:
I don't want to go, I love to dance.

00:04:09.616 --> 00:04:12.352 line:95%,end
ABBY: Next, Paige.

00:04:13.353 --> 00:04:17.023 line:95%,end
You were on the top,
now you're obviously not.

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.691 line:95%,end
You couldn't remember the trio.

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:21.961 line:95%,end
SINGER: <i>âªOver and overâª</i>

00:04:22.028 --> 00:04:24.364 line:95%,end
<i>âªKnow this is trueâª</i>

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.965 line:95%,end
ABBY: Unacceptable.

00:04:26.032 --> 00:04:27.233 line:95%,end
Next.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.434 line:95%,end
Brooke.

00:04:28.501 --> 00:04:34.140 line:95%,end
Brooke, this whiny, mopey,
teenager crap has to stop.

00:04:34.207 --> 00:04:35.441 line:95%,end
You are the role model.

00:04:35.508 --> 00:04:36.676 line:95%,end
Do me a favor,

00:04:36.743 --> 00:04:37.844 line:95%,end
just smile.

00:04:40.713 --> 00:04:45.385 line:95%,end
Mackenzie,
the tricks are stronger, they're better.

00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:48.454 line:95%,end
But you need a few ballet classes.

00:04:48.521 --> 00:04:50.623 line:95%,end
Next we have Chloe.

00:04:51.991 --> 00:04:55.295 line:95%,end
Once again,
nice, clean performance.

00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:57.397 line:95%,end
Maddie, you redeemed yourself.

00:04:58.598 --> 00:05:00.066 line:95%,end
No stupid mistakes.

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:02.535 line:95%,end
Maddie and Chloe,
you know, neck and neck,

00:05:02.602 --> 00:05:04.570 line:95%,end
<i>same old story different day.</i>

00:05:04.637 --> 00:05:07.307 line:95%,end
ABBY:
And deservedly so for the first...

00:05:07.373 --> 00:05:08.608 line:95%,end
(squealing)

00:05:08.675 --> 00:05:11.044 line:95%,end
ABBY:
Nia is on top of the pyramid.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.379 line:95%,end
HOLLY: <i>It's been a long time coming.</i>

00:05:13.446 --> 00:05:15.515 line:5%,start
I didn't think
I would ever live to see this day.

00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:17.483 line:95%,end
ABBY:
You were on top of this pyramid

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.721 line:95%,end
because of your hard work
and your determination all week long.

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:26.392 line:95%,end
To me, that's sometimes
more important than any trophy.

00:05:27.493 --> 00:05:28.494 line:95%,end
And you shined.

00:05:28.561 --> 00:05:30.697 line:95%,end
Your mother isn't always here,

00:05:30.763 --> 00:05:33.132 line:95%,end
but she does make sure that you're here.

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:35.001 line:95%,end
And you can see the improvement.

00:05:35.068 --> 00:05:37.837 line:95%,end
NIA: <i>I'm very happy I'm on the top</i>
<i>of the pyramid this week.</i>

00:05:37.904 --> 00:05:38.971 line:5%,start
Yay.

00:05:39.038 --> 00:05:42.208 line:95%,end
ABBY: This week,
you're going to be doing a solo.

00:05:43.476 --> 00:05:48.181 line:95%,end
Holly, she's going to perform,
act, and look like a princess.

00:05:48.247 --> 00:05:51.784 line:95%,end
Like I tell everybody else,
it's tough getting here,

00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:53.820 line:95%,end
it's even more difficult to stay here.

00:05:55.088 --> 00:05:56.622 line:95%,end
Moving on to the group number.

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:58.858 line:95%,end
We are going to do a dance.

00:05:58.925 --> 00:06:01.627 line:95%,end
It's called Head Over Heels.

00:06:01.694 --> 00:06:06.733 line:95%,end
It's about falling in love
and getting married.

00:06:06.799 --> 00:06:09.435 line:95%,end
As an artist,
I draw my inspiration

00:06:09.502 --> 00:06:11.237 line:95%,end
from the world around me.

00:06:11.304 --> 00:06:15.141 line:95%,end
And I think that Melissa
has a little secret.

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:19.045 line:95%,end
So hopefully
once she sees this number,

00:06:19.112 --> 00:06:22.248 line:95%,end
<i>she's going to realize</i>
<i>that everybody knows her secret.</i>

00:06:22.315 --> 00:06:23.282 line:95%,end
Yes?

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:24.951 line:95%,end
Aren't I too young to get married?

00:06:25.017 --> 00:06:26.319 line:95%,end
(laughter)

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:30.390 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I just got engaged, but I like
to keep my private life private.

00:06:30.456 --> 00:06:32.625 line:95%,end
ABBY: You're going to be dressed
as brides,

00:06:32.692 --> 00:06:37.196 line:95%,end
so I want your dads
to be at the competition

00:06:37.263 --> 00:06:39.699 line:95%,end
as if they were giving
their daughters away.

00:06:39.766 --> 00:06:41.334 line:95%,end
All right, you're dismissed.
Thank you very much.

00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:43.803 line:95%,end
Girls, when outside
triple ballet pirouette.

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.239 line:95%,end
That's what I want to see,
it's in the number.

00:06:46.305 --> 00:06:49.342 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:06:52.311 --> 00:06:56.349 line:5%,start
ABBY: Five, six, seven...

00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:58.518 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I freaking can't believe
what just happened with Jill.

00:06:58.584 --> 00:07:00.253 line:95%,end
I think Jill's going back
to her old studio.

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:01.387 line:95%,end
-No!
-Yeah.

00:07:01.454 --> 00:07:02.422 line:95%,end
Oh, I do too.

00:07:02.488 --> 00:07:04.157 line:95%,end
And I also think
that she's going to go back there,


00:07:04.223 --> 00:07:05.858 line:95%,end
and she's going to kind of dish the dirt.

00:07:05.925 --> 00:07:07.827 line:95%,end
And I think
that we're going to run into them.

00:07:07.894 --> 00:07:10.029 line:95%,end
I wouldn't be surprised
if we run into them soon.

MELISSA: <i>I feel horrible for Jill.</i>

00:07:11.631 --> 00:07:14.534 line:5%,start
It's hard being a dance mom
and making these tough decisions.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.302 line:5%,start
I hope she comes back.

00:07:16.369 --> 00:07:17.503 line:95%,end
I'm not all that shocked.

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:19.705 line:95%,end
Jill didn't really bond with us.

00:07:19.772 --> 00:07:21.574 line:95%,end
Kendall I thought
fit the group very well.

00:07:21.641 --> 00:07:23.743 line:95%,end
And I thought Kendall
is a good little dancer.

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:25.645 line:95%,end
-She held her own.
-Yeah, I think she holds her own.

00:07:25.711 --> 00:07:28.347 line:95%,end
I think Jill's going to regret
walking out of there.

00:07:28.414 --> 00:07:31.050 line:95%,end
It was like a spur of the moment,
like, I'm pissed off, I'm leaving.

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:33.419 line:95%,end
Well, she can't come back now after that.

00:07:33.486 --> 00:07:35.021 line:95%,end
Well, I'm kind of disappointed
she didn't get a chance

00:07:35.087 --> 00:07:36.923 line:95%,end
to see Nia at the top of the pyramid
after she talked about...

00:07:36.989 --> 00:07:38.391 line:95%,end
I know.

00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:40.159 line:95%,end
I'm really kind of disappointed
about that.

00:07:40.226 --> 00:07:43.329 line:95%,end
She kept saying that she'd never
pretty much amount to that.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:48.167 line:5%,start
ABBY: Open.
Big rich, big rich, and in.

00:07:48.234 --> 00:07:49.268 line:95%,end
Stop jump.

00:07:50.736 --> 00:07:51.737 line:95%,end
Slide.

00:07:53.105 --> 00:07:56.642 line:95%,end
This week I'm doing a solo
called I'll Do Anything For You.

00:07:56.709 --> 00:07:58.411 line:95%,end
<i>It's an acro routine,</i>

00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:02.815 line:95%,end

00:08:02.882 --> 00:08:04.617 line:95%,end
And I'm just really excited.

MELISSA: I'm so excited about Nia.
Did you see the girls?

00:08:16.095 --> 00:08:17.163 line:95%,end
Oh.

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:19.098 line:95%,end
As soon as she wasn't on the last row.

00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:21.234 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I know. Not even that she was
at the top of the pyramid.

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:22.502 line:95%,end
You know what I was excited for?

00:08:22.568 --> 00:08:24.070 line:95%,end
The kids were doing an ethnic dance?

00:08:24.136 --> 00:08:26.606 line:95%,end
That's right. Exactly.

00:08:26.672 --> 00:08:28.274 line:95%,end
Nia, listen.

00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:31.210 line:95%,end
You've worked hard,
you've worked hard in ballet class,

00:08:31.277 --> 00:08:33.946 line:95%,end
you've waited a long time
for this pretty dance with me,

00:08:34.013 --> 00:08:36.716 line:95%,end
and I'll tell you what,
don't screw it up, kid.

00:08:36.782 --> 00:08:38.284 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Melissa, you have to be upset.

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:41.053 line:95%,end
I mean you were friends--
you are friends with Jill.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.256 line:95%,end
And you guys were like buddies.

00:08:43.322 --> 00:08:44.257 line:95%,end
I am upset.

00:08:44.323 --> 00:08:46.726 line:95%,end
I mean, you know,
I just think it's the wrong decision.

00:08:46.792 --> 00:08:48.794 line:95%,end
HOLLY: I don't how you make
that snap decision like that.

00:08:48.861 --> 00:08:50.062 line:95%,end
I think she'll be back.

00:08:50.129 --> 00:08:53.199 line:95%,end
Jill didn't mean it,
she doesn't want to leave, she'll be back.

00:08:53.266 --> 00:08:56.335 line:95%,end
I'm going to try to call Jill and see...

00:08:56.402 --> 00:08:57.737 line:95%,end
Poor Kendall was upset.

00:08:57.803 --> 00:08:59.539 line:95%,end
HOLLY: She was upset.
She was crying.

00:08:59.605 --> 00:09:01.807 line:95%,end
I hate to see a kid cry.

00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:05.478 line:95%,end
Oh, my God, she sent me a text.

00:09:06.579 --> 00:09:07.513 line:95%,end
What she say?

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:10.783 line:95%,end
Kendall and I deserve better,
I'm not coming back.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:12.251 line:95%,end
Sorry to leave you to the wolves.

00:09:12.318 --> 00:09:15.121 line:95%,end
I just don't want this for K.
I'm going back to my old studio

00:09:15.187 --> 00:09:16.722 line:95%,end
where they like Kendall.

00:09:16.789 --> 00:09:17.857 line:95%,end
No, she didn't say that.

00:09:17.924 --> 00:09:19.959 line:95%,end
I told you she was going back there.

00:09:20.026 --> 00:09:22.094 line:95%,end
HOLLY: It didn't take her long
to make that decision.

00:09:22.161 --> 00:09:24.664 line:95%,end
-No.
-That was fast.

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:27.567 line:95%,end
Hello, let's call a spade a spade,
she's a studio hopper,

00:09:27.633 --> 00:09:29.368 line:95%,end
so it's time to hop back to the old one.

00:09:29.435 --> 00:09:31.003 line:95%,end
You know what? Frankly,

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:34.106 line:95%,end
I don't want somebody like that
around us and our kids.

00:09:34.173 --> 00:09:35.808 line:95%,end
So I say good riddance.

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:39.579 line:95%,end
(dramatic music playing)

00:09:39.645 --> 00:09:42.582 line:95%,end
Listen, Kendall.
I'm not putting up with this crap anymore.

00:09:42.648 --> 00:09:45.651 line:95%,end
I can't have you at a place
that doesn't appreciate you

00:09:45.718 --> 00:09:47.653 line:95%,end
and all they do is tear you down.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.089 line:95%,end
That probation is ridiculous.

00:09:50.156 --> 00:09:52.058 line:95%,end
You did nothing wrong.

00:09:52.124 --> 00:09:55.494 line:95%,end
It was my fault, she should put me
on probation not you.

00:09:55.561 --> 00:09:57.296 line:95%,end
Were done at Abby's.

00:09:57.363 --> 00:10:00.199 line:95%,end
I'm taking you somewhere
where they are going to appreciate you.

00:10:02.001 --> 00:10:05.271 line:95%,end
-This is Jill Vertes from Abby's?
-DANCE TEACHER: <i>Uh-huh?</i>

00:10:05.338 --> 00:10:07.940 line:95%,end
I'm fed up with Abby,
I can't go back there.

00:10:08.007 --> 00:10:09.775 line:95%,end
And I really need a dance studio

00:10:09.842 --> 00:10:11.544 line:95%,end
where they're going to train my child.

00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:15.381 line:95%,end
I was wondering
if you could take a look at Kendall

00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:17.516 line:95%,end
and tell me
what you think of her talents.

00:10:17.583 --> 00:10:20.519 line:95%,end
And if you could find
a place for her on your team.

00:10:20.586 --> 00:10:23.089 line:95%,end
DANCE TEACHER:
<i>If you want to come to Candy Apple's</i>

00:10:23.155 --> 00:10:24.523 line:95%,end

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:27.593 line:95%,end
<i>But I need to be 100% sure</i>

Hip down, hip down.

Five, four--come on, straighten that knee.

Three, two, one.

00:10:45.745 --> 00:10:47.546 line:95%,end
And finish. Other side.

-I heard about the engagement.
-(giggling)

00:10:51.417 --> 00:10:52.718 line:95%,end
So are you going to be in the wedding?

00:10:54.787 --> 00:10:56.288 line:95%,end
Do you think
I'm going to be in the wedding?

00:10:58.457 --> 00:11:01.427 line:95%,end
My mom is engaged,
but she wants to keep it quiet.

-Chloe, work on your solo.
-Okay.

00:11:03.863 --> 00:11:05.531 line:95%,end
Maddie, same thing,
work on your solo.

00:11:05.598 --> 00:11:06.799 line:95%,end
Think about the corrections.

00:11:06.866 --> 00:11:10.369 line:95%,end
You should work on your pirouettes

00:11:10.436 --> 00:11:12.004 line:95%,end
and your (indistinct) turns.

00:11:12.071 --> 00:11:13.606 line:95%,end
Okey doke, all right.

00:11:13.673 --> 00:11:15.274 line:95%,end
Let's everybody get
to where we need to be.

I can't believe you're not
more excited about the wedding.

Beautiful.

00:11:24.884 --> 00:11:26.786 line:95%,end
I love the story.

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:32.825 line:95%,end
We weren't even
supposed to talk about it.

You're lying.

We're not supposed

She's a blabbermouth.

-No, seriously. I don't know the story.
-You don't know the story?

00:11:48.307 --> 00:11:50.309 line:95%,end
What's Chloe? She's a weirdo.
What's she making up?

00:11:50.376 --> 00:11:51.911 line:95%,end
MACKENZIE: I don't know
what story they're talking about.

-Kenz, come on.

00:11:55.314 --> 00:11:57.283 line:95%,end
Tell Chloe I want the story, come here.

Abby wants the story.

I actually like this one.

So the moms and I
went to Babbette's bridal shop

00:12:09.962 --> 00:12:13.566 line:95%,end
so we could get some inspiration
for this bridal dance that we're doing.

00:12:13.632 --> 00:12:16.035 line:95%,end
Are we doing long dance
for the girls or short nails?

00:12:16.102 --> 00:12:17.670 line:95%,end
I want somebody
to try this one on.

00:12:19.705 --> 00:12:22.575 line:5%,start
Um, we got awfully sidetracked.
(giggles)

00:12:22.641 --> 00:12:25.711 line:95%,end
CHRISTI That is a poofy, poofy dress.

00:12:25.778 --> 00:12:27.646 line:95%,end
Is that a wedding dress?

00:12:27.713 --> 00:12:29.648 line:95%,end
-I'm assuming.

00:12:35.387 --> 00:12:39.091 line:95%,end
It was me, my mom, my sister,
and my grandmother,

00:12:39.158 --> 00:12:41.560 line:95%,end
and the first dress I came out in...

00:12:41.627 --> 00:12:43.062 line:95%,end
-That, was that it?
-I bought it.

00:12:43.129 --> 00:12:44.563 line:95%,end
Well, personally,
if I got married again,

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:46.031 line:95%,end
I wouldn't be wearing
a big wedding gown.

00:12:46.098 --> 00:12:47.967 line:95%,end
-No? You wouldn't do that?
-Nope.

00:12:48.033 --> 00:12:50.269 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Oh, no, somebody try that one on.
I like that one over there.

00:12:50.336 --> 00:12:52.438 line:95%,end
I used to get excited
when I looked at wedding dresses.

00:12:52.505 --> 00:12:53.773 line:95%,end
I really don't anymore.

CHRISTI: <i>Why are you lying?</i>

00:12:55.274 --> 00:12:58.043 line:95%,end
We all know you're engaged,
so why don't you just admit it?

00:12:58.110 --> 00:12:59.311 line:95%,end
You wanna go first?

00:13:00.713 --> 00:13:02.414 line:95%,end
-I don't have any underwear.

Welcome to my world, no panties.

A fat one!

Me neither,

CHRISTI: You look skinny.

00:13:16.262 --> 00:13:18.063 line:95%,end
You look really skinny in that.

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:19.465 line:95%,end
Because it hides your butt.

00:13:21.033 --> 00:13:22.201 line:95%,end
Just kidding.

00:13:22.268 --> 00:13:25.504 line:95%,end
She wants to get married again,
and she wants a big rock.

That's right.

00:13:26.705 --> 00:13:28.474 line:95%,end
Maybe you should renew your vowels.

Vowels? (laughs)

00:13:30.075 --> 00:13:32.778 line:95%,end

will you marry me again?

But Melissa, you're the one

of getting married again.

00:13:37.216 --> 00:13:39.552 line:95%,end
-Not me.
-MELISSA: I'm not wearing a wedding dress.

00:13:39.618 --> 00:13:41.587 line:95%,end
I don't know, I think
if I was getting married again,

00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:43.122 line:95%,end
I'd have to have the birth thing.

00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:45.324 line:95%,end
I like the birdcage too.

00:13:45.391 --> 00:13:46.458 line:95%,end
Yeah, to hide your wrinkles?

00:13:46.525 --> 00:13:47.827 line:95%,end
Oh, no she didn't.

00:13:47.893 --> 00:13:49.995 line:95%,end
(laughter)

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:54.133 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:14:02.308 --> 00:14:03.542 line:95%,end
Here we are.

00:14:03.609 --> 00:14:05.911 line:5%,start
I'm a little nervous
to join the Candy Apples.

00:14:05.978 --> 00:14:08.848 line:5%,start
I haven't really seen their studio,

00:14:08.914 --> 00:14:12.685 line:95%,end
<i>but I want to dance at a place</i>
<i>where they actually respect me</i>

00:14:12.751 --> 00:14:14.453 line:95%,end
<i>and they like me as a dancer.</i>

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:15.754 line:95%,end
Hi.

00:14:15.821 --> 00:14:17.323 line:95%,end
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:19.859 line:95%,end
When Jill called
and wanted to bring Kendall

00:14:19.925 --> 00:14:22.228 line:95%,end
over to the dance studio, I was thrilled.

00:14:22.294 --> 00:14:23.562 line:95%,end
I mean, why wouldn't I be?

00:14:23.629 --> 00:14:24.930 line:95%,end
It's a win-win situation.

00:14:24.997 --> 00:14:27.032 line:95%,end
-You're not nervous are you?
-No.

00:14:27.099 --> 00:14:28.367 line:95%,end
Oh, maybe a little,
but that's okay.

00:14:28.434 --> 00:14:29.468 line:95%,end
That's normal.

00:14:29.535 --> 00:14:30.636 line:95%,end
Don't be nervous, don't be nervous.

00:14:30.703 --> 00:14:32.238 line:95%,end
-You'll get over that.
-You don't have to be nervous.

00:14:32.304 --> 00:14:33.639 line:95%,end
So come on, let's go.

00:14:33.706 --> 00:14:35.574 line:95%,end
They're actually having
acro class right now.

00:14:35.641 --> 00:14:37.042 line:95%,end
Should we take our shoes off?

00:14:37.109 --> 00:14:38.644 line:95%,end
In our studio?

00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:41.247 line:95%,end
Oh, honey, we have a cleaning lady
that cleans the floor every night.

00:14:41.313 --> 00:14:42.781 line:95%,end
-We don't need to worry about it.
-All right.

00:14:42.848 --> 00:14:44.283 line:95%,end
No screaming
and yelling about that here.

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:45.985 line:95%,end
-May I come?
-The cleaning lady comes every night.

00:14:46.051 --> 00:14:46.952 line:95%,end
All right.

00:14:47.019 --> 00:14:49.488 line:95%,end
<i>Kendall misses her friends</i>
<i>back at Abby's.</i>

00:14:49.555 --> 00:14:52.258 line:5%,start
I had to explain to her
why this was a good decision

00:14:52.324 --> 00:14:55.828 line:5%,start
to bring her out here,
because Cathy is going to give her

00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:59.865 line:95%,end
what she needs
and what she wants to be a good dancer.

00:14:59.932 --> 00:15:01.333 line:95%,end
Looking to join our company?

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:05.437 line:95%,end
I need a studio, I need a group of kids
she can dance with.

00:15:05.504 --> 00:15:08.807 line:95%,end
Oh, okay, so you're coming here
under the assumption


00:15:08.874 --> 00:15:11.944 line:95%,end
that you you might want
to just go ahead and join with us?

00:15:12.011 --> 00:15:13.445 line:95%,end
-JILL: Absolutely.
-And become an apple?

00:15:13.512 --> 00:15:15.648 line:95%,end
-I need a studio.
-CATHY: Fine.

00:15:15.714 --> 00:15:19.785 line:95%,end
Cathy takes a look at Kendall,
she sees her potential right away,

00:15:19.852 --> 00:15:21.854 line:95%,end
<i>she sees</i>
<i>what this little girl can do,</i>

00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:25.124 line:95%,end
<i>what she can bring</i>
<i>to a solo or group number.</i>

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:27.459 line:95%,end
This is great.
This is exactly what I needed.

00:15:27.526 --> 00:15:29.862 line:95%,end
CATHY: A little something
that we're doing this weekend,

00:15:29.929 --> 00:15:31.964 line:95%,end
and I don't want to put
any pressure on you whatsoever.

00:15:32.031 --> 00:15:34.300 line:95%,end
I have an adorable little solo
that I think

00:15:34.366 --> 00:15:36.101 line:95%,end
would be very fitting for her.

00:15:36.168 --> 00:15:39.905 line:95%,end
And the funny thing
about it is, dare I say,

00:15:39.972 --> 00:15:41.240 line:95%,end
we're going to go to Pittsburgh.

00:15:41.307 --> 00:15:43.475 line:95%,end
This week's Fire and Ice competition

00:15:43.542 --> 00:15:45.844 line:95%,end
just got a little bit more interesting.

00:15:45.911 --> 00:15:49.448 line:95%,end
That'll give you an opportunity
to just join in and be with us

00:15:49.515 --> 00:15:51.016 line:95%,end
even though
you won't be in a group number.

00:15:51.083 --> 00:15:53.719 line:95%,end
Cathy gives Kendall
a solo right off the bat.

00:15:53.786 --> 00:15:57.456 line:95%,end
This was Cathy's way of telling me
that she appreciates me

00:15:57.523 --> 00:16:00.693 line:95%,end
<i>and my daughter,</i>
<i>she has respect for us,</i>

00:16:00.759 --> 00:16:02.995 line:95%,end
and she knows
that Kendall is a good dancer.

00:16:03.062 --> 00:16:04.330 line:95%,end
This is good.

00:16:05.464 --> 00:16:07.499 line:95%,end
(uplifting music playing)

00:16:09.101 --> 00:16:12.905 line:5%,start
ABBY: And one,
hit two, hit three, hit four.

00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:14.606 line:5%,start
Give me something.
Come on, girls.

00:16:14.673 --> 00:16:17.643 line:5%,start
We do a lot of contemporary lyrical
in competitions,

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:20.612 line:5%,start
because that's like
the biggest fad right now.

00:16:20.679 --> 00:16:24.717 line:95%,end
<i>But it's nice</i>
<i>to also do some novelty numbers.</i>

00:16:24.783 --> 00:16:28.620 line:95%,end
And Head Over Heels is a novelty routine.

00:16:28.687 --> 00:16:31.256 line:95%,end
SINGER: <i>âªI love you,</i>
<i>I love you, I love youâª</i>

00:16:31.323 --> 00:16:32.257 line:95%,end
Great.

00:16:32.324 --> 00:16:33.425 line:95%,end
-What's going on?
-That's good.

00:16:33.492 --> 00:16:34.526 line:95%,end
They're just practicing.

00:16:34.593 --> 00:16:36.395 line:95%,end
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:16:36.462 --> 00:16:37.863 line:95%,end
Hey, what you up to?

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:39.231 line:95%,end
What's on Mackenzie's top?
Are those bats?

00:16:39.298 --> 00:16:41.867 line:95%,end
-They're puppies.
-They look like bats from here.

00:16:41.934 --> 00:16:43.235 line:95%,end
Don't cross your fingers.

00:16:43.302 --> 00:16:45.037 line:95%,end
Oh, those hands.

00:16:46.605 --> 00:16:48.307 line:95%,end
Who's your manicurist?

00:16:48.374 --> 00:16:49.742 line:95%,end
She should be out of work.

00:16:49.808 --> 00:16:52.211 line:95%,end
Girls, three more days.

00:16:52.277 --> 00:16:54.680 line:95%,end
We need to
get this choreography fixed.

00:16:54.747 --> 00:16:55.781 line:95%,end
Got it?

00:16:55.848 --> 00:16:58.117 line:95%,end
Fire And Ice, three more days.

00:16:59.551 --> 00:17:01.420 line:95%,end
Go back to the top, let's do it.

00:17:01.487 --> 00:17:03.288 line:95%,end
There's a story and a theme.

00:17:03.355 --> 00:17:07.593 line:95%,end
The girls are brides,
they hold nosegays,

00:17:07.659 --> 00:17:09.395 line:95%,end
they might even wear garters.

00:17:09.461 --> 00:17:11.930 line:95%,end
One, two, up, up.

00:17:11.997 --> 00:17:15.100 line:95%,end
Down, down, jump over,
don't catch feet.

00:17:15.167 --> 00:17:16.035 line:95%,end
Push.

00:17:16.101 --> 00:17:18.570 line:95%,end
I'm inviting the dads
to come and watch the competition.

00:17:18.637 --> 00:17:21.306 line:95%,end
<i>It's as though</i>
<i>they're giving away their daughters,</i>

00:17:21.373 --> 00:17:22.941 line:95%,end
but instead of giving them
to some guy

00:17:23.008 --> 00:17:25.010 line:95%,end
that's never going to be good enough,

00:17:25.077 --> 00:17:27.246 line:95%,end
he's going to give them
to the world of dance.

00:17:27.312 --> 00:17:29.715 line:95%,end
I want to marry dance, but I don't.
(giggles)

00:17:29.782 --> 00:17:31.550 line:95%,end
<i>If I had to marry someone,</i>

00:17:31.617 --> 00:17:33.719 line:95%,end
I would marry Justin Bieber.

00:17:33.786 --> 00:17:37.623 line:95%,end
ABBY: Girls, remember, your dads
are coming to the competition.

00:17:37.689 --> 00:17:40.192 line:95%,end
They complain
about all the money you spend,

00:17:40.259 --> 00:17:43.629 line:95%,end
all the hours you spend here
at the studio, all the outfits,

00:17:43.695 --> 00:17:45.064 line:95%,end
all the rhinestones.

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:47.566 line:95%,end
Your dad's going to sit-in
that audience and watch you.

00:17:47.633 --> 00:17:50.969 line:95%,end
You want him to say,
oh, my God, look at my kid up there.

00:17:51.036 --> 00:17:52.738 line:95%,end
It's all worth it.

00:17:52.805 --> 00:17:55.574 line:95%,end
It's all worth it
to see her up on that stage.

00:17:55.641 --> 00:17:58.210 line:95%,end
Look what she's accomplished,
look how good she is.

00:17:58.277 --> 00:18:00.345 line:95%,end
I really hope
that Chloe's dad can make it,

00:18:00.412 --> 00:18:02.948 line:95%,end
but I think the bigger question
on everyone's mind is,

00:18:03.015 --> 00:18:05.517 line:95%,end
who is Melissa
going to bring to represent?

00:18:05.584 --> 00:18:09.721 line:95%,end
Is she going to bring
the dad or the sugar daddy?

00:18:09.788 --> 00:18:11.824 line:95%,end
-Their dad's not coming.
-Really?

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:13.058 line:95%,end
He's not going to be here, so.

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:16.528 line:95%,end
-Curt's not coming at all.
-Mm-mm.

00:18:18.163 --> 00:18:19.865 line:95%,end
This is the one time
the dads are asked

00:18:19.932 --> 00:18:22.134 line:95%,end
to come and participate
with their girls,

00:18:22.201 --> 00:18:23.836 line:95%,end
and Melissa
can't put the drama aside.

00:18:23.902 --> 00:18:25.437 line:95%,end
It always has to be about her.

00:18:25.504 --> 00:18:27.039 line:95%,end
Did you not want him to come?

00:18:27.106 --> 00:18:29.208 line:95%,end
No, he's not coming, because he's going
to be at a hockey tournament.

00:18:29.274 --> 00:18:30.242 line:95%,end
Okay.

00:18:30.309 --> 00:18:31.477 line:95%,end
Will Greg come?

00:18:33.078 --> 00:18:34.113 line:95%,end
No way.

00:18:34.179 --> 00:18:36.448 line:95%,end
If Curt can't come,
why wouldn't you just bring Greg?

00:18:36.515 --> 00:18:38.684 line:95%,end
I wouldn't want to hurt feelings.

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:39.852 line:95%,end
You know?

00:18:40.953 --> 00:18:43.922 line:95%,end
But if he couldn't be there,
would his feelings be hurt?

00:18:43.989 --> 00:18:46.625 line:95%,end
If he knew
that Greg did it, yes.

00:18:48.193 --> 00:18:50.496 line:95%,end
I don't know
why you wouldn't bring Greg.

00:18:50.562 --> 00:18:52.664 line:95%,end
They live with Greg, Melissa.

00:18:52.731 --> 00:18:54.766 line:95%,end
I mean, I would love
for him to be there.

00:18:54.833 --> 00:18:57.736 line:95%,end
But absolutely not.

00:18:57.803 --> 00:18:59.204 line:95%,end
I don't know why Melissa
goes crazy

00:18:59.271 --> 00:19:00.906 line:95%,end
every time she hears Curt's name.

00:19:00.973 --> 00:19:04.343 line:95%,end
I mean, he is still Maddie
and Mackenzie's dad.

00:19:04.409 --> 00:19:07.012 line:95%,end
So they still need to have
some kind of relationship

00:19:07.079 --> 00:19:08.280 line:95%,end
just for the girls.

00:19:08.347 --> 00:19:11.917 line:95%,end
I can't wait to see
how our headpieces are all going to look.

00:19:11.984 --> 00:19:15.053 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Oh, I have something
that I'm going to bring to you tomorrow.

00:19:16.255 --> 00:19:18.557 line:95%,end
I think I have a white thing
you might want to use.

00:19:18.624 --> 00:19:19.791 line:95%,end
-I don't know.
-Okay.

00:19:19.858 --> 00:19:21.793 line:95%,end
Oh, it would have been so cool
if I had my gown, you guys.

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:24.763 line:95%,end
We could have cut it up because it has
so many beautiful pieces to it.

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:26.131 line:95%,end
You should have saved it!

00:19:26.198 --> 00:19:28.133 line:95%,end
Your kids
probably would have wanted it.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.536 line:95%,end
Even if they didn't wear it,
they're just for a keepsake.

00:19:30.602 --> 00:19:31.570 line:95%,end
Right.

00:19:31.637 --> 00:19:33.405 line:95%,end
Well, they can help you
pick out a new dress.

00:19:33.472 --> 00:19:36.241 line:95%,end
MELISSA: (snorting laugh)
There won't be any new dresses.


00:19:39.645 --> 00:19:40.812 line:95%,end
-JILL: Hi.
-DANCE MOM: Hi!

00:19:40.879 --> 00:19:42.181 line:95%,end
DANCE MOM: Hey, Jill!

Thank you so much. I'm Jill.

<i>I'm a little nervous walking in here.</i>

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:52.424 line:5%,start
And I meet the moms
and they all welcome me with open arms.

00:19:52.491 --> 00:19:54.026 line:95%,end
They're so nice.

00:19:54.092 --> 00:19:56.195 line:95%,end
They're so polite.

00:19:56.261 --> 00:19:57.396 line:95%,end
-Kendall, have fun.
-Okay.

00:19:57.462 --> 00:19:58.463 line:95%,end
JILL: All right.

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:02.367 line:95%,end
It's just been
a battlefield at that studio.

00:20:02.434 --> 00:20:04.603 line:95%,end
It's a different beast over there.

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:06.171 line:95%,end
-DANCE MOM: Beast?
-Mhm.

00:20:06.238 --> 00:20:08.740 line:95%,end
(laughter)

00:20:08.807 --> 00:20:10.576 line:95%,end
Look at you!

00:20:10.642 --> 00:20:12.044 line:95%,end
DANCE MOM:
Some sparkling apple cider.

JILL: <i>This is so different</i>
<i>from the battlefield</i>

00:20:14.179 --> 00:20:15.948 line:95%,end
<i>the first day I walked into Abby's.</i>

00:20:16.014 --> 00:20:18.417 line:95%,end
-Cheers!
-Cheers to you.

00:20:18.483 --> 00:20:21.253 line:95%,end
JILL: <i>These guys actually</i>
<i>want me to be there.</i>

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:22.554 line:95%,end
And they're really welcoming.

00:20:22.621 --> 00:20:26.525 line:95%,end
This is really nice
to be on the other end of receiving.

00:20:26.592 --> 00:20:27.593 line:95%,end
-Apple toast.
-Apple toast.

00:20:27.659 --> 00:20:28.760 line:95%,end
-Thank you for welcoming me.
-Cheers.

00:20:28.827 --> 00:20:30.095 line:95%,end
-Cheers.
-Cheers, girls.

00:20:30.162 --> 00:20:31.096 line:95%,end
Thank you.

00:20:31.163 --> 00:20:33.699 line:95%,end
CATHY: <i>So why don't we</i>
<i>start in the corner?</i>

00:20:33.765 --> 00:20:36.201 line:5%,start
Let's put your hands
behind your back.

00:20:36.268 --> 00:20:38.403 line:5%,start
And let's just do two walks.

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:40.439 line:95%,end
One, two, three, four, then...

00:20:40.505 --> 00:20:42.007 line:95%,end
JILL: <i>Kendall just wants to dance.</i>

00:20:42.074 --> 00:20:44.676 line:95%,end
She was not doing that enough at Abby's.

00:20:44.743 --> 00:20:47.279 line:95%,end
Pirouette up and over.

00:20:47.346 --> 00:20:48.914 line:95%,end
Pirouette.

00:20:48.981 --> 00:20:50.315 line:95%,end
Now, she's dancing.

00:20:50.382 --> 00:20:51.516 line:95%,end
Your second leg is bent.

00:20:51.583 --> 00:20:52.985 line:95%,end
Can you straighten
it out for me?

00:20:53.051 --> 00:20:54.119 line:95%,end
And straight.

00:20:54.186 --> 00:20:55.320 line:95%,end
Oh, yeah.

00:20:55.387 --> 00:20:59.124 line:95%,end
See how when you give
nice corrections, you get results.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:06.164 line:95%,end
So does Abby and the moms
know you came here?

00:21:06.231 --> 00:21:07.599 line:95%,end
They have no idea.

00:21:07.666 --> 00:21:09.901 line:95%,end
And guess what?
I don't care.

00:21:09.968 --> 00:21:11.737 line:95%,end
I know that when she finds out,

00:21:11.803 --> 00:21:15.007 line:95%,end
she's going to be
probably more angry than hurt.

00:21:15.073 --> 00:21:17.109 line:95%,end
And maybe she'll feel
the anger that I felt

00:21:17.175 --> 00:21:19.044 line:95%,end
when she belittled my child
in front of everybody...

00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:21.446 line:95%,end
-DANCE MOM: Karma.
-...for no reason.

00:21:21.513 --> 00:21:23.949 line:95%,end
CATHY: Do you happen to know
who's at the top of the pyramid?

00:21:24.016 --> 00:21:25.150 line:95%,end
I think it's Nia.

00:21:25.217 --> 00:21:28.253 line:95%,end
Oh, it's Nia that's at--really?

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.188 line:95%,end
Well, if Nia is at the top of the pyramid,

00:21:30.255 --> 00:21:31.556 line:95%,end
you know what that means.

00:21:31.623 --> 00:21:34.226 line:95%,end
She is probably
going to be doing a solo.

00:21:34.293 --> 00:21:37.462 line:95%,end
That means that you and her
are going to be going head-to-head.

00:21:37.529 --> 00:21:38.964 line:95%,end
-Okay.
-Okay?

00:21:39.031 --> 00:21:41.199 line:95%,end
CATHY: <i>Kendall is really</i>
<i>going to kick butt.</i>

00:21:41.266 --> 00:21:44.369 line:95%,end
And Abby,
she's going to miss Kendall

00:21:44.436 --> 00:21:46.171 line:95%,end
<i>being part of her competition team.</i>

00:21:46.238 --> 00:21:50.409 line:95%,end
So are you going to feel badly
if you go head-to-head against Nia?

00:21:50.475 --> 00:21:52.110 line:95%,end
Yeah, I guess.

00:21:52.177 --> 00:21:54.012 line:95%,end
I'm really doing this for Kendall.

00:21:54.079 --> 00:21:57.449 line:95%,end
<i>And if this is the only way I can get Abby</i>
<i>to see what Kendall can do,</i>

00:21:57.516 --> 00:21:59.151 line:95%,end
<i>then this is what it's got to be.</i>

00:22:01.987 --> 00:22:03.455 line:5%,start
ABBY: Nia, this is it.

00:22:03.522 --> 00:22:05.457 line:95%,end
I don't want to see
any mistakes in this number.

00:22:05.524 --> 00:22:06.825 line:95%,end
Go.

00:22:06.892 --> 00:22:08.393 line:95%,end
Chasse.

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:09.628 line:95%,end
Knee, knee.

00:22:09.695 --> 00:22:12.397 line:95%,end
<i>A lot is riding on this solo for Nia.</i>

00:22:12.464 --> 00:22:14.766 line:5%,start
It's an important solo for her

00:22:14.833 --> 00:22:16.468 line:5%,start
and she needs to get her act together.

00:22:16.535 --> 00:22:18.136 line:95%,end
I'm a little confused.

00:22:18.203 --> 00:22:19.604 line:95%,end
Is Melissa engaged?

00:22:19.671 --> 00:22:21.406 line:95%,end
-Well, she has her ring on.
-Exactly.

00:22:21.473 --> 00:22:23.475 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: But today
and yesterday she didn't.

00:22:23.542 --> 00:22:25.344 line:95%,end
I hope that's not a friendship ring.

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:26.712 line:95%,end
-Uh, yeah.
-No.

00:22:26.778 --> 00:22:28.680 line:95%,end
-That's a nice friend.
-Yeah.

00:22:28.747 --> 00:22:30.982 line:95%,end
I want to meet
a friend like that.

00:22:31.049 --> 00:22:32.117 line:95%,end
You have a friend.

00:22:32.184 --> 00:22:34.019 line:95%,end
He needs to buy me
another one of this.

00:22:34.086 --> 00:22:35.520 line:95%,end
(laughter)

00:22:35.587 --> 00:22:37.022 line:95%,end
-Because your other hand's lonely.
-I want to be--

00:22:37.089 --> 00:22:39.725 line:95%,end
I want to have another friend!
(laughs)

00:22:39.791 --> 00:22:42.060 line:95%,end
<i>Melissa has a big rock on her finger,</i>

00:22:42.127 --> 00:22:44.796 line:95%,end
<i>and I don't know why</i>
<i>she's being so secretive about it.</i>

00:22:44.863 --> 00:22:47.099 line:5%,start
It's like, I mean,
every time I ask her about it,

00:22:47.165 --> 00:22:49.301 line:5%,start
she's just like, oh,
it's no big deal.

00:22:50.435 --> 00:22:52.437 line:95%,end
Hand. Hand.

00:22:52.504 --> 00:22:54.506 line:95%,end
Don't go so far.
It's awkward.

00:22:54.573 --> 00:22:57.275 line:95%,end
HOLLY: And then this weekend,
the dads are invited,

00:22:57.342 --> 00:22:59.878 line:95%,end
and she's wearing
another man's engagement ring.

00:22:59.945 --> 00:23:01.913 line:95%,end
Yeah, I wonder if Kurt knows.

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:03.949 line:95%,end
-And I thought maybe that's why...
-If she didn't tell us...

00:23:04.015 --> 00:23:06.885 line:95%,end
-...the ring keeps coming on and off.
-...I can't imagine her telling Kurt.

00:23:06.952 --> 00:23:09.121 line:95%,end
These people are all going to have
to come to terms with things,


00:23:09.187 --> 00:23:10.088 line:95%,end
because there's two
little girls involved.

00:23:10.155 --> 00:23:10.989 line:95%,end
Exactly.

00:23:11.056 --> 00:23:14.092 line:95%,end
And they're going to have a long time
growing up if they don't get along.

00:23:14.159 --> 00:23:16.061 line:95%,end
-I don't know.
-She's so forthcoming.

00:23:16.128 --> 00:23:17.896 line:95%,end
She'll tell you
everything about her body,

00:23:17.963 --> 00:23:22.234 line:95%,end
nooks, crevices, desires,
taboos, all of that.

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:23.602 line:95%,end
KELLY: Fair game.

00:23:23.668 --> 00:23:27.172 line:95%,end
(indistinct) like the time she told me
that she thinks of sex and throbs.

00:23:27.239 --> 00:23:29.241 line:95%,end
KELLY: Ugh, that was bad.

00:23:29.307 --> 00:23:31.076 line:95%,end
That was making me...

00:23:31.143 --> 00:23:34.112 line:95%,end
I mean, I know
that she's cleanly shaved down there,

00:23:34.179 --> 00:23:36.381 line:95%,end
but she won't tell me she's engaged.

00:23:36.448 --> 00:23:38.450 line:95%,end
-Hello!
-That's a little too personal.

00:23:38.517 --> 00:23:40.352 line:95%,end
-I know!
-A little too personal.

00:23:40.419 --> 00:23:42.053 line:95%,end
Kelly, you're crossing the line.

00:23:43.955 --> 00:23:45.590 line:95%,end
(quirky music playing)

00:23:49.394 --> 00:23:51.163 line:5%,start
ABBY: Come on, girls, let's go!

00:23:51.229 --> 00:23:54.533 line:5%,start
KELLY: Ugh!
Girls, be careful. It's slick out here.

00:23:54.599 --> 00:23:56.435 line:95%,end
ABBY:
<i>I love the Fire and Ice competition</i>

00:23:56.501 --> 00:23:58.303 line:95%,end
<i>because it's here in Pittsburgh.</i>

00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:00.539 line:95%,end
<i>So it's always nice</i>
<i>when we get to stay home.</i>

00:24:00.605 --> 00:24:02.574 line:95%,end
<i>I have more time</i>
<i>with Broadway Baby.</i>

00:24:02.641 --> 00:24:06.011 line:95%,end
And they are always thrilled
to see the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:24:06.077 --> 00:24:07.012 line:95%,end
-Hey.
-Hello.

00:24:07.078 --> 00:24:08.280 line:95%,end
(indistinct)

00:24:08.346 --> 00:24:10.916 line:95%,end
I mean, come on,
it's the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:24:12.451 --> 00:24:13.452 line:95%,end
Welcome.

00:24:16.288 --> 00:24:19.090 line:5%,start
(upbeat music playing)

00:24:20.592 --> 00:24:22.761 line:5%,start
KELLY: <i>I'm not excited</i>
<i>about competing in Pittsburgh,</i>

00:24:22.828 --> 00:24:25.797 line:95%,end
because everybody knows Abby,
everybody hates Abby.

00:24:25.864 --> 00:24:29.100 line:95%,end
ABBY: Girls, I need not say

00:24:29.167 --> 00:24:32.037 line:95%,end
how important it is here, yes?

00:24:32.103 --> 00:24:33.705 line:95%,end
We all know what's on the line.

00:24:33.772 --> 00:24:35.207 line:95%,end
It's Fire and Ice.

00:24:35.273 --> 00:24:37.108 line:95%,end
Every one of those people are my friends.

00:24:37.175 --> 00:24:39.110 line:95%,end
I've known them for years.

00:24:39.177 --> 00:24:41.947 line:95%,end
But even though you're friends,
they're still competitive,

00:24:42.013 --> 00:24:43.515 line:95%,end
like your girlfriend at school.

00:24:48.887 --> 00:24:51.556 line:95%,end
CATHY: <i>We've just arrived</i>
<i>at the Fire and Ice competition,</i>

00:24:51.623 --> 00:24:53.458 line:95%,end
and Abby
and all of those moms

00:24:53.525 --> 00:24:55.260 line:95%,end
aren't going to know what hit them

00:24:55.327 --> 00:24:56.995 line:95%,end
<i>when they see my secret little weapon.</i>

00:25:00.131 --> 00:25:02.734 line:95%,end
JILL: I'm a little nervous
walking into this competition

00:25:02.801 --> 00:25:04.102 line:95%,end
with Candy Apples.

00:25:04.169 --> 00:25:06.271 line:95%,end
<i>I'm going to be the one</i>
<i>looking over my shoulder.</i>

00:25:06.338 --> 00:25:09.474 line:95%,end
I'm afraid Christi and Kelly
might come after me with a shotgun.

00:25:09.541 --> 00:25:12.277 line:95%,end
CATHY: You know what,
I want to see with you?

00:25:12.344 --> 00:25:16.114 line:95%,end
I want to take a look
at your solo since it's new.

00:25:16.181 --> 00:25:19.184 line:95%,end
JILL: <i>My goal here</i>
<i>is to have Kendall stand out.</i>

00:25:19.251 --> 00:25:21.219 line:95%,end
Do I think
I'm going to get Abby's attention?

00:25:21.286 --> 00:25:22.220 line:95%,end
Yes.

00:25:22.287 --> 00:25:25.390 line:95%,end
I'm going to do a little more liner
and a little more on her cheeks.

00:25:25.457 --> 00:25:28.226 line:95%,end
Okay. And you know what?
We have do little wings.

00:25:28.293 --> 00:25:29.728 line:95%,end
-Could you please do that?
JILL: Absolutely.

00:25:29.794 --> 00:25:31.196 line:95%,end
CATHY: Do you have
any loose rhinestones?

00:25:31.263 --> 00:25:34.299 line:95%,end
We do little rhinestones on the eye
just to add a little glimmer.

00:25:34.366 --> 00:25:37.402 line:95%,end
JILL: I know I'm going to see Abby
and I just want to say to her,

00:25:37.469 --> 00:25:38.737 line:95%,end
do you see what you made me do.

00:25:40.038 --> 00:25:42.107 line:95%,end
Oh, you don't have
eye shadow on, Jill?

00:25:42.173 --> 00:25:44.342 line:95%,end
-JILL: No.
-Okay, purple. We do purple.

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:46.611 line:95%,end
JILL: Purple shadow?

00:25:46.678 --> 00:25:48.046 line:95%,end
-For real?
-Yeah.

00:25:49.147 --> 00:25:52.884 line:95%,end
JILL: <i>This Candy Apple green room</i>
<i>is a lot different than the one at Abby's.</i>

00:25:52.951 --> 00:25:55.954 line:95%,end
-Close.
-Are you dabbling?

00:25:56.021 --> 00:26:00.292 line:95%,end
Well, I was contemplating purple
with her orange costume,

00:26:00.358 --> 00:26:01.493 line:95%,end
but I trust you.

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:03.395 line:95%,end
-Close.
-Mm.

00:26:03.461 --> 00:26:05.130 line:95%,end
Oh, well.
We'll see what happens.

00:26:05.196 --> 00:26:08.466 line:95%,end
JILL: There's no screaming
or yelling or crying.

00:26:08.533 --> 00:26:10.502 line:95%,end
I don't have to, like,
be looking over my shoulder,

00:26:10.569 --> 00:26:12.771 line:95%,end
<i>feeling the knife</i>
<i>in my back at any second.</i>

00:26:12.837 --> 00:26:15.307 line:95%,end
I can relax
and take care of my child.

00:26:15.373 --> 00:26:17.609 line:95%,end
-Stand up tall.
-Kendall?

00:26:17.676 --> 00:26:18.944 line:95%,end
You walk in there
like you own the place.

00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:22.113 line:95%,end
That's right. And you need to just beam,
because you're so relieved

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:23.782 line:95%,end
and you're so happy right now

00:26:23.848 --> 00:26:26.885 line:95%,end
because you don't have a whole lot
of crappy pressures on you.

00:26:29.154 --> 00:26:30.088 line:95%,end
Let's go.

00:26:32.557 --> 00:26:33.725 line:95%,end
Hi, Kendall.


00:26:36.628 --> 00:26:38.630 line:95%,end
(tense music playing)

00:26:39.998 --> 00:26:41.800 line:95%,end

-Kendall?

You walk in there
like you own the place.

00:26:43.268 --> 00:26:44.536 line:95%,end
-That's right.
-All right, let's go.

00:26:44.603 --> 00:26:46.071 line:95%,end
Nia, I need you. Come on.

00:26:48.773 --> 00:26:50.241 line:95%,end
CATHY: Look,
she doesn't have a kid,

00:26:50.308 --> 00:26:52.677 line:95%,end
but she has a dog in a stroller!

I can not believe
that Kendall is here with Cathy.

00:26:59.584 --> 00:27:01.486 line:95%,end
What is her mother thinking?

CHRISTI: <i>Everybody laughed at me</i>

00:27:06.057 --> 00:27:07.759 line:5%,start
I wanted to look
into Jill's background,

00:27:07.826 --> 00:27:09.494 line:95%,end
<i>but here she is with Cathy.</i>

00:27:09.561 --> 00:27:12.030 line:95%,end
Of all people,
why would you go to Cathy?

00:27:12.097 --> 00:27:14.666 line:95%,end
You're leaving Freddy to go to Jason.

00:27:14.733 --> 00:27:17.135 line:95%,end
Oh, Melissa,
so good to see you.

00:27:17.202 --> 00:27:20.538 line:95%,end
MADDIE: <i>I was so surprised</i>

00:27:20.605 --> 00:27:21.973 line:95%,end
<i>with Candy Apples.</i>

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:25.443 line:5%,start
I mean, I kind of wanted to cry
because it didn't seem right.

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:27.012 line:95%,end
I think she fits better with us.

00:27:27.078 --> 00:27:30.382 line:95%,end
CATHY: All right, well, we have a solo
that we have to go perform.

00:27:30.448 --> 00:27:34.319 line:95%,end
HOLLY: <i>All of a sudden,</i>

00:27:34.386 --> 00:27:36.821 line:5%,start
I felt like I had been punched
in the stomach.

00:27:36.888 --> 00:27:39.124 line:95%,end
-ABBY: Excuse me. Let's go.
-Oh, Kendall, let's go this way.

(upbeat music playing)

00:27:45.363 --> 00:27:46.598 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Anybody else shocked?

00:27:46.665 --> 00:27:48.967 line:95%,end
I can't say I'm really all that shocked
that Jill's with Candy Apples.

00:27:49.034 --> 00:27:50.468 line:95%,end
I mean, it was only a matter of time
before she hop,

00:27:50.535 --> 00:27:51.836 line:95%,end
hop, hop over to somewhere new.

00:27:51.903 --> 00:27:53.638 line:95%,end
I think she's pretty desperate
to go to Candy Apples.

00:27:53.705 --> 00:27:54.906 line:95%,end
Well, that's what I'm thinking.

00:27:54.973 --> 00:27:56.574 line:95%,end
I wouldn't think
that that's where she would go.

00:27:56.641 --> 00:27:59.344 line:95%,end
I would think she would move further,
like towards New York.

00:27:59.411 --> 00:28:01.746 line:95%,end
I'm feeling pretty betrayed
to see someone who I thought

00:28:01.813 --> 00:28:05.684 line:95%,end
was on my team walk through
the door on the competition team.

00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:06.785 line:95%,end
You know what's going
to be the problem?

00:28:06.851 --> 00:28:08.153 line:95%,end
Guess who's she's
going to be up against?

00:28:08.219 --> 00:28:10.422 line:95%,end
-I know.
-(indistinct) Nia.

00:28:10.488 --> 00:28:11.756 line:95%,end
I bet she's going to do a solo.

00:28:11.823 --> 00:28:14.626 line:95%,end
<i>I feel like Jill</i>
<i>has become the ultimate traitor</i>

00:28:14.693 --> 00:28:17.262 line:95%,end
to put her daughter up
to dance against a teammate.

00:28:17.328 --> 00:28:19.064 line:95%,end
She was a teammate of ours.

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:20.498 line:95%,end
Who does that?

00:28:20.565 --> 00:28:21.933 line:95%,end
Well, I hope Nia has a great time...

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.501 line:95%,end
-She will.
-KELLY: Me too.

00:28:23.568 --> 00:28:24.636 line:95%,end
...on stage.
That's the most important thing.

00:28:24.703 --> 00:28:26.371 line:95%,end
-That's all that matters.
-HOLLY: That's all that matters.

00:28:26.438 --> 00:28:28.406 line:95%,end
At this point, that's all we have
to keep telling our kids.

00:28:28.473 --> 00:28:32.043 line:95%,end
It's all about having fun (indistinct)
like kill everybody!

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:33.411 line:95%,end
But I don't know how much fun it is

00:28:33.478 --> 00:28:35.280 line:95%,end
to compete against someone
who's your former teammate.

00:28:35.346 --> 00:28:36.581 line:95%,end
-Yeah.
-That's hard.

00:28:36.648 --> 00:28:38.316 line:95%,end
Oh, yeah. Wonder if any of the dads
have gotten here?

00:28:38.383 --> 00:28:40.585 line:95%,end
-Maybe Greg will surprise you.
-Maybe.

00:28:40.652 --> 00:28:42.654 line:95%,end
It can happen.

00:28:42.721 --> 00:28:44.422 line:95%,end
I think this meeting is adjourned.

00:28:44.489 --> 00:28:45.724 line:95%,end
-Okay.
-Yeah.

00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:48.626 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:28:52.697 --> 00:28:55.867 line:95%,end
So I just wanted to tell you
that I was really reluctant

00:28:55.934 --> 00:28:57.769 line:95%,end
-when you called.
-I know.

00:28:57.836 --> 00:29:02.373 line:95%,end
Because I don't like
to engage in Abby's sloppy seconds.

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:04.476 line:95%,end
I hope you're feeling welcome.

00:29:04.542 --> 00:29:05.443 line:95%,end
-I am.
-Good.

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:07.078 line:95%,end
Everybody's been really nice.
Thank you.

Hi, Kendall.

00:29:10.849 --> 00:29:13.418 line:95%,end
You're dancing with Candy Apples?

00:29:13.485 --> 00:29:14.486 line:95%,end
Yeah.

00:29:14.552 --> 00:29:17.355 line:5%,start
I was really excited
to perform my solo

00:29:17.422 --> 00:29:19.991 line:5%,start
because I just wanted to see Abby's face.

00:29:20.058 --> 00:29:21.459 line:95%,end
You have a solo too?

00:29:21.526 --> 00:29:22.527 line:95%,end
Yes.

00:29:22.594 --> 00:29:24.929 line:95%,end
I like your crown.

00:29:24.996 --> 00:29:26.631 line:95%,end
I'm supposed to be a princess.

00:29:26.698 --> 00:29:27.599 line:95%,end
Well, good luck.

00:29:27.665 --> 00:29:29.167 line:95%,end
You too.

00:29:29.234 --> 00:29:32.570 line:5%,start
I'm a little nervous
to have a solo against Kendall.

00:29:32.637 --> 00:29:36.407 line:95%,end
But I'm going to try
very, very hard to make it my best.

00:30:46.878 --> 00:30:49.647 line:95%,end

right on the money.

straightening her legs,
stretching her feet.

Abby just couldn't see
her potential, her talent.

Cathy didn't have
to put Kendall up against Nia.

Cathy knows
that Nia deserves a chance to shine.

00:31:54.012 --> 00:31:57.181 line:95%,end

shady thing to do.

<i>And the routine</i>

You're making me sad.

00:34:35.773 --> 00:34:37.008 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Okay,
let's not talk to her, please.

00:34:37.075 --> 00:34:39.277 line:95%,end
Please, I don't want--
we're ready to go on stage.

00:34:39.343 --> 00:34:40.278 line:95%,end
Just leave her alone.

00:34:40.344 --> 00:34:41.479 line:95%,end
It doesn't matter about the dance.
It matters about me.

00:34:41.546 --> 00:34:43.281 line:95%,end
I do. It does matter about you.

00:34:43.347 --> 00:34:44.348 line:95%,end
I'm emotional.

00:34:44.415 --> 00:34:45.783 line:95%,end
Emotional. You're so cute.

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:46.784 line:95%,end
Stop it, Mom.

00:34:46.851 --> 00:34:47.919 line:95%,end
You're so cute, honey. Hey.

00:34:47.985 --> 00:34:49.687 line:95%,end
-Stop.
-Don't cry.

00:34:49.754 --> 00:34:51.155 line:95%,end
ABBY: All right, it's time.

00:34:51.222 --> 00:34:52.790 line:95%,end
Don't forget your dads are out there.

00:34:55.126 --> 00:34:56.160 line:95%,end
-Love you.
-Love you too.

00:34:56.227 --> 00:34:57.128 line:95%,end
Good luck.

<i>âªBut really,</i>

00:35:27.558 --> 00:35:30.294 line:95%,end

00:35:32.763 --> 00:35:35.433 line:95%,end
<i>âªI won't make a fussâª</i>

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:38.469 line:95%,end
<i>âªJust as long as it's usâª</i>

00:35:38.536 --> 00:35:40.104 line:95%,end
<i>âªI don't care what they sayâª</i>

00:35:40.171 --> 00:35:42.707 line:95%,end
<i>âªThey can say what they wantâª</i>

00:35:42.773 --> 00:35:43.908 line:95%,end
MACKENZIE:
<i>I wish my dad was here,</i>

00:35:43.975 --> 00:35:45.943 line:95%,end
because he could watch me dance.

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:50.181 line:95%,end
SINGER:
<i>âªBecause I'm head over heelsâª</i>

00:35:53.351 --> 00:35:56.053 line:95%,end
<i>âªOh, baby I love youâª</i>

00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:56.988 line:95%,end
<i>âªI love youâª</i>

00:35:57.054 --> 00:35:57.922 line:95%,end
<i>âªI love youâª</i>

00:35:57.989 --> 00:36:02.527 line:95%,end

(cheering)

00:36:04.529 --> 00:36:07.365 line:95%,end
MACKENZIE: Always a bridesmaid.
Never a bride.

(upbeat music playing)

00:36:11.836 --> 00:36:15.273 line:95%,end
PA: From Candy Apples Dance Center,
please welcome number 287,

00:36:15.339 --> 00:36:16.407 line:95%,end
This is "A Funeral."

00:36:16.474 --> 00:36:17.475 line:95%,end
(applause)

00:36:17.542 --> 00:36:20.545 line:5%,start
(dramatic music playing)

00:36:39.197 --> 00:36:40.932 line:5%,start
KELLY: I think that Cathy actually

00:36:40.998 --> 00:36:43.134 line:5%,start
may have some good dancers
at her studio.

00:36:43.201 --> 00:36:46.237 line:95%,end
<i>The problem is that they're just old.</i>

00:36:46.304 --> 00:36:49.240 line:95%,end
Cathy needs to put Vivi
and her two little friends

00:36:49.307 --> 00:36:50.908 line:95%,end
in there to bring the age down.

00:37:02.186 --> 00:37:05.189 line:95%,end
(applause)

00:37:07.024 --> 00:37:09.327 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>Cathy doesn't know</i>
<i>how to choreograph.</i>

00:37:09.393 --> 00:37:11.996 line:95%,end
<i>And who runs into a funeral</i>
<i>and does an arabesque?</i>

00:37:12.063 --> 00:37:13.397 line:5%,start
Vivi-Anne.

00:37:13.464 --> 00:37:16.000 line:5%,start
(upbeat music playing)


00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:21.138 line:95%,end
PA: In our Junior Small Groups,

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:26.010 line:95%,end
we have a first place overall award.

00:37:26.077 --> 00:37:27.778 line:95%,end
And that is going to...

00:37:30.081 --> 00:37:34.485 line:95%,end
number 288, "Head Over Heels!"

00:37:34.552 --> 00:37:37.521 line:5%,start
(cheering)

00:37:39.757 --> 00:37:42.727 line:95%,end
ABBY: The girls actually got a platinum
in their performance

00:37:42.793 --> 00:37:46.631 line:95%,end
and they won the overall high score
for the junior groups.

00:37:48.532 --> 00:37:52.036 line:95%,end
PA: For your first place overall
Junior Soloist,

00:37:53.704 --> 00:37:56.674 line:95%,end
number 21, "I Think I Like You."

00:37:56.741 --> 00:37:58.743 line:95%,end
(cheering)

00:38:00.278 --> 00:38:02.079 line:5%,start
HOLLY: <i>My child was set up.</i>

00:38:02.146 --> 00:38:05.850 line:5%,start
It was like I have been blindsided.

00:38:05.916 --> 00:38:10.888 line:95%,end
And I'm not sure what game
is being played between Jill,

00:38:10.955 --> 00:38:14.659 line:95%,end
<i>Candy Apples, Cathy,</i>
<i>and Abby for that matter,</i>

00:38:14.725 --> 00:38:17.795 line:95%,end
but my daughter's not a pawn
in this whole game.

00:38:17.862 --> 00:38:20.598 line:95%,end
This is real for her,
and I feel like she was a pawn

00:38:20.665 --> 00:38:22.900 line:95%,end
in their bigger game
that they were playing

00:38:22.967 --> 00:38:24.201 line:95%,end
at my daughter's expense.

00:38:24.268 --> 00:38:26.537 line:95%,end
Where's Nia?

00:38:26.604 --> 00:38:28.339 line:95%,end
Nia, what's up?

00:38:29.407 --> 00:38:31.108 line:95%,end
Nia, what's wrong?

00:38:31.175 --> 00:38:34.145 line:5%,start
NIA: I did really want to win
because my dad was there,

00:38:34.211 --> 00:38:36.080 line:5%,start
but it will come again.

00:38:36.147 --> 00:38:39.383 line:95%,end
You could not have been
more beautiful out there.

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:41.319 line:95%,end
You should be proud of yourself.

00:38:41.385 --> 00:38:42.887 line:95%,end
You did the number.

00:38:42.953 --> 00:38:44.555 line:95%,end
You finished it.

00:38:44.622 --> 00:38:46.524 line:95%,end
Hold your chin up high.

00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:49.160 line:95%,end
You have nothing
to be embarrassed about.

00:38:49.226 --> 00:38:50.895 line:95%,end
-Not at all, sweetie.
-Not at all.

00:38:50.961 --> 00:38:52.697 line:95%,end
People who don't cry crying.

00:38:52.763 --> 00:38:54.432 line:95%,end
ABBY: Why are we crying and pouting?

00:38:54.498 --> 00:38:57.635 line:95%,end
And I see one kid in tears,
one kid pouting,

00:38:57.702 --> 00:38:59.270 line:95%,end
and one kid sitting on their dad's lap.

00:38:59.337 --> 00:39:01.672 line:95%,end
Don't carry it
into the dressing room.

00:39:01.739 --> 00:39:04.008 line:95%,end
You go home.
You cry into your pillow.

00:39:04.075 --> 00:39:05.376 line:95%,end
You figure out what you did wrong

00:39:05.443 --> 00:39:07.211 line:95%,end
and you don't make
the same mistakes again.

00:39:07.278 --> 00:39:12.750 line:95%,end
CATHY: Jill, we would like to present you
with a Candy Apples Dance Mom jacket.

00:39:12.817 --> 00:39:17.555 line:95%,end
So this is for you,
and we want you to have this.

00:39:17.621 --> 00:39:21.759 line:5%,start
JILL: I feel great
that there's no such thing as probation

00:39:21.826 --> 00:39:23.361 line:95%,end
at Candy Apples.

00:39:23.427 --> 00:39:25.329 line:95%,end
<i>I don't have that</i>
<i>hanging over my head.</i>

00:39:25.396 --> 00:39:27.198 line:95%,end
<i>And you know what?</i>
<i>Kendall feels great too</i>

00:39:27.264 --> 00:39:29.934 line:95%,end
<i>because she can go out</i>
<i>and dance and do her thing</i>

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.802 line:95%,end
and not be afraid to do great.

00:39:31.869 --> 00:39:34.438 line:95%,end
-Wait. Are you leaving?
-I need a break.

00:39:34.505 --> 00:39:37.074 line:95%,end
For what just happened out there,
you know it was wrong.

00:39:37.141 --> 00:39:39.276 line:95%,end
She did a beautiful job.

00:39:39.343 --> 00:39:41.545 line:95%,end
And a child who has been off,

00:39:41.612 --> 00:39:44.348 line:95%,end
this kid has been working her tail off...

00:39:44.415 --> 00:39:45.850 line:95%,end
-Yeah.
-HOLLY: ...late at night.

00:39:45.916 --> 00:39:48.586 line:95%,end
-ABBY: (indistinct)
-I think it's not a reflection of her job.

00:39:48.652 --> 00:39:50.788 line:95%,end
-Outstanding.
-ABBY: Right.

00:39:50.855 --> 00:39:53.557 line:95%,end
I just do not like
the way that played itself out.

00:39:53.624 --> 00:39:54.592 line:95%,end
ABBY: Mhm.

00:39:54.658 --> 00:39:57.361 line:95%,end
It's tough enough
having to deal with Abby,

00:39:57.428 --> 00:39:59.930 line:95%,end
but I've learned
over the years how to handle her.

00:39:59.997 --> 00:40:01.832 line:95%,end
But when it comes
to my daughter's happiness,

00:40:01.899 --> 00:40:05.836 line:95%,end
I don't want have to go up
against Jill and Cathy too.

00:40:05.903 --> 00:40:07.605 line:95%,end
-KELLY: Oh, God, here they come.
-CHRISTI: Here they come.

00:40:07.671 --> 00:40:09.740 line:95%,end
Come on, Cathy.
You have parting words?

00:40:09.807 --> 00:40:12.777 line:95%,end
We may be number two
and we may be trying harder,

00:40:12.843 --> 00:40:16.280 line:95%,end
but, Abby, there will come
a day when we beat you.

00:40:16.347 --> 00:40:19.049 line:95%,end
Because you have six kids
that you have to worry about.

00:40:19.116 --> 00:40:20.384 line:95%,end
I have 306.

00:40:20.451 --> 00:40:22.319 line:95%,end
ABBY: Cathy,
how do you still have that membership

00:40:22.386 --> 00:40:24.155 line:95%,end
when you solicit students?

00:40:24.221 --> 00:40:26.490 line:95%,end
Um, I'm not soliciting anybody, Abby!

00:40:26.557 --> 00:40:28.692 line:95%,end
She came to me
at her own free will.

00:40:28.759 --> 00:40:31.228 line:95%,end
She called me up
and said that you were a witch!

00:40:31.295 --> 00:40:34.865 line:5%,start
ABBY: Cathy makes my blood boil.

00:40:34.932 --> 00:40:37.168 line:5%,start
You went as Candy Apples
Dance Center today,

00:40:37.234 --> 00:40:39.403 line:5%,start
so that was a win
for Candy Apples.

00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:41.071 line:5%,start
With our number!

00:40:41.138 --> 00:40:42.673 line:5%,start
The dance world doesn't have rules,

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:45.342 line:5%,start
so Cathy can poach
any student that she wants.

00:40:45.409 --> 00:40:49.413 line:5%,start
But Jill made a big, big mistake.

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:50.781 line:5%,start
-Big.
-CATHY: Yes, I tweaked it!

00:40:50.848 --> 00:40:52.383 line:5%,start
I think there's a lot of studios in Ohio

00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:54.218 line:5%,start
that got in big trouble
for stealing choreography.

00:40:54.285 --> 00:40:56.720 line:5%,start
Oh, believe me, Abby,
I wouldn't want to steal

00:40:56.787 --> 00:40:59.423 line:5%,start
your choreography, really.

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:00.891 line:5%,start
Let's go, guys.
