ABBY: <i>Previously on </i>Dance Moms...

00:00:02.602 --> 00:00:04.537 line:5%,start
These mothers are calling
my daughter a cheater.

00:00:06.406 --> 00:00:07.741 line:5%,start
<i>Did you cheat for my daughter?</i>

00:00:07.807 --> 00:00:09.642 line:5%,start
ABBY: Absolutely not.

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:11.711 line:5%,start
Paige, put the pink on.

00:00:12.212 --> 00:00:13.680 line:5%,start
Oh, the pink is too big.

00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:15.248 line:5%,start
Paige, she doesn't matter.

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:17.684 line:5%,start
God forbid you would see Paige
stand down just a little bit.

00:00:17.751 --> 00:00:18.852 line:5%,start
ABBY: If I was competing,

00:00:18.918 --> 00:00:20.820 line:5%,start
<i>I'd have a headset on and I'd be</i>
<i>doing that dance in my head.</i>

00:00:20.887 --> 00:00:22.555 line:5%,start
ANNOUNCER: <i>Mackenzie, "Daisy Chains."</i>

00:00:22.622 --> 00:00:23.556 line:5%,start
(cheering)

00:00:23.623 --> 00:00:24.457 line:5%,start
ABBY: <i>Second is not good enough.</i>

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:25.492 line:5%,start
Do you understand that?

00:00:25.558 --> 00:00:27.227 line:5%,start
Save yourself the aggravation.

00:00:27.293 --> 00:00:28.595 line:5%,start
Save me the time.

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:29.529 line:5%,start
Get it?

00:00:30.663 --> 00:00:32.365 line:5%,start
<i>Coming up on </i>Dance Moms...

00:00:32.432 --> 00:00:34.901 line:5%,start
This weekend is my first dance.

00:00:34.968 --> 00:00:36.369 line:5%,start
ABBY: <i>Everyone's replaceable.</i>

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:37.837 line:5%,start
DANCE MOM: Oh, here comes Peyton again.

00:00:37.904 --> 00:00:39.606 line:5%,start
I don't care if you don't like.

00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:40.607 line:5%,start
I don't like you, either.

00:00:40.673 --> 00:00:42.709 line:5%,start
ABBY: I'm trying to do something
that I've never done before,

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:46.179 line:5%,start
two titles in two hours,
and it's our secret.

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:47.814 line:5%,start
I don't know why they're all so confused.

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:50.116 line:5%,start
It's the biggest competition
in the United States.

00:00:50.183 --> 00:00:51.951 line:5%,start
<i>Mackenzie is a beat behind.</i>

00:00:52.018 --> 00:00:53.486 line:5%,start
<i>I don't know what</i>
<i>I'm going to do with her.</i>

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:57.157 line:5%,start
Our dance teacher sets
these kids up to fail.

00:00:57.223 --> 00:00:58.691 line:5%,start
I'm ready to go. I'm done. I'm done.

00:00:58.758 --> 00:01:00.794 line:5%,start
Don't let the door hit you on the way out.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.096 line:95%,end
(theme music playing)

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:04.798 line:95%,end
SINGER: <i>âª Get up âª</i>

00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:06.766 line:95%,end
<i>âª Get on the floor âª</i>

00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:12.038 line:95%,end
<i>âª My world is with my girls</i>

00:01:12.972 --> 00:01:15.442 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:18.578 line:5%,start
ABBY: <i>Girls, let's go.</i>
<i>Come on. Come on. Come on.</i>

00:01:18.645 --> 00:01:19.479 line:5%,start
<i>Hustle up.</i>

00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:21.714 line:95%,end
You should all run in here,
wanting to be first.

00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:28.521 line:95%,end
All right, so Energy Dance
in Waterford, Michigan.

00:01:29.522 --> 00:01:31.124 line:95%,end
Again, you were second.

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:33.226 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:01:35.995 --> 00:01:38.298 line:95%,end
Any other teacher
would probably think, overall,

00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:40.066 line:95%,end
high score, second place was wonderful.

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:41.768 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>I think it was a gift from God</i>

00:01:41.835 --> 00:01:43.603 line:5%,start
getting second place with that number.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.839 line:95%,end
And now the pyramid.

00:01:47.207 --> 00:01:48.475 line:95%,end
On the bottom,

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:53.513 line:5%,start
Paige and Brooke.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.685 line:95%,end
Once again, you're still on probation.

00:01:59.752 --> 00:02:01.888 line:95%,end
I'm just saying they need
to give my kids more time.

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:02.956 line:95%,end
Oh, I agree.

00:02:03.022 --> 00:02:05.091 line:95%,end
<i>I am not letting my daughter</i>
<i>go on that stage.</i>

00:02:05.158 --> 00:02:06.793 line:95%,end
<i>I'm pulling their solos.</i>

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.163 line:95%,end
ABBY: You never came to me
and said, hey, can I enter my solo?

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:12.999 line:5%,start
I thought they would come to me
and say, please, let us do our solos.

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:14.434 line:5%,start
Could you ask the lady
if you can write them in?

00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:16.236 line:95%,end
<i>Nope, never happened.</i>

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:18.705 line:95%,end
<i>They don't want to do the work to win,</i>

00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:20.540 line:95%,end
but they don't want to lose, either.

00:02:20.607 --> 00:02:22.475 line:95%,end
So what do they do? They bail.

00:02:22.542 --> 00:02:25.912 line:95%,end
Brooke, you should want to do that
acrobatic routine. It was beautiful.

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:28.081 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>I have learned that if you</i>
<i>ask Abby for something,</i>

00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:29.382 line:95%,end
<i>she does the total opposite.</i>

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:32.385 line:95%,end
So why would my kids go up to her
and ask her for a solo?

00:02:32.452 --> 00:02:35.555 line:95%,end
Next, Nia.

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.458 line:95%,end
Nia, you did a great job on your solo.

00:02:38.525 --> 00:02:39.792 line:95%,end
You made the top 10.

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:41.394 line:95%,end
But pay attention to the technique.

00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:42.662 line:95%,end
Apply your corrections.

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:44.397 line:95%,end
You don't always do that.

00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:46.399 line:95%,end
Next, we have

00:02:47.467 --> 00:02:48.401 line:95%,end
Chloe.

00:02:48.468 --> 00:02:50.370 line:95%,end
Chloe, great job in the duet.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.308 line:95%,end
Came out. Your back leg
was up on the arabesque.

00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:56.876 line:95%,end
You fixed your problems.

00:02:56.943 --> 00:02:58.411 line:95%,end
You had a good weekend.

00:02:58.478 --> 00:03:01.548 line:95%,end
Next on the pyramid, Maddie.

00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:04.217 line:95%,end
Maddie, you had an outstanding solo.

00:03:04.617 --> 00:03:06.352 line:95%,end
You did a beautiful job on the duet.

00:03:07.387 --> 00:03:10.557 line:95%,end
On top of the pyramid
this week is Mackenzie.

00:03:10.623 --> 00:03:12.892 line:95%,end
She won the overall high score

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.362 line:95%,end
and was crowned Petite Miss Energy Dance.

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:17.764 line:95%,end
ANNOUNCER: <i>Mackenzie, "Daisy Chains."</i>

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.232 line:95%,end
(cheering)

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:20.800 line:95%,end
MACKENZIE: <i>I'm at the top of the pyramid.</i>

00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:22.835 line:5%,start
I love being at the top of the pyramid.

00:03:22.902 --> 00:03:24.671 line:95%,end
Let's give her a round of applause.

00:03:24.737 --> 00:03:25.738 line:95%,end
(applause)

00:03:25.805 --> 00:03:28.408 line:95%,end
MELISSA: <i>Mackenzie typically</i>
<i>is not on the top of the pyramid.</i>

00:03:28.474 --> 00:03:31.311 line:5%,start
She's usually down in the bottom row.

00:03:31.811 --> 00:03:35.415 line:95%,end
So I'm really excited she has
the opportunity this week.

00:03:35.481 --> 00:03:38.685 line:95%,end
ABBY: This week we will be
attending Star Power

00:03:38.751 --> 00:03:40.820 line:95%,end
in Woodbridge, Virginia.

00:03:41.654 --> 00:03:45.692 line:95%,end
This is the largest dance competition

00:03:45.758 --> 00:03:47.327 line:95%,end
in the United States.

00:03:48.828 --> 00:03:50.964 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>It's the 25th</i>
<i>anniversary of Star Power</i>

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.399 line:5%,start
and this is their biggest
competition in the country,

00:03:53.466 --> 00:03:56.903 line:95%,end
<i>and so it has the most acts</i>
<i>and the most pressure.</i>


00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.738 line:95%,end
I'm excited about the group dance.

00:03:58.805 --> 00:04:00.273 line:95%,end
I've been preparing it for weeks.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.910 line:95%,end
Mackenzie, you proved
that you're not a little baby anymore.

00:04:03.977 --> 00:04:07.146 line:95%,end
You must be advanced enough
to be in the group dance.

00:04:07.213 --> 00:04:09.015 line:95%,end
I'm not watering down
the choreography.

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:11.551 line:95%,end
You'll be expected to do
what everyone else does.

00:04:11.618 --> 00:04:16.923 line:95%,end
Maddie, you will be doing a routine
called "Looking for a Place like Home."

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:20.193 line:95%,end
It's a little spin
on there's no place like home,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.828 line:95%,end
a modern day version.

00:04:21.894 --> 00:04:23.496 line:95%,end
We're going to wear
powder blue and white.

00:04:23.563 --> 00:04:26.933 line:95%,end
We're going to click our heels,
pay a little homage to Dorothy.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.602 line:95%,end
However, it's modern. It's now.

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.672 line:95%,end
Chloe, you will also be doing a solo.

00:04:33.973 --> 00:04:37.543 line:95%,end
Your solo is entitled
"What Goes Around, Comes Around."

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.679 line:95%,end
If Abby truly believes that,
she better look out,

00:04:39.746 --> 00:04:41.981 line:95%,end
because fate's going to run her over
with a Mack truck.

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:44.217 line:95%,end
Yes, Brooke?

00:04:45.351 --> 00:04:49.422 line:95%,end
This weekend
is my first formal school dance

00:04:49.489 --> 00:04:53.226 line:95%,end
and I was wondering
if I would be able to go to it.

00:04:56.062 --> 00:04:57.664 line:95%,end
ABBY: I think if I was in your position,

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.565 line:95%,end
I would probably make
a different decision.

00:04:59.632 --> 00:05:02.235 line:95%,end
However, if you have decided
that this is something

00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:05.505 line:95%,end
you want to do,
far be it for me to keep you from it.

00:05:05.571 --> 00:05:09.242 line:95%,end
If I demanded that Brooke go
to the competition this week,

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:12.278 line:95%,end
I would have had brooding Brooke
on my hands,

00:05:12.345 --> 00:05:16.249 line:95%,end
a miserable, rotten,
disrespectful teenager.

00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:17.950 line:95%,end
You will not be
in the group number this week.

00:05:18.017 --> 00:05:20.453 line:95%,end
You will not be joining us on the trip.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.689 line:95%,end
-Thank you.
-Everyone's replaceable.

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.092 line:95%,end
Moms, you are dismissed.
Thank you very much.

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:28.161 line:95%,end
Girls, spread apart.
We're going to warm up.

00:05:28.227 --> 00:05:29.162 line:95%,end
See ya.

00:05:32.565 --> 00:05:33.666 line:95%,end
Let me see what this looks like.

00:05:34.734 --> 00:05:37.270 line:5%,start
Step out on your right
and switch hands.

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:38.338 line:5%,start
Lunge.

00:05:38.404 --> 00:05:41.341 line:5%,start
<i>The group number four this week</i>
<i>is called "The Huntress."</i>

00:05:41.407 --> 00:05:45.244 line:95%,end
<i>It's an inspiration from that movie</i>
"The Hunger Games,"

00:05:45.311 --> 00:05:51.017 line:95%,end
and it's about children
telling each other to survive.

00:05:51.084 --> 00:05:53.753 line:95%,end
You know,
it's survival of the fittest.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.323 line:95%,end
Girls, obviously,
I'm going to replace Brooke.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.791 line:95%,end
I don't need Brooke there.

00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:01.894 line:95%,end
<i>She's a great little acrobat,</i>
<i>but as far as a group goes,</i>

00:06:01.961 --> 00:06:05.098 line:95%,end
I need a leader,
so I get to bring in a new dancer.

00:06:05.164 --> 00:06:06.199 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Why do we need
to replace Brooke?

00:06:06.265 --> 00:06:08.634 line:95%,end
Because there's five people
in the dance already

00:06:08.701 --> 00:06:11.070 line:95%,end
and you only need four
to be a small group.

00:06:11.137 --> 00:06:13.706 line:95%,end
ABBY: Maddie,
I want you to go to Peyton.

00:06:13.773 --> 00:06:15.341 line:95%,end
Do not make a big deal out of it.

00:06:15.408 --> 00:06:17.777 line:95%,end
Just go and top her
on the shoulder and say, come with me.

00:06:17.844 --> 00:06:19.312 line:95%,end
Okay.

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:21.247 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I don't understand
why we need another person.

00:06:21.314 --> 00:06:22.348 line:95%,end
We don't.

00:06:22.415 --> 00:06:24.283 line:95%,end
KELLY: Abby just wants
to make this statement,

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:25.752 line:95%,end
that everybody is replaceable.

00:06:27.553 --> 00:06:29.389 line:95%,end
Oh, here comes Peyton again.

00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.060 line:95%,end
ABBY:
Brooke is going away this weekend,

00:06:34.127 --> 00:06:35.328 line:95%,end
so I'm looking to replace her.

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:39.031 line:95%,end
I can't imagine that she would go back
and invite her again

00:06:39.098 --> 00:06:41.367 line:95%,end
to the group
when it didn't work the first time.

00:06:41.434 --> 00:06:43.870 line:95%,end
ABBY: Peyton, we all know
everyone is replaceable.

00:06:43.936 --> 00:06:47.540 line:95%,end
You were not the right replacement
for this group.

00:06:47.607 --> 00:06:48.741 line:95%,end
You cannot be upset.

00:06:48.808 --> 00:06:51.177 line:95%,end
She's too old.
Because when you put older people in,

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:52.278 line:95%,end
it drives up the age group.

00:06:52.345 --> 00:06:53.846 line:95%,end
We do fine where we are.

00:06:54.881 --> 00:06:56.449 line:95%,end
KELLY: I think all the moms
were concerned

00:06:56.516 --> 00:06:58.017 line:95%,end
about Peyton being in the group.

00:06:58.084 --> 00:07:00.019 line:95%,end
<i>There has been rumors</i>
<i>going around the studio</i>

00:07:06.893 --> 00:07:07.794 line:95%,end
Yup.

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.630 line:95%,end
She just went up to her
and pushed her on both shoulders

00:07:10.696 --> 00:07:11.697 line:95%,end
and knocked her down.

00:07:13.332 --> 00:07:15.501 line:95%,end

what they say,

00:07:15.568 --> 00:07:17.370 line:95%,end
-apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
-Yeah.

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:19.639 line:95%,end
Just think, we have to put up
with Leslie all weekend.

Wha.

00:07:20.873 --> 00:07:23.009 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: First day of rehearsal,
we're sitting upstairs watching,

00:07:23.075 --> 00:07:25.411 line:95%,end
and I'm thinking,
there's no Leslie today.

00:07:25.478 --> 00:07:29.115 line:95%,end
And this is just the calm

You all will be dinner.

Peyton, cast as the huntress,

00:07:38.858 --> 00:07:42.795 line:95%,end
will now hunt the other dancers,
if you will.

You have your bow

00:07:45.064 --> 00:07:46.732 line:95%,end
And get me in a deeply pli.

00:07:46.799 --> 00:07:47.733 line:95%,end
There you go.

-And she's the star.
-...and she's the star of the dance.

It's not
that she's the star of the dance

00:07:58.744 --> 00:08:00.012 line:95%,end
because she's the best one in the group,

00:08:00.079 --> 00:08:02.381 line:95%,end
she's the star of the dance
because she doesn't fit in.

00:08:02.448 --> 00:08:05.952 line:95%,end
Five, six, seven, and slow and hold.

00:08:06.018 --> 00:08:07.720 line:95%,end
Slow and hold.

-Hello.

We are looking for a dress
for her eighth grade farewell.

I want Brooke to go
to her eighth grade farewell dance

00:08:39.785 --> 00:08:42.822 line:95%,end

00:08:42.889 --> 00:08:44.090 line:95%,end
Mm-mm.

00:08:44.156 --> 00:08:45.625 line:95%,end
No?

00:08:45.691 --> 00:08:47.293 line:95%,end
-God.
-Mm-mm.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.495 line:95%,end
Oh, Brooke, you're so picky.

00:08:49.562 --> 00:08:51.764 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Kelly's asked me to go
dress shopping with her and Brooke.

00:08:51.831 --> 00:08:53.566 line:95%,end
You want to try this one?

00:08:53.633 --> 00:08:55.234 line:95%,end
Whoo.

00:08:55.301 --> 00:08:57.870 line:95%,end
I like it when we get to do
fun things with our girls,

00:08:57.937 --> 00:09:00.072 line:95%,end
and it's not very often
that that happens.

00:09:00.139 --> 00:09:02.708 line:95%,end
-All right, Brooke, fashion show. Go.
-All right, go ahead.

00:09:04.677 --> 00:09:06.178 line:95%,end
-It's too big for me.
-CHRISTI: Ooh.

00:09:06.245 --> 00:09:09.315 line:95%,end
Oh, well, it's pretty
but it may be a little big.

00:09:09.382 --> 00:09:11.083 line:95%,end
I think the color's beautiful
with your dark hair.

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:12.151 line:95%,end
It's not my favorite.

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:14.020 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Oh, I love that dress.

00:09:14.086 --> 00:09:16.155 line:95%,end
Look how beautiful.

00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:18.057 line:95%,end
The dress is gorgeous.

00:09:18.124 --> 00:09:19.125 line:95%,end
That's pretty.

00:09:21.861 --> 00:09:23.129 line:95%,end
It looks like a costume.

00:09:26.098 --> 00:09:27.133 line:95%,end
KELLY: You like that one?

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.502 line:95%,end
I like this one.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:31.938 line:95%,end
Is she crying?

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:35.875 line:95%,end
It's going to be hard.

00:09:37.376 --> 00:09:38.811 line:95%,end
I don't want her to go without me.

00:09:39.979 --> 00:09:41.781 line:95%,end
<i>This is her first big event</i>

00:09:41.847 --> 00:09:45.284 line:95%,end
and I'm going to miss it
because of a dance competition.

00:09:45.351 --> 00:09:47.019 line:95%,end
You're getting too big.

LESLIE: <i>I'm happy to be back,</i>

00:10:03.536 --> 00:10:06.105 line:5%,start
I'll deal with these dance moms

gets this opportunity

00:10:08.107 --> 00:10:09.075 line:95%,end

ABBY: Hey, hey.
How are you?

00:10:17.383 --> 00:10:18.451 line:95%,end
We're good.

00:10:19.018 --> 00:10:19.885 line:95%,end
What's that?

00:10:19.952 --> 00:10:21.053 line:95%,end
LESLIE: Sad news.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.521 line:95%,end
Should be okay
in a couple of days.

00:10:22.588 --> 00:10:24.924 line:95%,end
The first day we show up
at the studio

00:10:24.991 --> 00:10:27.259 line:95%,end

rehearsing for this number,

<i>the night before</i>
<i>during rehearsals.</i>

00:10:33.432 --> 00:10:35.234 line:95%,end
Leslie, you're thinking
about your kid.

00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:37.336 line:95%,end
I'm thinking about that medal

00:10:37.403 --> 00:10:40.172 line:95%,end
digging into every little girl's side
as she lifts them up.

00:10:40.239 --> 00:10:41.874 line:95%,end
-I brought more tape.
-What happened?

00:10:41.941 --> 00:10:44.577 line:95%,end
I went to jump to the floor
and when I put my hand down,

00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:46.612 line:95%,end
instead of putting it flat,
I went like this.

00:10:46.679 --> 00:10:48.214 line:95%,end
Well, I've had lots
of kids break a finger.

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.349 line:95%,end
It's just a big deal
that you have to work

00:10:50.416 --> 00:10:52.084 line:95%,end
on grabbing them around the waist

00:10:52.151 --> 00:10:53.519 line:95%,end
and you're grabbing them
with a piece of metal.

00:10:53.586 --> 00:10:54.787 line:95%,end
I mean, she's going
to have to suck it up.

00:10:54.854 --> 00:10:56.222 line:95%,end
If she has to take it off,
she'll take it off.

00:10:56.288 --> 00:10:57.690 line:95%,end
Go get ready.
Get warmed up.

Chloe's catching up with Payton.
Look at her.

00:11:07.299 --> 00:11:08.734 line:95%,end
She's really getting tall.

00:11:08.801 --> 00:11:12.004 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: It's not that Payton
is exorbitantly tall for her age,

00:11:12.071 --> 00:11:14.573 line:95%,end
it's just that she's dancer
with kids four years younger than her.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.642 line:95%,end
Abby has a tendency
to typecast people.

00:11:16.709 --> 00:11:18.377 line:95%,end
Last time Payton was the bully.

00:11:18.444 --> 00:11:20.312 line:95%,end
This time she's hunting children.

00:11:20.379 --> 00:11:21.847 line:95%,end
Do you think
she was a good choice

00:11:21.914 --> 00:11:23.049 line:95%,end
to come in on this dance?

00:11:23.115 --> 00:11:25.818 line:95%,end
Melissa said last night
that she's been bullying Maddie a lot.

00:11:25.885 --> 00:11:26.919 line:95%,end
How is she bullying her?

00:11:27.486 --> 00:11:28.988 line:95%,end
She kept telling her,
you're doing that wrong.

00:11:29.055 --> 00:11:30.690 line:95%,end
You're doing that wrong.
Move on, you're in my way.

00:11:30.756 --> 00:11:32.892 line:95%,end
You told Christi and not me?

00:11:33.926 --> 00:11:34.960 line:95%,end
I didn't want you to yell at her.

00:11:35.027 --> 00:11:38.230 line:95%,end
You go and tell other people
before you tell me?


00:11:42.468 --> 00:11:44.203 line:95%,end
(tense music playing)

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:45.271 line:95%,end
How is she bullying her?

She kept telling her,
you're doing that wrong.

00:11:46.972 --> 00:11:48.607 line:95%,end
You're doing that wrong.
Move on, you're in my way.

00:11:48.674 --> 00:11:50.976 line:95%,end
-Move it.
-Wait, that's bullying and being mean?

00:11:51.043 --> 00:11:54.547 line:5%,start
Melissa says that Payton
was bullying her daughter,

00:11:54.613 --> 00:11:58.784 line:5%,start
but really just can't give me
specific examples of what she did.

<i>It's all while lies.</i>
<i>Women are brutal liars.</i>

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:02.621 line:95%,end
Telling somebody
that they're not doing it right

00:12:02.688 --> 00:12:03.522 line:95%,end
is not bullying them.

00:12:03.589 --> 00:12:06.625 line:95%,end
Tell me what the bullying, bullying--
if you know what the word means.

00:12:06.692 --> 00:12:08.728 line:95%,end
-What?
-That's an imbalance of power.

00:12:08.794 --> 00:12:11.230 line:95%,end
So if you're using your power
in a way that's unbalanced,

00:12:11.297 --> 00:12:13.632 line:95%,end
like a child
might be six inches taller,

00:12:13.699 --> 00:12:16.001 line:95%,end
being more aggressive,
even verbally,

00:12:16.068 --> 00:12:17.169 line:95%,end
that would be
considered bullying.

00:12:17.236 --> 00:12:19.038 line:95%,end
And she said,
please don't tell Leslie

00:12:19.105 --> 00:12:20.606 line:95%,end
because she's going to
really yell at Payton

00:12:20.673 --> 00:12:21.741 line:95%,end
and Payton's going to get in trouble.

00:12:21.807 --> 00:12:22.975 line:95%,end
Well, she should get in trouble.

00:12:23.042 --> 00:12:24.710 line:95%,end
I don't want to get involved.
I don't want to--

00:12:24.777 --> 00:12:26.579 line:95%,end
That's your answer
for everything, isn't it?

00:12:26.645 --> 00:12:28.247 line:95%,end
-What is?
-LESLIE: Guess what?

00:12:28.314 --> 00:12:31.484 line:95%,end
You got yourself involved

Payton is a good girl.

You're damn right,

00:12:42.995 --> 00:12:44.096 line:95%,end
Don't talk about my daughter.

I don't care if you don't like me.

You're no one's friend up here.
No one wants you here, Leslie.

Oh, guess what?
I'm here.

Run.
Move upstage.

she can do the routine.

And it's lyrical
and I'm really excited

00:14:17.823 --> 00:14:19.358 line:5%,start
because I get to play Dorothy.

00:14:19.425 --> 00:14:22.661 line:95%,end

trying to find my way home,

00:14:22.728 --> 00:14:24.997 line:95%,end

about Maddie going up

00:14:27.299 --> 00:14:29.101 line:95%,end
against 10 and 11-year-olds?

00:14:29.168 --> 00:14:30.336 line:95%,end
No, I think it's good.

00:14:30.402 --> 00:14:32.304 line:95%,end
I mean, I think it's good
that they get a challenge.

00:14:32.371 --> 00:14:34.206 line:95%,end
Abby likes to put a lot
of pressure on the girls,

00:14:34.273 --> 00:14:35.774 line:95%,end
and she'll tell Maddie,

00:14:35.841 --> 00:14:37.943 line:95%,end
you're nine but you have
to dance like a 12-year-old.

<i>When you're three years</i>
<i>older than somebody,</i>

00:14:39.478 --> 00:14:41.614 line:95%,end
<i>you have a lot more technique</i>
<i>and a lot more experience,</i>

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:45.417 line:95%,end
a lot more hours dancing,
so it's going to be tough.

ABBY: <i>Every dance that Maddie</i>

00:14:52.825 --> 00:14:55.895 line:95%,end
She just portrays characters very well.


00:14:55.961 --> 00:14:58.030 line:95%,end
<i>So when I give her</i>
<i>a character to portray,</i>

00:14:58.097 --> 00:14:59.632 line:95%,end
<i>it helps her get into the story.</i>

00:14:59.698 --> 00:15:01.634 line:95%,end
<i>It helps her find her emotion.</i>

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.202 line:95%,end
<i>And she's going</i>
<i>to use it on stage,</i>

00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:05.070 line:95%,end
and that's very important
when you're doing a lyric

00:15:05.137 --> 00:15:06.305 line:95%,end
or a contemporary routine.

00:15:06.372 --> 00:15:08.340 line:95%,end
Remember, this is Star Power.

It's the largest competition

00:15:12.544 --> 00:15:14.146 line:95%,end
They have three different levels.

00:15:14.213 --> 00:15:17.316 line:95%,end
You are in the highest,
most advanced level.

00:15:17.383 --> 00:15:19.051 line:95%,end
Today and tomorrow
and you're there,

00:15:19.118 --> 00:15:20.886 line:95%,end

been working on these routines

00:15:20.953 --> 00:15:22.588 line:95%,end
since September maybe.

00:15:22.655 --> 00:15:25.024 line:95%,end

this is Star Power.

Chloe's is called
"What Goes Around"

00:15:47.079 --> 00:15:49.815 line:95%,end

Chloe, you have two days

00:15:58.924 --> 00:16:01.894 line:95%,end
I'm seeing a little flirting,
but I'm not seeing the evil.

I'm going to step on whoever
I can to get ahead.

00:16:05.698 --> 00:16:06.765 line:95%,end

<i>and posing and not a lot of dancing.</i>

00:16:13.806 --> 00:16:17.276 line:95%,end
And of course, I'm worried
because I've been here before

00:16:17.343 --> 00:16:19.445 line:95%,end

Maddie's going to do

00:16:19.511 --> 00:16:21.647 line:95%,end

Make sure
you're using your arms.

Lo and behold,

00:17:19.171 --> 00:17:21.106 line:95%,end
they said sure,
but you can't do the same number.

00:17:21.173 --> 00:17:23.275 line:95%,end
I'm trying to do something
that I've never done before.

Having a kid in two titles
in two hours,

00:17:26.745 --> 00:17:28.881 line:95%,end
take advantage

<i>Maddie knows some old routines,</i>

down my throat about,
how come you get to go

everybody else gets to go?

has potential

00:19:56.895 --> 00:19:59.932 line:95%,end
You have to be
so captivating in your faces

00:19:59.998 --> 00:20:01.967 line:95%,end
that you capture those judges.

00:20:02.034 --> 00:20:03.535 line:95%,end
Go get a drink.

00:20:05.137 --> 00:20:08.140 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:20:10.008 --> 00:20:11.109 line:95%,end
When I tried to lift her up

00:20:11.176 --> 00:20:13.579 line:95%,end
like, because she
didn't do anything.

00:20:13.645 --> 00:20:15.681 line:95%,end
Well, are you going
to be okay on Saturday?

00:20:15.747 --> 00:20:16.882 line:95%,end
Payton, you can't--

00:20:16.949 --> 00:20:19.218 line:95%,end
-Well, I was gonna be.
-You have to be okay on Saturday.

00:20:19.284 --> 00:20:22.254 line:95%,end
<i>Payton's complaining</i>
<i>about the finger after this dance,</i>

00:20:22.321 --> 00:20:25.924 line:5%,start
and I think it's important for kids
to be tough in the dance world.

00:20:25.991 --> 00:20:28.594 line:95%,end
So she just needs to suck it up
and get through the dance.

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:30.062 line:95%,end
You have a lot of lifting to do.

00:20:30.128 --> 00:20:31.363 line:95%,end
You should have
been more careful.

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:32.431 line:95%,end
It wasn't my fault,
she didn't lift herself.

00:20:32.497 --> 00:20:34.666 line:95%,end
I told you to wrap it
better than that, too.

00:20:34.733 --> 00:20:37.936 line:95%,end
I am nervous that Abby
would cut Payton from this dance.

00:20:39.438 --> 00:20:42.207 line:5%,start
(upbeat music playing)

00:20:48.814 --> 00:20:50.115 line:95%,end
ABBY: Girls, get your stuff.

00:20:50.182 --> 00:20:52.117 line:95%,end
<i>As the bus pulls</i>
<i>into the parking lot,</i>

00:20:52.184 --> 00:20:53.785 line:5%,start
I'm going, oh my goodness.

00:20:53.852 --> 00:20:55.520 line:95%,end
<i>What did we get ourselves into?</i>

00:20:55.587 --> 00:20:57.522 line:95%,end
Come on, girls, here we go.


00:20:57.923 --> 00:20:59.258 line:95%,end
Game faces.

00:21:00.125 --> 00:21:02.461 line:95%,end
<i>Star Power,</i>
<i>this is a huge competition.</i>

00:21:02.527 --> 00:21:04.863 line:95%,end
<i>It's the largest competition</i>
<i>in the United States.</i>

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:06.164 line:95%,end
Lots of amazing dancers.

00:21:06.231 --> 00:21:08.033 line:95%,end
<i>And it's their 25th anniversary,</i>

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.168 line:95%,end
so I know we're going to have
a fight on our hands.

00:21:10.235 --> 00:21:11.837 line:95%,end
<i>It's going to be a tough competition,</i>

00:21:11.903 --> 00:21:14.273 line:95%,end
<i>just because of the numbers</i>
<i>of people that are here.</i>

00:21:14.339 --> 00:21:15.207 line:95%,end
It's crazy.

00:21:15.274 --> 00:21:17.476 line:95%,end
The group is first, I believe. Yes?

00:21:17.542 --> 00:21:20.512 line:95%,end
(mellow music playing)

00:21:23.482 --> 00:21:25.651 line:95%,end
Girls, remember
what character you're playing

00:21:25.717 --> 00:21:26.752 line:95%,end
when you step out there.

00:21:26.818 --> 00:21:29.121 line:95%,end
You're warriors.
You're survivors.

00:21:29.187 --> 00:21:30.522 line:95%,end
So Payton, how's the finger?

00:21:30.589 --> 00:21:31.923 line:95%,end
It's okay.

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:33.358 line:95%,end
Okay?

00:21:33.425 --> 00:21:35.027 line:95%,end
Can I hear a good?

00:21:35.827 --> 00:21:38.096 line:95%,end
LESLIE: No, it's not good.
It's not okay.

00:21:38.163 --> 00:21:38.997 line:95%,end
But it's her finger.

00:21:39.064 --> 00:21:41.233 line:95%,end
It's not her knee
or her ankle or her thigh.

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:42.634 line:95%,end
She's got three lifting parts.

00:21:42.701 --> 00:21:45.804 line:95%,end
I just hope she doesn't
stop dancing or holds back

00:21:45.871 --> 00:21:47.539 line:95%,end
because she's afraid
of her finger getting hurt.

00:21:47.606 --> 00:21:48.440 line:95%,end
It's going to hurt.

00:21:48.507 --> 00:21:50.142 line:95%,end
I'm not going to lie to you,
it's going to hurt.

00:21:50.208 --> 00:21:52.844 line:95%,end
For two minutes and 30 seconds,
it's going to be very painful.

00:21:53.345 --> 00:21:55.614 line:95%,end
And then you stick it in ice,
get the splint back on,

00:21:55.681 --> 00:21:56.982 line:95%,end
and continue to heal.

00:21:57.049 --> 00:21:59.251 line:95%,end
LESLIE: There's no way
she can dance with it.

00:21:59.318 --> 00:22:01.253 line:95%,end
-The splint? No.
-Yes.

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:02.921 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>Uh, hello?</i>

00:22:02.988 --> 00:22:05.190 line:5%,start
Haven't you been here before?
Of course not.

00:22:05.257 --> 00:22:06.792 line:5%,start
Maybe if you sprayed a cover.

00:22:06.858 --> 00:22:07.793 line:95%,end
It's a finger.

00:22:07.859 --> 00:22:09.094 line:95%,end
So she's going to look bad
in her wedding pictures.

00:22:09.161 --> 00:22:10.128 line:95%,end
Oh, well.

00:22:10.195 --> 00:22:11.763 line:95%,end
That's not going
to hurt her dancing.

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:13.832 line:95%,end
Didn't some guy
survive in some cliff

00:22:13.899 --> 00:22:15.834 line:95%,end
and he ate his arm and he's fine?

00:22:16.535 --> 00:22:18.270 line:95%,end
There's your answer.
Suck it up.

00:22:20.639 --> 00:22:22.240 line:95%,end
KELLY: I got a picture from Brooke.

00:22:22.307 --> 00:22:24.843 line:95%,end
MOMS: Oh, I want to see.

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:26.345 line:95%,end
MOM: Aw.

00:22:26.411 --> 00:22:28.246 line:95%,end
LESLIE: Oh, she's beautiful.

00:22:28.313 --> 00:22:29.147 line:95%,end
She does.

00:22:29.214 --> 00:22:30.482 line:95%,end
Gorgeous.

00:22:30.549 --> 00:22:33.518 line:95%,end
Oh, she looks like a big girl.

00:22:33.585 --> 00:22:37.022 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>I'm very happy with my decision</i>
<i>to send Brooke to the school dance</i>

00:22:37.089 --> 00:22:38.590 line:95%,end
<i>instead of coming</i>
<i>to the competition.</i>

00:22:38.657 --> 00:22:41.593 line:5%,start
I think that, you know,
coming all this way

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:43.028 line:95%,end
to do a two-minute number,

00:22:44.062 --> 00:22:46.098 line:95%,end
<i>she'll do another competition</i>
<i>next weekend.</i>

00:22:46.164 --> 00:22:48.200 line:95%,end
You can't ever do
your eighth grade farewell again.

00:22:48.266 --> 00:22:50.635 line:95%,end
I need to save the text
that says I miss you.

00:22:50.702 --> 00:22:52.537 line:95%,end
Now she's going to go
and kiss somebody

00:22:52.604 --> 00:22:53.638 line:95%,end
and she won't miss you.

00:22:55.173 --> 00:22:58.176 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:23:04.683 --> 00:23:05.684 line:95%,end
Now, listen to me.

00:23:06.218 --> 00:23:08.253 line:95%,end
Do not walk back
in this dressing room

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:11.189 line:95%,end
and repeat what you did the last time,
do you understand?

00:23:11.256 --> 00:23:13.091 line:95%,end
Do not come back
to this dressing room

00:23:13.158 --> 00:23:15.494 line:95%,end
and think that you were fabulous
and everybody else screwed up.

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:16.762 line:95%,end
<i>I want to talk to Payton</i>

00:23:16.828 --> 00:23:18.764 line:95%,end
about the last time
she joined this team

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:20.632 line:95%,end
and how her mouth
got her into trouble

00:23:20.699 --> 00:23:21.967 line:95%,end
and everybody hated her.

00:23:22.033 --> 00:23:23.935 line:95%,end
I thought that I was better
than most of the people.

00:23:24.002 --> 00:23:26.671 line:95%,end
ABBY: You thought you were better
than most of the people in this group?

00:23:27.572 --> 00:23:28.940 line:95%,end
Oh, that's cocky.

00:23:29.541 --> 00:23:32.544 line:95%,end
You can be a leader
and you can be a role model,

00:23:32.611 --> 00:23:34.012 line:95%,end
but don't be cocky.

00:23:34.079 --> 00:23:35.747 line:95%,end
When you set foot
in this dressing room,

00:23:35.814 --> 00:23:38.483 line:95%,end
100% decorum,
manners, etiquette.

00:23:39.251 --> 00:23:41.219 line:95%,end
You're a natural
born leader, yes?

00:23:41.286 --> 00:23:44.356 line:95%,end
-Yes.
-But I'm the leader, understood?

00:23:44.423 --> 00:23:45.323 line:95%,end
Yes.

<i>Star Power is the biggest</i>

00:23:51.797 --> 00:23:54.733 line:95%,end
<i>Winning there means a lot,</i>
<i>a lot to me</i>

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:56.468 line:5%,start

to the dance community.

Ugh!

Nia, where does the head go
on the push away?

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:10.715 line:95%,end
<i>It's getting old.</i>
<i>It's getting boring.</i>

00:24:10.782 --> 00:24:11.783 line:95%,end
It's getting monotonous.

00:24:12.517 --> 00:24:13.485 line:95%,end
Are we ready?

00:24:13.552 --> 00:24:14.853 line:95%,end
All right, we're on the move.

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:16.555 line:95%,end
We got to go, go, go, go, go.
Let's go.

Game faces, girls.

00:24:17.689 --> 00:24:19.758 line:95%,end
And when I say game faces,
I really mean it this time.

00:24:19.825 --> 00:24:20.892 line:95%,end
It is a game out there.

Maddie, "Looking for a Place Called Home."

00:35:06.671 --> 00:35:09.707 line:5%,start
(cheering)

00:35:09.774 --> 00:35:11.442 line:95%,end
Congratulations.

00:35:11.509 --> 00:35:15.680 line:95%,end
MADDIE: I am so excited that
I won Junior Miss Star Power and a crown,

00:35:15.746 --> 00:35:17.415 line:95%,end
and I hope I can win another one.

00:35:17.482 --> 00:35:18.850 line:95%,end
The studio is?

00:35:18.916 --> 00:35:20.151 line:95%,end
Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:35:20.218 --> 00:35:23.321 line:95%,end
ABBY: So Maddie is Junior Miss Star Power

00:35:23.387 --> 00:35:24.956 line:95%,end
at their 25th anniversary,

00:35:25.022 --> 00:35:28.259 line:95%,end
<i>during the biggest competition</i>
<i>in the United States,</i>

00:35:28.326 --> 00:35:31.095 line:95%,end
in an age division
where she's on the youngest side.

00:35:31.162 --> 00:35:33.965 line:95%,end
Our top scoring nine to 11
soloists, great job.

00:35:34.932 --> 00:35:37.502 line:95%,end
That does it for us tonight.

00:35:37.568 --> 00:35:40.638 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>Maddie's choreography</i>
<i>and Chloe's choreography</i>

00:35:40.705 --> 00:35:42.940 line:95%,end
were not even in the same stratosphere.

00:35:43.541 --> 00:35:45.476 line:95%,end
I thought Chloe's solo was very technical.

00:35:45.543 --> 00:35:47.211 line:95%,end
No, it wasn't.

00:35:47.278 --> 00:35:49.080 line:95%,end
It had one set of turns at the end.

00:35:49.147 --> 00:35:50.681 line:95%,end
You're just a poor loser.

00:35:50.748 --> 00:35:52.250 line:95%,end
She did fabulous.

00:35:52.316 --> 00:35:53.518 line:95%,end
She was amazing.

00:35:53.584 --> 00:35:56.320 line:95%,end
Her choreography didn't allow her to win.

00:35:56.387 --> 00:35:58.422 line:95%,end
<i>I am getting so upset</i>

00:35:58.489 --> 00:36:00.825 line:95%,end
<i>because I know that there is no chance</i>

00:36:00.892 --> 00:36:04.262 line:95%,end
that Chloe has to even come close
to beating Maddie.

00:36:04.929 --> 00:36:05.863 line:95%,end
ABBY: Outstanding.

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:07.298 line:95%,end
Chloe, wonderful.

00:36:07.365 --> 00:36:08.966 line:95%,end
Maddie, I can't believe
you won that title.

00:36:10.067 --> 00:36:11.235 line:95%,end
But you know what?

00:36:11.302 --> 00:36:12.970 line:95%,end
You're only as good
as your last performance.

00:36:14.005 --> 00:36:16.774 line:95%,end
So Melissa, I'm taking her over
to the other competition

00:36:16.841 --> 00:36:18.943 line:95%,end
and she's going to do "Cry."

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:20.545 line:95%,end
What?

00:36:21.779 --> 00:36:22.980 line:95%,end
ABBY: Maddie, I need you to get dressed

00:36:23.047 --> 00:36:24.649 line:95%,end
and I need to fix your hair.

00:36:26.417 --> 00:36:27.652 line:95%,end
All right, ready?

00:36:28.152 --> 00:36:29.520 line:95%,end
Come on, baby doll.

00:36:30.288 --> 00:36:33.758 line:95%,end
Now there's situation where
you should have spoke up and said,

00:36:33.824 --> 00:36:35.660 line:95%,end
why wouldn't Chloe be going?

00:36:35.726 --> 00:36:37.395 line:95%,end
Maddie, you understand

00:36:37.461 --> 00:36:38.663 line:95%,end
that you just won this whole thing?

00:36:38.729 --> 00:36:39.931 line:95%,end
You can win that whole thing.

00:36:40.898 --> 00:36:41.899 line:95%,end
I mean, no pressure.

00:36:41.966 --> 00:36:45.269 line:95%,end
KELLY: It's blatantly obvious
that she brought a costume for Maddie

00:36:45.336 --> 00:36:47.672 line:95%,end
and didn't bring one
for Chloe or Nia or Paige or Payton.

00:36:47.738 --> 00:36:50.208 line:95%,end
Because she guaranteed you
she practiced that solo this week.

00:36:50.274 --> 00:36:51.108 line:95%,end
Yeah.

00:36:51.175 --> 00:36:54.579 line:95%,end
I know Melissa knew that Maddie
was going to do two solos.

00:36:54.645 --> 00:36:57.748 line:95%,end
<i>If Abby sprung</i>
<i>doing a solo on her like that</i>

00:36:57.815 --> 00:37:00.518 line:95%,end
<i>and she wasn't prepared,</i>
<i>Maddie would have been a nervous wreck,</i>

00:37:00.585 --> 00:37:02.687 line:95%,end
but she was cool as a cucumber

00:37:02.753 --> 00:37:03.721 line:95%,end
and was prepared.

00:37:03.788 --> 00:37:05.623 line:95%,end
Maddie, you walk into the competition,
don't forget.

00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:06.757 line:95%,end
Game face on.

00:37:07.592 --> 00:37:08.526 line:95%,end
Nose in the air.

00:37:08.593 --> 00:37:09.927 line:95%,end
Get out there and do your best.

00:37:09.994 --> 00:37:14.165 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Our dance teacher
set these kids up to fail.

00:37:14.232 --> 00:37:16.500 line:95%,end
She knew Maddie
was going to win that dance.

00:37:16.567 --> 00:37:18.636 line:95%,end
Your daughter was taught a solo.

00:37:18.703 --> 00:37:21.405 line:95%,end
She got a beautiful costume,
just like Maddie did.

00:37:21.472 --> 00:37:24.308 line:95%,end
You should know that
about being a dance mom at this point.

00:37:24.375 --> 00:37:25.610 line:95%,end
I'm ready to go. I'm done.

00:37:25.676 --> 00:37:26.777 line:95%,end
Good.

00:37:27.612 --> 00:37:29.614 line:95%,end
Don't let the door hit you on the way out.

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:31.015 line:95%,end
Can't wait to have you back.

00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:34.318 line:95%,end
ABBY: This is good.
Let's go right in that door, Melissa.

00:37:34.385 --> 00:37:35.219 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Okay.

00:37:35.286 --> 00:37:36.387 line:5%,start
ABBY: Okay, go.


00:37:36.454 --> 00:37:38.756 line:5%,start
Go, go, go, go, go.
Maddie, don't wait for me. Run.

00:37:39.557 --> 00:37:42.560 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:37:43.427 --> 00:37:45.363 line:95%,end
What's her number?

00:37:46.864 --> 00:37:48.165 line:95%,end
Am I competing?

00:37:48.232 --> 00:37:50.067 line:95%,end
MADDIE: I'm about to go on for "Cry"

00:37:50.134 --> 00:37:53.304 line:95%,end
and I'm very excited
that I get to do it again,

00:37:53.371 --> 00:37:55.072 line:95%,end
<i>but also kind of nervous</i>

00:37:55.139 --> 00:37:57.375 line:95%,end
because I really want to do my best

00:37:57.441 --> 00:37:58.776 line:95%,end
and try to win another crown.

00:37:58.843 --> 00:38:00.778 line:95%,end
Just got that award
about lighting up the stage.

00:38:00.845 --> 00:38:02.513 line:95%,end
That's what I need you to do, yes?

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:03.748 line:95%,end
And if the dance is "Cry,"

00:38:03.814 --> 00:38:05.716 line:95%,end
every one of those judges
should be in tears.

00:38:05.783 --> 00:38:06.717 line:95%,end
-Got it?
-Okay.

00:38:06.784 --> 00:38:08.252 line:95%,end
Yes? Let's do it, babe.

00:38:09.253 --> 00:38:13.391 line:95%,end
ANNOUNCER: <i>Please welcome, "Cry," 326.</i>

00:38:17.395 --> 00:38:21.265 line:5%,start
<i>âª Well, I, I guess it's been a while âª</i>

00:38:21.332 --> 00:38:23.901 line:95%,end
<i>âª Since I've seen the sunshine âª</i>

00:38:23.968 --> 00:38:26.170 line:95%,end
<i>âª Since I have smiled âª</i>

00:38:28.606 --> 00:38:31.242 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I'm actually backstage
watching Maddie do her solo

00:38:31.309 --> 00:38:33.411 line:95%,end
because there wasn't any time
for us to sit down.

00:38:33.477 --> 00:38:35.813 line:95%,end
<i>Maddie looks beautiful</i>
<i>out there doing her solo.</i>

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:37.381 line:95%,end
I was really proud of her,

00:38:37.448 --> 00:38:39.784 line:95%,end
but I don't know what the other
competition is like here.

00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:45.690 line:95%,end
<i>âª And I âª</i>

00:38:45.756 --> 00:38:48.659 line:95%,end
<i>âª I don't want to do anything but cry âª</i>

00:38:52.029 --> 00:38:55.032 line:95%,end
(applause)

00:39:03.474 --> 00:39:04.608 line:95%,end
Hug me.

00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:07.445 line:95%,end
I love you.

00:39:07.511 --> 00:39:09.413 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>That child worked so hard.</i>

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:12.416 line:95%,end
She puts 100% in every class she takes.

00:39:12.483 --> 00:39:14.885 line:95%,end
She deserves to hold her head high.

00:39:14.952 --> 00:39:18.189 line:5%,start
(cheering)

00:39:18.255 --> 00:39:19.790 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>So here comes the awards.</i>

00:39:19.857 --> 00:39:22.159 line:95%,end
Can we do it, two for two? I don't know.

00:39:23.894 --> 00:39:26.464 line:95%,end
We have a second runner up

00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:31.135 line:95%,end
going to entry number 343,
Megan Prow with "Janet."

00:39:31.202 --> 00:39:32.636 line:95%,end
(applause)

00:39:32.703 --> 00:39:35.973 line:95%,end
And first runner up
for Junior Miss Star Power

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:39.677 line:95%,end
is going to enter number 345,
Heather Spears with "River Deep."

00:39:39.744 --> 00:39:42.113 line:95%,end
(applause)

00:39:42.179 --> 00:39:44.281 line:95%,end
And your Junior Miss Star Power

00:39:44.348 --> 00:39:46.550 line:95%,end
here at Woodbridge 2012 will be...

00:39:50.955 --> 00:39:54.191 line:95%,end
entry number 326, Maddie with "Cry."

00:39:55.226 --> 00:39:57.795 line:5%,start
(cheering)

00:39:57.862 --> 00:39:59.563 line:95%,end
Maddie was the Junior Miss Star Power

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:01.866 line:95%,end
<i>at the second competition that day.</i>

00:40:01.932 --> 00:40:05.403 line:95%,end
Within two hours,
that child won two titles

00:40:05.469 --> 00:40:07.238 line:95%,end
at two different competitions.

00:40:07.304 --> 00:40:08.973 line:95%,end
And what studio do you represent?

00:40:09.039 --> 00:40:10.307 line:95%,end
Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:40:10.374 --> 00:40:11.375 line:95%,end
Congratulations.

00:40:12.143 --> 00:40:12.977 line:95%,end
Who does that?

00:40:13.043 --> 00:40:14.812 line:95%,end
There she is.

00:40:14.879 --> 00:40:16.414 line:95%,end
(cheering)

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:20.184 line:95%,end
I have to tell you,
I thought this was very--this is sneaky.

00:40:20.251 --> 00:40:21.285 line:95%,end
This was sneaky right here.

00:40:21.352 --> 00:40:22.753 line:95%,end
Whoo-hoo.

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:24.622 line:5%,start
Yes. Give me a kiss.

00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:27.191 line:5%,start
Maddie had a solo.

00:40:27.258 --> 00:40:29.827 line:5%,start
They just so happened
to have a costume in their bag.

00:40:29.894 --> 00:40:32.763 line:5%,start
Just so happened Maddie
had a three-hour private that week.

00:40:32.830 --> 00:40:34.698 line:5%,start
This is the (bleep) that happens.

00:40:34.765 --> 00:40:37.001 line:5%,start
Two titles in one day.

00:40:37.067 --> 00:40:39.203 line:5%,start
See? It's worth it sometimes, isn't it?

00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:41.038 line:5%,start
I'm hanging. I'm hanging. I'm hanging.

00:40:41.105 --> 00:40:42.339 line:5%,start
Yes, good girl.

00:40:42.406 --> 00:40:46.811 line:5%,start
We're bitter about the way
the deck is constantly stacked.

00:40:46.877 --> 00:40:48.646 line:5%,start
That's what you're missing, Leslie.

00:40:48.712 --> 00:40:51.382 line:5%,start
You don't live it so you don't know it.
