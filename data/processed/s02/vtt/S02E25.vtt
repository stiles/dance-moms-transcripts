ABBY: <i>Previously on </i>Dance Moms...

00:00:02.369 --> 00:00:06.573 line:5%,start
This is the 2012
Abby Lee Dance Company concert.

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:08.141 line:5%,start
You're getting thrown
to the wolves, woman.

00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:10.110 line:5%,start
They're gonna chew you up
and spit you out.

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:11.011 line:5%,start
Just be prepared.

00:00:11.077 --> 00:00:12.379 line:5%,start
-You left.
-So we left. That's right.

00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:16.082 line:5%,start
You always have excuses
why your kids get what they get.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:18.918 line:5%,start
Maddie, I asked to do a solo.
You said no.

00:00:18.985 --> 00:00:20.387 line:5%,start
I'm giving this part to Chloe.

00:00:20.453 --> 00:00:21.287 line:5%,start
You need AA meeting.

00:00:21.354 --> 00:00:23.223 line:5%,start
Now you need to go
and see a therapist.

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:24.124 line:5%,start
You're a (bleep) liar.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.160 line:5%,start
ABBY: Our junior winner
is Miss Maddie Ziegler.

00:00:27.227 --> 00:00:28.928 line:5%,start
(cheering)

00:00:28.995 --> 00:00:30.730 line:5%,start
ABBY: <i>Coming up on</i> Dance Moms...

00:00:30.797 --> 00:00:32.399 line:5%,start
-She's allowed to dance.
-Yay!

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:33.800 line:5%,start
But she's not
allowed to do tricks.

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:34.734 line:5%,start
Okay.

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:37.037 line:5%,start
Just when I thought
it couldn't get any crazier...

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:38.138 line:5%,start
We're here to see Abby.

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:39.039 line:5%,start
...it got crazier.

00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:40.607 line:5%,start
-You're Kaya.
-I'm Kaya. This is Nicaya.

00:00:40.673 --> 00:00:42.008 line:5%,start
What are all the girls looking at?

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:44.177 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: You don't just get to walk in
and be on a competition team.

00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:45.512 line:5%,start
So far, I have just walked in.

00:00:45.578 --> 00:00:47.347 line:5%,start
KELLY: Abby,
just tell us what you're doing.

00:00:47.414 --> 00:00:49.315 line:5%,start
Is Paige dancing
in the dance or not?

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:51.651 line:5%,start
ABBY: If she's injured,
she shouldn't be on stage.

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:52.786 line:5%,start
KELLY: I'm done!

00:00:52.852 --> 00:00:53.753 line:5%,start
(door slams)

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.722 line:5%,start
KELLY: (bleep) my kid!

00:00:57.057 --> 00:00:59.392 line:95%,end
(theme music playing)

(upbeat music playing)

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:16.076 line:95%,end
Come on, girls!
Let's go!

00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:17.277 line:95%,end
Come on.

00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:25.218 line:95%,end
Congratulations
on a successful dance concert.

00:01:25.285 --> 00:01:26.719 line:95%,end
(applause)

00:01:26.786 --> 00:01:29.589 line:95%,end
ABBY: All of your performances
were amazing.

00:01:29.656 --> 00:01:31.825 line:95%,end
You showed the entire
city of Pittsburgh

00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:36.096 line:95%,end
why we are ranked
nationally in the country

00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:38.298 line:95%,end
as one of the top dance studios.

00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:40.667 line:5%,start
The dance concert
was a smashing success.

00:01:41.034 --> 00:01:43.970 line:95%,end
<i>I thought the kids</i>
<i>were outstanding</i>

00:01:44.037 --> 00:01:45.605 line:95%,end
<i>from beginning to end.</i>

00:01:45.672 --> 00:01:49.876 line:95%,end
But keep in mind,
this is the road to nationals.

00:01:50.443 --> 00:01:52.979 line:95%,end
This is where it gets tough,

00:01:53.046 --> 00:01:56.416 line:95%,end
because we will be
traveling to California

00:01:56.483 --> 00:01:59.352 line:95%,end
to go to the iHollywood competition.

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:01.554 line:95%,end
(cheering)

00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:03.123 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>This competition is a big deal.</i>

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.392 line:95%,end
And that's why it's important
on our road to nationals.

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:09.929 line:95%,end
I want to put my little kids
from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,

00:02:09.996 --> 00:02:12.665 line:95%,end
up against the big guns
and see what happens.

00:02:12.732 --> 00:02:14.234 line:95%,end
At the bottom of the pyramid,

00:02:14.834 --> 00:02:16.669 line:95%,end
I have Paige.

00:02:16.736 --> 00:02:18.738 line:95%,end
You couldn't do
too much with the boot.

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:20.974 line:95%,end
I understand that.
I want it to heal.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.376 line:95%,end
You were supposed to see
a doctor at four weeks.

00:02:23.443 --> 00:02:24.611 line:95%,end
She's going this week.

00:02:24.677 --> 00:02:26.045 line:95%,end
So let's hope, Paige,

00:02:26.112 --> 00:02:27.747 line:95%,end
that you're going to be dancing again.

00:02:28.348 --> 00:02:29.282 line:95%,end
Next,

00:02:30.683 --> 00:02:31.518 line:95%,end
Brooke.

00:02:31.584 --> 00:02:34.387 line:95%,end
Brooke, the hip hop dance
really wasn't your thing.

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:36.823 line:95%,end
Next...

00:02:37.957 --> 00:02:38.892 line:95%,end
Mackenzie.

00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.261 line:95%,end
Kenzie, you went out there

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:43.163 line:95%,end
and you looked
just like the big girls.

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:46.332 line:95%,end
<i>However, I thought</i>
<i>the hip hop choreography</i>

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:47.500 line:95%,end
<i>was a bit over your head.</i>

00:02:48.401 --> 00:02:51.671 line:95%,end
Moving up the pyramid,
I have Nia.

00:02:51.738 --> 00:02:53.206 line:95%,end
You received the award

00:02:53.773 --> 00:02:55.341 line:95%,end
for the most improved student,

00:02:55.742 --> 00:02:57.944 line:95%,end
and that is something
to be very proud of.

00:02:58.011 --> 00:03:02.215 line:95%,end
However, like I've said before,
do not rest on your laurels.

00:03:02.282 --> 00:03:03.316 line:95%,end
Next,

00:03:04.083 --> 00:03:05.151 line:95%,end
Chloe...

00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:09.522 line:95%,end
Chloe, "Trapped,"
you did a great job in the role.

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:12.425 line:95%,end
And at the top
of the pyramid is Maddie.

00:03:12.492 --> 00:03:15.361 line:95%,end
Maddie, you're on top of the pyramid

00:03:15.428 --> 00:03:18.364 line:95%,end
because you won the scholarship
in your age division.

00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:21.434 line:95%,end
(cheering)

00:03:22.101 --> 00:03:25.572 line:95%,end
Kendall, you can see
you're not on the pyramid yet.

00:03:25.638 --> 00:03:28.241 line:95%,end
Keep working, keep trying,

00:03:28.308 --> 00:03:30.076 line:95%,end
and you might get on this team.

00:03:30.143 --> 00:03:32.245 line:5%,start
I think Abby's just
playing games with me.

00:03:32.312 --> 00:03:35.481 line:5%,start
She is torturing me
and she's torturing Kendall.

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:40.153 line:95%,end
Mackenzie, you have a solo.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.387 line:95%,end
You better do the whole number.

00:03:43.022 --> 00:03:44.857 line:95%,end
Nia, you also have a solo.

00:03:44.924 --> 00:03:46.025 line:95%,end
(applause)

00:03:47.093 --> 00:03:50.663 line:95%,end
Now, I have one more
solo to give out.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:51.798 line:95%,end
Who wants it?


00:03:52.565 --> 00:03:54.067 line:95%,end
Who thinks they could do it?

00:03:56.803 --> 00:03:58.137 line:95%,end
It's going to Chloe.

00:03:59.105 --> 00:04:01.274 line:95%,end
<i>I picked Chloe</i>
<i>to do the solo this week</i>

00:04:01.341 --> 00:04:04.010 line:95%,end
because I still can't forget about Maddie

00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:06.312 line:95%,end
<i>and Melissa turning down a solo.</i>

00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:09.949 line:95%,end
Just remember, I can give the solo,

00:04:10.016 --> 00:04:11.784 line:95%,end
<i>and I can taketh away.</i>

00:04:11.851 --> 00:04:13.586 line:95%,end
Everybody is in the group routine.

00:04:13.653 --> 00:04:16.589 line:95%,end
Kendall, I am inviting you

00:04:16.656 --> 00:04:19.325 line:95%,end
to travel to California with us

00:04:19.392 --> 00:04:21.527 line:95%,end
to participate
in the group number.

00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:23.963 line:95%,end
(applause)

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.632 line:95%,end
You are dismissed.

00:04:25.698 --> 00:04:26.966 line:95%,end
Spread apart.

00:04:27.033 --> 00:04:28.368 line:95%,end
We have lots of work to do.

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.773 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.342 line:5%,start
One, two...

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:39.145 line:95%,end
You know, Abby put Paige
in this group dance.

00:04:39.212 --> 00:04:40.713 line:95%,end
I hope her foot gets cleared.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.116 line:95%,end
-When's your appointment?
-My appointment's tomorrow.

00:04:43.182 --> 00:04:46.185 line:5%,start
(tense music playing)

00:04:47.553 --> 00:04:50.790 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>The group routine</i>
<i>that we're doing is entitled,</i>

00:04:50.857 --> 00:04:52.992 line:95%,end
<i>"I Can See the Kite Flying."</i>

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:56.996 line:95%,end
Now, this piece is very important
to the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:04:57.063 --> 00:04:59.565 line:95%,end
It's by the same author

00:04:59.632 --> 00:05:02.068 line:95%,end
that wrote "Where Have
All the Children Gone."

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:05.605 line:95%,end
<i>And people recognize that</i>
<i>all over the place.</i>

00:05:05.672 --> 00:05:08.074 line:95%,end
<i>They ask me</i>
<i>all the time about the number.</i>

00:05:08.841 --> 00:05:12.278 line:95%,end
So this has
the same dark undertones.

00:05:12.345 --> 00:05:16.149 line:95%,end
<i>And the kids are actually</i>
<i>in an insane asylum.</i>

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:18.985 line:95%,end
<i>And you see them rocking</i>

00:05:19.052 --> 00:05:21.688 line:95%,end
and fidgeting throughout the piece.

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:23.423 line:95%,end
<i>I'm excited about it.</i>

00:05:23.489 --> 00:05:24.424 line:95%,end
<i>I love it.</i>

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.160 line:95%,end
I think this could be
another big winner.

00:05:27.226 --> 00:05:31.097 line:95%,end
This is quick, and quick,
and step, together.

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:32.131 line:95%,end
You're rushing that.

00:05:32.198 --> 00:05:35.702 line:95%,end
BROOKE: <i>"I See the Kite Flying"</i>
<i>is a really creepy number.</i>

00:05:35.768 --> 00:05:38.071 line:5%,start
We're all, like, mental patients.

00:05:38.137 --> 00:05:41.307 line:95%,end
<i>We see a kite, but we don't know</i>
<i>if we actually see it.</i>

00:05:41.374 --> 00:05:43.876 line:95%,end
It's like in our head, or--
I'm so confused.

00:05:43.943 --> 00:05:45.044 line:95%,end
I don't know.

00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:48.014 line:95%,end
I always told you,
Abby does weird well.

00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:50.583 line:95%,end
-So the weirder the better.
-Yeah, it'll be spectacular.

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.952 line:95%,end
No one in LA will be doing
anything like this.

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:55.288 line:95%,end
-I don't think so either.
-No.

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:56.255 line:95%,end
ABBY: Hey.

00:05:56.322 --> 00:05:58.691 line:95%,end
There's no getting out
of this group, so learn it.

00:05:58.758 --> 00:06:00.760 line:95%,end
GIANNA: Two, three, four, five.

00:06:01.527 --> 00:06:02.528 line:95%,end
<i>Seven.</i>

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:05.765 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:06:05.832 --> 00:06:07.233 line:95%,end
Hi, can I help you guys?

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.035 line:95%,end
This is Nicaya.
We're here to see Abby.

00:06:09.102 --> 00:06:10.236 line:95%,end
-Oh, yeah.
-She's expecting us.

00:06:10.303 --> 00:06:13.239 line:95%,end
-This is Nicaya.
-Hi, nice to meet you, sweetie.

00:06:13.306 --> 00:06:15.475 line:95%,end
We're looking
for a new studio to compete.

00:06:15.842 --> 00:06:17.110 line:95%,end
-ABBY: Hi.
-Hi.

00:06:17.176 --> 00:06:18.611 line:95%,end
-Hello.
-ABBY: Hi, how you doing?

00:06:18.678 --> 00:06:22.148 line:95%,end
I was approached by Kaya
and her daughter Nicaya

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:23.950 line:95%,end
after our dance concert.

00:06:24.016 --> 00:06:25.952 line:95%,end
I had no idea who the woman was.

00:06:26.018 --> 00:06:29.021 line:95%,end
But it turns out she's from St. Louis

00:06:29.088 --> 00:06:31.958 line:95%,end
from a very reputable teacher,
a colleague of mine.

00:06:32.024 --> 00:06:33.626 line:95%,end
<i>So I'm going to check the kid out.</i>

00:06:33.693 --> 00:06:34.894 line:95%,end
<i>That's the least I could do.</i>

00:06:34.961 --> 00:06:36.863 line:95%,end
-You're Kaya.
-I'm Kaya. This is Nicaya.

00:06:36.929 --> 00:06:38.464 line:95%,end
Nicaya, hi.

00:06:38.898 --> 00:06:40.133 line:95%,end
What are all the girls looking at?

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:41.300 line:95%,end
There's someone here?

00:06:41.367 --> 00:06:42.568 line:95%,end
She's inviting someone in.

00:06:42.635 --> 00:06:45.271 line:95%,end
Do you want to get your shoes
and your street clothes off?

00:06:45.338 --> 00:06:46.739 line:95%,end
And I'm going to check her
out a little bit.

00:06:46.806 --> 00:06:48.141 line:95%,end
If you want to go up
and sit with the moms,

00:06:48.207 --> 00:06:49.108 line:95%,end
you're more than welcome to.

00:06:49.175 --> 00:06:50.243 line:95%,end
All right.

ABBY: I'm always looking to make
my competition team stronger.

00:06:53.446 --> 00:06:55.648 line:95%,end
Maybe this kid
Nicaya and her mom

00:06:55.715 --> 00:06:58.618 line:95%,end
are just what my team
needs before nationals.

00:06:58.684 --> 00:07:00.653 line:95%,end
<i>There's certainly nothing</i>
<i>like a surprise or two</i>

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.021 line:95%,end
<i>to wake everybody up.</i>

00:07:02.088 --> 00:07:03.222 line:95%,end
-Hi.
-KAYA: Hello.

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:05.091 line:95%,end
-Hi, how are you?
-I'm fine.

00:07:05.158 --> 00:07:06.759 line:95%,end
-HOLLY: Good.
-I'm Melissa.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.694 line:95%,end
-What's your name?
-I'm Kaya.

00:07:08.761 --> 00:07:11.197 line:95%,end
-Kaya, pretty name. Melissa.
-Hi, I'm Holly. Nice to meet you.

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:12.899 line:95%,end
-Hi, Holly.
-I'm Kelly.

00:07:12.965 --> 00:07:14.100 line:95%,end
-Kelly.
-Christi.

00:07:14.167 --> 00:07:15.034 line:95%,end
I'm Jill.

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:17.170 line:95%,end
-So where are you from?
-I'm from St. Louis.

00:07:17.236 --> 00:07:18.404 line:95%,end
Oh, okay.

00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:19.472 line:95%,end
You moved here?

00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:20.840 line:95%,end
-Yeah.
-MOMS: Oh, okay.

00:07:20.907 --> 00:07:22.942 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>I don't know why</i>
<i>Abby constantly insists</i>

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:24.377 line:95%,end
<i>on bringing new people in.</i>

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:26.712 line:5%,start
It's bad enough when
she brings people in from the studio

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:28.848 line:5%,start
that we know and have danced with.

00:07:28.915 --> 00:07:30.183 line:95%,end
Now she's bringing
a stranger in.

00:07:30.249 --> 00:07:31.818 line:95%,end
<i>I just think it's crazy.</i>

00:07:31.884 --> 00:07:34.353 line:95%,end
MELISSA: So what did you think
of our dance concert?

00:07:36.222 --> 00:07:38.124 line:95%,end
I mean, they're really,
really talented,

00:07:38.191 --> 00:07:39.592 line:95%,end
I mean, as far as
technique goes.

00:07:39.659 --> 00:07:41.260 line:95%,end
But as far as entertaining,

00:07:41.327 --> 00:07:43.296 line:95%,end
I don't think it was really entertaining.

00:07:43.362 --> 00:07:46.365 line:95%,end
-It didn't have a lot of personal--
-Really? (gasps)


00:07:46.432 --> 00:07:47.433 line:95%,end
The whole show?

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.735 line:95%,end
CHLOE: <i>So the new mom</i>
<i>comes upstairs,</i>

00:07:49.802 --> 00:07:53.706 line:5%,start
and she sits herself down,
and she seems a little opinionated,

00:07:53.773 --> 00:07:55.074 line:5%,start
to say the least.

00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:57.009 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I think our kids
are fabulous on stage.

00:07:57.076 --> 00:07:58.411 line:95%,end
-I mean, I have to--
-KAYA: I think they are too.

00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:00.179 line:95%,end
I wouldn't have brought her
here if I didn't think

00:08:00.246 --> 00:08:01.547 line:95%,end
you had fabulous dancers.

00:08:01.614 --> 00:08:04.116 line:95%,end
I just think that they could use
a little more personality,

00:08:04.183 --> 00:08:06.519 line:95%,end
a little more diva-tude,
and she has that.

00:08:06.586 --> 00:08:08.788 line:5%,start
Diva-tude is
just when you're born with it,

00:08:08.855 --> 00:08:10.089 line:95%,end
<i>when you just know you have it.</i>

00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:12.925 line:95%,end
<i>No amount of technique</i>
<i>or any type of training gives you that.</i>

00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:14.894 line:95%,end
I didn't think any
of Abby's dancers had that.

00:08:14.961 --> 00:08:17.463 line:95%,end
-Diva-tude?
-KAYA: Yeah, that's what I call it.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:18.865 line:95%,end
MELISSA:
What does your jacket say?

00:08:19.932 --> 00:08:21.367 line:95%,end
Black Patsy.

00:08:21.434 --> 00:08:22.768 line:95%,end
I love that name.
It's really pretty.

00:08:24.203 --> 00:08:25.805 line:95%,end
ABBY: You guys keep working.

00:08:25.872 --> 00:08:27.206 line:95%,end
Get that down pat.

00:08:27.273 --> 00:08:28.541 line:95%,end
Come on over here to the bar.

00:08:28.975 --> 00:08:31.477 line:95%,end
Let me see fifth position, tendu.

00:08:32.311 --> 00:08:34.247 line:95%,end
And let me see a ronde de jambe.

00:08:35.548 --> 00:08:39.752 line:95%,end
I asked Nicaya to execute
a few ballet steps.

00:08:39.819 --> 00:08:43.556 line:95%,end
<i>I want to see</i>
<i>if she has a foundation,</i>

00:08:43.623 --> 00:08:45.525 line:95%,end
if she knows her terminology.

00:08:46.425 --> 00:08:48.160 line:95%,end
And can you spell
ronde de jambe?

00:08:49.328 --> 00:08:51.898 line:95%,end
You have to know
the names of everything.

00:08:51.964 --> 00:08:53.866 line:95%,end
We're really
into terminology here.

00:08:53.933 --> 00:08:56.235 line:95%,end
MADDIE: <i>It's good that girls</i>
<i>want to tryout for our team.</i>

00:08:56.302 --> 00:08:59.605 line:5%,start
But I don't really want
any a new member right now

00:08:59.672 --> 00:09:02.775 line:5%,start
because I'm perfectly fine
with all my friends.

00:09:02.842 --> 00:09:04.744 line:95%,end
Do you do any acrobatics
or gymnastics?

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:05.912 line:95%,end
-NICAYA: No.
-ABBY: None?

00:09:05.978 --> 00:09:06.812 line:95%,end
None.

00:09:06.879 --> 00:09:08.681 line:95%,end
Now I'm beginning
to wonder about this girl.

00:09:08.748 --> 00:09:10.049 line:95%,end
<i>Is she for real?</i>

00:09:10.116 --> 00:09:11.651 line:95%,end
<i>Is she an advanced student</i>

00:09:11.717 --> 00:09:13.786 line:95%,end
or is she just a recreation student

00:09:13.853 --> 00:09:16.622 line:95%,end
that goes once a week
whose mother's trying to get her

00:09:16.689 --> 00:09:18.291 line:95%,end
onto a competition team?

00:09:18.357 --> 00:09:19.926 line:95%,end
Second, second.

00:09:19.992 --> 00:09:22.828 line:95%,end
She's gonna audition or...

00:09:22.895 --> 00:09:25.031 line:95%,end
KAYA: I think she should
just choreographing a routine

00:09:25.097 --> 00:09:26.165 line:95%,end
and just put her in it.

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:29.468 line:95%,end
Because her testing to see
how flexible she is, is not really...

00:09:29.535 --> 00:09:31.971 line:95%,end
There's a lot of other kids
who want to dance on this team,

00:09:32.038 --> 00:09:34.073 line:95%,end
so I don't know why
she would just get to walk in

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:35.775 line:95%,end
and be on it, when there's
other kids who have had

00:09:35.841 --> 00:09:37.243 line:95%,end
-to go through auditions.
-Other kids don't have

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:38.511 line:95%,end
a resume like hers.

00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:40.947 line:95%,end
So I'm gonna call
your mom down, okie doke?

00:09:41.013 --> 00:09:42.748 line:95%,end
Oh, Abby wants me
to come down.

00:09:42.815 --> 00:09:44.784 line:95%,end
-KELLY: Ha. Good luck!
-CHRISTI: Good luck.

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:46.819 line:95%,end
I ain't scared of her.

00:09:48.888 --> 00:09:51.557 line:95%,end
JILL: God, she's a loose can--
you never know what's coming

00:09:51.624 --> 00:09:52.692 line:95%,end
-out of her mouth...
-CHLOE: That's true.

00:09:52.758 --> 00:09:54.226 line:95%,end
-JILL: ...no matter how nice, how mean.
-Are you serious?

00:09:54.293 --> 00:09:55.528 line:95%,end
Your recital was boring

00:09:55.595 --> 00:09:59.565 line:95%,end
and all these kids
need help to perform.

00:09:59.632 --> 00:10:01.033 line:95%,end
You're not gonna work
on this team, girlfriend.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.235 line:95%,end
She knows zero terminology.

00:10:03.302 --> 00:10:05.338 line:95%,end
My kids are the whole package,

00:10:05.404 --> 00:10:08.174 line:95%,end
not just little bits and pieces.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.475 line:95%,end
When my kids leave here,

00:10:09.542 --> 00:10:12.511 line:95%,end
they have a career,
a livelihood, forever.

00:10:12.578 --> 00:10:14.880 line:95%,end
KAYA: <i>I don't think</i>
<i>that these spelling tests</i>

00:10:14.947 --> 00:10:17.083 line:95%,end
and all this other stupid dance
terminology is relevant.

00:10:17.149 --> 00:10:18.784 line:95%,end
What I personally
want Abby to do

00:10:18.851 --> 00:10:20.586 line:95%,end
is stick my daughter's
damn dance CD in there

00:10:20.653 --> 00:10:21.921 line:95%,end
and watch her dance.

00:10:21.988 --> 00:10:24.123 line:95%,end
You're the professional.
You've been doing this all this time.

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:27.026 line:95%,end
You create stars, so why would
I question what you're saying?

00:10:27.093 --> 00:10:28.995 line:95%,end
Yay!
Hallelujah!

00:10:29.061 --> 00:10:31.664 line:95%,end
-We have a winner. Yay!
-Don't just disguise her all the way.

00:10:31.731 --> 00:10:33.065 line:95%,end
ABBY: Can you
come back tomorrow?

00:10:33.132 --> 00:10:34.500 line:95%,end
-NICAYA: Yes.
-ABBY: So come back,

00:10:34.567 --> 00:10:35.835 line:95%,end
bring her in tomorrow.
I'll have more time.

00:10:35.901 --> 00:10:36.936 line:95%,end
JILL: I just heard her say.

00:10:37.003 --> 00:10:38.104 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I heard her say
come back tomorrow.

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:39.338 line:95%,end
But why?

00:10:39.405 --> 00:10:41.173 line:95%,end
You don't get to just come
and be on the team.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.376 line:95%,end
Our girls are two weeks
from nationals.

00:10:43.442 --> 00:10:45.511 line:95%,end
Why Abby would ever consider

00:10:45.578 --> 00:10:47.880 line:95%,end
adding a new girl to the team
right now is beyond me.

00:10:47.947 --> 00:10:51.150 line:95%,end
That does not make
any kind of sense whatsoever.

00:10:51.217 --> 00:10:52.618 line:95%,end
Just when I thought

00:10:52.685 --> 00:10:55.721 line:95%,end
it couldn't get any crazier,
it got crazier.

00:10:58.591 --> 00:11:01.927 line:95%,end
So she wanted to know
if you could spell ronde de jambe,

00:11:01.994 --> 00:11:03.963 line:95%,end
if you could spell
dance terminology.

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:07.199 line:95%,end
What the hell does that have
to do with dancing?

00:11:07.266 --> 00:11:08.834 line:95%,end
She goes, do ronde de jambe.

00:11:08.901 --> 00:11:10.569 line:95%,end
Now, can you spell
ronde de jambe?

00:11:10.636 --> 00:11:11.937 line:95%,end
I go, no.

00:11:12.004 --> 00:11:14.173 line:95%,end
That is (bleep),
and she knows that.

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.608 line:95%,end
She doesn't want
to give you a chance

00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:18.310 line:95%,end
because I meant what I said.
Her dancers have no personality.

00:11:18.978 --> 00:11:20.246 line:95%,end
What do you have on now?

00:11:20.312 --> 00:11:22.415 line:95%,end
A title jacket--so what
difference does it make?

00:11:22.481 --> 00:11:23.616 line:95%,end
We're gonna play her game.

00:11:23.683 --> 00:11:26.052 line:95%,end
We're gonna go home tonight,
we're gonna learn this terminology.

00:11:26.118 --> 00:11:28.721 line:95%,end
She's gonna learn how to spell
all these stupid ass dance terms,

00:11:28.788 --> 00:11:30.056 line:95%,end
and we're gonna come back tomorrow

00:11:30.122 --> 00:11:31.791 line:95%,end
and play the game
Abby wants to play.

-KELLY: Hi.

00:13:03.082 --> 00:13:04.049 line:95%,end
KAYA: Excuse me.

00:13:04.116 --> 00:13:05.117 line:95%,end
KELLY: Mm-hmm.

HOLLY: <i>When Kaya arrives,</i>

00:13:08.754 --> 00:13:10.456 line:5%,start
there's a tension that's evident

00:13:10.523 --> 00:13:12.625 line:5%,start
from the moment she steps foot
into the room.

00:13:13.993 --> 00:13:15.728 line:95%,end
What do you want
the girls to call you?

00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:17.429 line:95%,end
My nickname is Nini.

00:13:17.496 --> 00:13:18.998 line:95%,end
JILL: Oh, they call you Nini?

00:13:19.064 --> 00:13:20.666 line:95%,end
-KAYA: Mm-hmm.
-MADDIE: I'll call you Laquifa now.

00:13:20.733 --> 00:13:22.902 line:95%,end
(laughter)

00:13:22.968 --> 00:13:25.671 line:95%,end
GIRLS: (singing)<i> âª Laquifa, ooh âª</i>

00:13:25.738 --> 00:13:27.373 line:95%,end
HOLLY: <i>We don't know Kaya,</i>

00:13:27.439 --> 00:13:30.576 line:95%,end
and we're trying to figure out
who Kaya is.

00:13:30.643 --> 00:13:33.012 line:95%,end
Come on, girls.
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

00:13:33.078 --> 00:13:35.981 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:13:38.551 --> 00:13:41.387 line:5%,start
Five, six, seven, go.

00:13:41.453 --> 00:13:44.890 line:5%,start
Five, six, seven, eight.

00:13:44.957 --> 00:13:47.326 line:95%,end
God, I hope Paige
gets cleared today.

00:13:48.027 --> 00:13:50.896 line:95%,end
Because I think
it's going to take her a week or so

00:13:50.963 --> 00:13:54.099 line:95%,end
to get used
to just walking on her foot.

00:13:54.166 --> 00:13:55.601 line:95%,end
<i>I think Paige is nervous.</i>

00:13:55.668 --> 00:13:58.404 line:5%,start
I think she's afraid
that the doctor's gonna tell her,

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:01.473 line:5%,start
you know, we need to wait
another two weeks just to be sure.

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:04.877 line:95%,end
Go, two, three, four, drop.

00:14:04.944 --> 00:14:06.912 line:95%,end
So where are you
going for nationals?

00:14:06.979 --> 00:14:08.414 line:95%,end
-We don't know.
-Well, she hasn't told us.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.015 line:95%,end
How do you have
a life outside of dance

00:14:10.082 --> 00:14:12.751 line:95%,end
if you have no idea
what you're doing in four days?

00:14:12.818 --> 00:14:14.453 line:95%,end
-This is our life.
-We devote it to these kids.

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.856 line:95%,end
You devote your time here.
This is your life.

00:14:16.922 --> 00:14:18.190 line:95%,end
Do any of you work?

00:14:18.257 --> 00:14:19.325 line:95%,end
-No.
-I used to work.

00:14:19.391 --> 00:14:21.126 line:95%,end
I owned a business.
I had to sell it.

00:14:21.193 --> 00:14:23.329 line:95%,end
-What do you have nannies at home?
-CHRISTI: No.

00:14:23.395 --> 00:14:24.597 line:95%,end
Just really good
husbands who pick up--

00:14:24.663 --> 00:14:26.899 line:95%,end
-Exactly.
-JILL: So you're a single mom?

00:14:26.966 --> 00:14:28.834 line:95%,end
-JILL: Yes, I am.
-With four kids?

00:14:28.901 --> 00:14:30.736 line:95%,end
-Yep.
-Wow.

00:14:30.803 --> 00:14:32.771 line:95%,end
-It's a team effort.
-Yeah, well, our relationship ended

00:14:32.838 --> 00:14:35.741 line:95%,end
-because of dance.
-Oh, really? Lovely.

00:14:35.808 --> 00:14:37.943 line:95%,end
Your husband
didn't support dance?

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:39.745 line:95%,end
I didn't have a husband.
I had a wife.

00:14:43.349 --> 00:14:44.283 line:95%,end
<i>Hmm.</i>

00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:47.820 line:5%,start
It's like you could hear
a pin drop in the room,

00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:49.355 line:5%,start
like they had never,
ever heard of anybody

00:14:49.421 --> 00:14:50.756 line:5%,start
being a lesbian before.


00:14:50.823 --> 00:14:52.458 line:95%,end
So what would you like us
to call you?

00:14:52.524 --> 00:14:54.159 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Because we've been
calling you Patsy.

00:14:54.226 --> 00:14:55.461 line:95%,end
-KAYA: Really?
-Yes.

00:14:55.527 --> 00:14:57.229 line:95%,end
Well, you call yourself Patsy.

00:14:57.296 --> 00:14:58.931 line:95%,end
-The Black Pasty.
-CHRISTI: I know.

00:14:58.998 --> 00:15:01.700 line:95%,end
-We were calling you Black Patsy.
-I want to know what that means.

00:15:01.767 --> 00:15:03.769 line:95%,end
-You know who Patsy Ramsey is?
-Yeah.

00:15:03.836 --> 00:15:05.738 line:95%,end
-KAYA: The crazy stage mom.
-KELLY: That's you.

00:15:05.804 --> 00:15:08.274 line:95%,end
KAYA: All dance moms
have an inner Patsy.

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:09.808 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>Are you really proud of that,</i>

00:15:09.875 --> 00:15:11.110 line:95%,end
that that's your nickname.

00:15:11.176 --> 00:15:12.745 line:95%,end
Because like, I certainly

00:15:12.811 --> 00:15:14.847 line:95%,end
wouldn't want to be compared
to Patsy Ramsey.

00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:16.849 line:95%,end
(laughter)

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:20.819 line:95%,end
ABBY: Five, six, seven, eight, one.

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:22.821 line:95%,end
-KELLY: Abby?
-ABBY: Yes.

00:15:22.888 --> 00:15:23.856 line:95%,end
Excuse me.
Can I get Paige?

00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:25.124 line:95%,end
It's time
for her doctor's appointment.

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:27.059 line:95%,end
Go ahead, go.
Good luck.

00:15:28.327 --> 00:15:29.695 line:95%,end
See ya.

00:15:29.762 --> 00:15:32.765 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:15:34.133 --> 00:15:35.301 line:5%,start
SINGER: <i>âª It was gonna be... âª</i>

00:15:35.367 --> 00:15:36.335 line:5%,start
ABBY: Stretch your feet.

00:15:36.402 --> 00:15:37.870 line:5%,start
Feet.

00:15:37.937 --> 00:15:39.805 line:95%,end
Sloppy feet.

00:15:40.806 --> 00:15:42.107 line:95%,end
The arms in second.

00:15:42.174 --> 00:15:44.944 line:5%,start
Chloe's solo, it's called
"Glitz and glamour."

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:48.280 line:95%,end
I needed something
to represent new Hollywood,

00:15:48.347 --> 00:15:50.749 line:95%,end
the piercings, the tattoos,

00:15:50.816 --> 00:15:53.285 line:95%,end
<i>somebody that would stab</i>
<i>your eyeballs out</i>

00:15:53.352 --> 00:15:55.955 line:95%,end
and step right over you to get ahead.

00:15:56.021 --> 00:15:57.356 line:95%,end
That's Chloe.

00:15:57.423 --> 00:15:58.757 line:95%,end
This is the road to nationals.

00:15:59.491 --> 00:16:01.327 line:95%,end
We're going to iHollywood.

00:16:01.393 --> 00:16:03.262 line:95%,end
All those kids on the West Coast
are gonna be there.

00:16:03.329 --> 00:16:05.798 line:95%,end
You have the target
on your back.

00:16:05.864 --> 00:16:08.867 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:16:12.071 --> 00:16:15.174 line:95%,end
I don't want to hear
your feet hit the ground.

00:16:16.175 --> 00:16:17.176 line:95%,end
Play.

00:16:19.511 --> 00:16:20.879 line:95%,end
What did the doctor said?

00:16:20.946 --> 00:16:23.182 line:95%,end
KELLY: She got cleared.
She's allowed to dance.

00:16:23.248 --> 00:16:24.550 line:95%,end
Yay!

00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:27.853 line:95%,end
But she's not allowed
to do tricks for two more weeks.

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.054 line:95%,end
Okay.

00:16:29.121 --> 00:16:30.990 line:95%,end
KELLY: He said to do
a very limited,

00:16:31.056 --> 00:16:33.826 line:95%,end
you know, not to overwork it.

00:16:33.892 --> 00:16:34.994 line:95%,end
-Okay.
-KELLY: So...

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:36.762 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>Paige can be</i>
<i>in the number.</i>

00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:38.897 line:95%,end
But is she gonna be full out?

00:16:38.964 --> 00:16:40.499 line:95%,end
I don't know.

00:16:40.566 --> 00:16:41.734 line:95%,end
And I want to win.

00:16:46.238 --> 00:16:47.206 line:95%,end
-Hi.
-KAYA: Hello.

00:16:47.272 --> 00:16:49.808 line:95%,end
ABBY: I want to get you
to fill this paperwork out.

00:16:49.875 --> 00:16:51.343 line:95%,end
-Okay.
-Okay?

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:53.078 line:95%,end
So I was thinking,

00:16:53.145 --> 00:16:55.481 line:95%,end
well, maybe she could jump in
and take Paige's spot.

00:16:55.547 --> 00:16:57.850 line:95%,end
But now Paige came back
from the doctor today and said,

00:16:57.916 --> 00:17:00.352 line:95%,end
hey, I'm allowed to dance.

00:17:00.419 --> 00:17:03.188 line:95%,end
(exhales) But she's already
been there.

00:17:03.255 --> 00:17:04.757 line:95%,end
She's learned all of the routine.

00:17:04.823 --> 00:17:06.325 line:95%,end
I mean, you're taking
a chance on Paige

00:17:06.392 --> 00:17:09.028 line:95%,end
because she just got over
an injury, so it's kind of iffy.

00:17:09.094 --> 00:17:10.329 line:95%,end
No, I'm taking
a chance on Paige

00:17:10.396 --> 00:17:12.231 line:95%,end
because she's been here
since she's three years of.

00:17:12.297 --> 00:17:13.899 line:95%,end
KAYA: <i>Paige has</i>
<i>a boot on her foot.</i>

00:17:13.966 --> 00:17:15.667 line:95%,end
Even once the boot
comes off her foot,

00:17:15.734 --> 00:17:18.003 line:95%,end
she won't be able to dance up
to par with the rest of the team

00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:19.905 line:95%,end
because she's not really
picking up the choreography.

00:17:19.972 --> 00:17:21.273 line:95%,end
And Kaya already knows it.

00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:22.841 line:95%,end
There's no reason
that she shouldn't replace her

00:17:22.908 --> 00:17:23.909 line:95%,end
just for this number.

00:17:23.976 --> 00:17:25.611 line:95%,end
Give her a chance.
Let her compete with you guys.

00:17:25.677 --> 00:17:26.545 line:95%,end
Let her on the team.

00:17:26.612 --> 00:17:27.913 line:95%,end
Usually, when you walk
into the studio,

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:30.616 line:95%,end
you have to be here for a year
before you even audition.

00:17:30.682 --> 00:17:32.584 line:95%,end
But what would it take for me
to show you

00:17:32.651 --> 00:17:34.686 line:95%,end
how bad I want her on this team

00:17:34.753 --> 00:17:36.121 line:95%,end
and how bad
she wants to be on the team?

00:17:36.188 --> 00:17:38.257 line:95%,end
If I don't put her in this number

00:17:38.323 --> 00:17:41.360 line:95%,end
and she's just a swing,
are you still gonna go?

00:17:41.427 --> 00:17:42.594 line:95%,end
Yes, we will.

00:17:44.063 --> 00:17:46.131 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>Kaya is standing</i>
<i>right in front of me,</i>

00:17:46.198 --> 00:17:48.300 line:95%,end
telling me she'll do
whatever it takes to get her daughter

00:17:48.367 --> 00:17:50.102 line:95%,end
<i>on this competition team.</i>

00:17:50.169 --> 00:17:51.904 line:95%,end
Well, hey,
we're going to California.

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:53.539 line:95%,end
<i>I might just invite</i>
<i>the kid to go.</i>

00:17:54.406 --> 00:17:56.842 line:95%,end
All right, you better know it.
You might get put on the spot.

00:17:56.909 --> 00:17:58.510 line:95%,end
-Okay.
-ABBY: All right, goodnight.

00:17:58.577 --> 00:18:00.279 line:95%,end
-KAYA: Okay, thank you.
-NICAYA: Thank you.

CHRISTI: <i>Patsy invites</i>
<i>all the moms to lunch,</i>

because, well, she wants
to get to know us better.

00:18:09.721 --> 00:18:11.690 line:5%,start
And frankly, I'd like
to get to know her better.

00:18:11.757 --> 00:18:13.392 line:95%,end
You had a boyfriend
and you moved out?

00:18:13.459 --> 00:18:14.760 line:95%,end
-Oh, a girlfriend.
-Yes.

MELISSA: Oh.

00:18:20.632 --> 00:18:22.334 line:5%,start
She was a little too friendly to me.

Sorry, I'm just curious.

00:18:24.069 --> 00:18:26.138 line:95%,end
Okay, so what do you guys
think about me so far?

00:18:26.205 --> 00:18:30.008 line:95%,end
KELLY: Well, with your AKA
of being Black Patsy,

00:18:30.075 --> 00:18:31.877 line:95%,end
like, you're crazy.

00:18:31.944 --> 00:18:34.346 line:95%,end
-Why would that make me crazy?
-KELLY: Crazy dance mom.

00:18:34.413 --> 00:18:36.415 line:95%,end
All of you
are crazy dance moms.

00:18:36.482 --> 00:18:37.783 line:95%,end
I'm not that crazy.

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:39.485 line:95%,end
So since you're kind
of in my position

00:18:39.551 --> 00:18:42.621 line:95%,end
trying to get your child on the team,
what does that take?

00:18:42.688 --> 00:18:43.689 line:5%,start
Are you crazy?

00:18:43.755 --> 00:18:46.058 line:5%,start
You think I'm gonna tell you
how to get your daughter on the team

00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:48.327 line:5%,start
when I can't even get
my own daughter on the team?

00:18:48.393 --> 00:18:51.063 line:95%,end
You just waltzed in
and threw your kid in the room.

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:52.931 line:95%,end
And you don't just get to walk in
and be on a competition team.

00:18:52.998 --> 00:18:53.866 line:95%,end
MELISSA: You should see our contract.

00:18:53.932 --> 00:18:55.701 line:95%,end
So far I have just walked in.

00:18:55.767 --> 00:18:58.137 line:95%,end

00:18:59.338 --> 00:19:01.740 line:95%,end
It just is very unnerving

oh, my daughter's just as good.

00:19:03.876 --> 00:19:05.511 line:95%,end
Are you coming to LA with us?

00:19:05.577 --> 00:19:07.746 line:95%,end

HOLLY: <i>It's a bizarre situation.</i>

00:19:09.248 --> 00:19:10.782 line:5%,start
This is a bizarre lunch.

00:19:10.849 --> 00:19:12.718 line:95%,end
<i>We're not in a very good place.</i>

00:19:12.784 --> 00:19:13.886 line:95%,end
Who are you?

00:19:13.952 --> 00:19:16.555 line:95%,end
All we know is that it says
Black Patsy on a jacket

00:19:16.622 --> 00:19:18.157 line:95%,end
and you're Nicaya's mom.

00:19:18.223 --> 00:19:19.725 line:95%,end
KAYA: <i>The moms can say</i>
<i>whatever the hell they want to say</i>

00:19:19.791 --> 00:19:21.226 line:95%,end
about me.
I'm not here for them.

00:19:21.293 --> 00:19:22.227 line:95%,end
I'm here for my daughter.

00:19:22.294 --> 00:19:23.595 line:95%,end
I don't have any feelings
towards them.

00:19:23.662 --> 00:19:25.063 line:95%,end
I don't give a damn
what they feel about me.

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:26.365 line:95%,end
It's all about Nicaya.

00:19:28.667 --> 00:19:30.869 line:5%,start
ABBY: <i>Solos this week are vital.</i>

00:19:30.936 --> 00:19:34.540 line:5%,start
I want to see who is strong enough
mentally and physically

00:19:34.606 --> 00:19:36.275 line:5%,start
to win at nationals.

00:19:37.042 --> 00:19:38.410 line:5%,start
Stomach, use your stomach.

00:19:38.477 --> 00:19:39.378 line:5%,start
Up.

00:19:40.646 --> 00:19:42.247 line:95%,end
That knee was so bent.

00:19:42.314 --> 00:19:43.849 line:95%,end
Arabesque,
straighten that knee, Nia.

00:19:43.916 --> 00:19:44.783 line:95%,end
Come on.

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:47.786 line:95%,end
<i>Nia's solo this week,</i>
<i>it's a '20s scat,</i>

00:19:47.853 --> 00:19:50.155 line:95%,end
<i>inspired by Josephine Baker.</i>

00:19:50.222 --> 00:19:51.657 line:95%,end
There's no vocals,

00:19:51.723 --> 00:19:54.793 line:95%,end
<i>so her timing must be impeccable.</i>

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.962 line:95%,end
This is a big challenge for Nia.

00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:58.463 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Josephine Baker
could shake.

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:00.799 line:95%,end
She was like
the BeyoncÃ© of the time.

00:20:00.866 --> 00:20:03.468 line:95%,end
Oh, my God, and Nia's
the new BeyoncÃ© upcoming.

00:20:03.535 --> 00:20:06.572 line:95%,end
-HOLLY: Oh, yeah. (laughs)
-CHRISTI: That's Nia fierce.

00:20:06.638 --> 00:20:07.606 line:95%,end
Left and around.

00:20:07.673 --> 00:20:10.976 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Oh, my eyes, my eyes!

00:20:11.043 --> 00:20:14.346 line:95%,end
You know, there's something
when you see Abby get up and gyrate.

00:20:14.413 --> 00:20:15.247 line:95%,end
It's...

00:20:16.081 --> 00:20:18.083 line:95%,end
It's not a pretty sight.

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:19.718 line:95%,end
First she wanted Holly
to paddle her.

00:20:19.785 --> 00:20:21.853 line:95%,end
-Now she's shaking it in our faces.
-I know.

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:26.625 line:95%,end
SINGER: <i>âª One more boring</i>

00:20:26.692 --> 00:20:28.627 line:95%,end
<i>âª It's like I'm stuck here in a maze now âª</i>

00:20:28.694 --> 00:20:32.764 line:5%,start
One and a two, three and a four,
five and a six, seven, eight.

00:20:32.831 --> 00:20:34.533 line:95%,end
Kenzie will be doing
a solo this week.

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.134 line:95%,end
It's entitled "Hollywood."

00:20:36.201 --> 00:20:38.937 line:95%,end
<i>She really needs</i>
<i>to stay on the music.</i>

00:20:39.004 --> 00:20:40.305 line:95%,end
That's what
we're working on this week.

00:20:41.406 --> 00:20:43.408 line:95%,end
You tell me
what this dance is about.

00:20:43.475 --> 00:20:46.912 line:95%,end
The Walk of Fame on...

00:20:46.979 --> 00:20:47.879 line:95%,end
in Hollywood.

00:20:47.946 --> 00:20:48.981 line:95%,end
ABBY: Yes, all right.

00:20:49.047 --> 00:20:50.649 line:5%,start
I love my solo this week

00:20:50.716 --> 00:20:54.219 line:5%,start
because my solo's called "Hollywood,"
and I love Hollywood.

00:20:56.755 --> 00:20:58.223 line:95%,end
Spread apart.

00:20:58.290 --> 00:20:59.358 line:95%,end
Let's go.

00:20:59.424 --> 00:21:02.561 line:95%,end
This piece is very important
to the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:21:02.628 --> 00:21:03.595 line:95%,end
<i>I'm excited about it.</i>

00:21:03.662 --> 00:21:05.097 line:5%,start
<i>I love it.</i>

00:21:05.163 --> 00:21:06.298 line:95%,end
I think this could be a winner.

00:21:06.365 --> 00:21:08.066 line:95%,end
You move out of there
for right now.

00:21:09.167 --> 00:21:10.969 line:95%,end
All right, let's go.
Get on the line.

00:21:12.471 --> 00:21:14.773 line:95%,end
SINGER: <i>âª My kite was as high âª</i>

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.908 line:95%,end
<i>âª As the rope would let it go âª</i>

00:21:16.975 --> 00:21:19.311 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>Nicaya's been there</i>
<i>every minute.</i>

00:21:19.378 --> 00:21:21.647 line:95%,end
<i>So I want to see</i>
<i>what the group looks like.</i>

00:21:21.713 --> 00:21:24.716 line:95%,end
Nicaya, stand in Paige's spot.

00:21:24.783 --> 00:21:25.751 line:95%,end
That's it.

00:21:29.221 --> 00:21:32.057 line:95%,end
All right, let me see
you out, you in.

00:21:32.124 --> 00:21:33.125 line:95%,end
Go.

00:21:33.425 --> 00:21:37.529 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>I'm watching rehearsal,</i>
<i>and it's like Abby's playing game.</i>

00:21:37.596 --> 00:21:39.164 line:95%,end
<i>Paige will do the dance one time,</i>

00:21:39.231 --> 00:21:41.466 line:95%,end
<i>and then Nicaya does it</i>
<i>the next time.</i>

00:21:41.533 --> 00:21:44.770 line:5%,start
Please tell me
who is on the team here.


00:21:47.272 --> 00:21:48.640 line:95%,end
That's her turning foot
that's hurt.

00:21:48.707 --> 00:21:49.541 line:95%,end
Oh.

00:21:51.576 --> 00:21:54.179 line:95%,end
It's her left foot. Look, it
doesn't point like the right foot.

00:21:54.246 --> 00:21:57.716 line:95%,end
All right, you're both boring,
boring, boring.

00:21:57.783 --> 00:21:59.885 line:95%,end
PAIGE: <i>My foot's really</i>
<i>bothering me in rehearsal,</i>

00:21:59.951 --> 00:22:02.521 line:5%,start
so I just hope Miss Abby
let's me take it easy.

00:22:02.587 --> 00:22:04.156 line:95%,end
KELLY: Hey, peanut.
How's your foot?

00:22:04.222 --> 00:22:05.791 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:22:05.857 --> 00:22:07.726 line:95%,end
-MELISSA: Is your foot okay?
-What's the matter?

00:22:07.793 --> 00:22:10.962 line:95%,end
It kinda hurts whenever I like,
step on it and do the kick.

00:22:11.029 --> 00:22:14.933 line:95%,end
You need to say, Miss Abby,
it hurts when I step on it and fan kick.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.536 line:95%,end
Can I just mark that
until I'm on stage?

00:22:17.602 --> 00:22:19.004 line:95%,end
She will say yes.

00:22:19.071 --> 00:22:22.607 line:95%,end
This is your first day
of not having a cast on your foot.

00:22:22.674 --> 00:22:25.777 line:95%,end
<i>Paige has waited for four weeks</i>

00:22:25.844 --> 00:22:27.112 line:95%,end
to get this boot off of her foot.

00:22:27.179 --> 00:22:30.549 line:95%,end
And Abby keeps pulling her
to put someone else in the dance.

00:22:30.615 --> 00:22:33.085 line:95%,end
ABBY: All right, ladies,
I want you all to know that Paige

00:22:33.151 --> 00:22:34.353 line:95%,end
just came to me and said,

00:22:34.419 --> 00:22:35.921 line:95%,end
can she mark the pancake

00:22:35.987 --> 00:22:37.656 line:95%,end
because it hurts
her supporting foot.

00:22:37.723 --> 00:22:40.192 line:95%,end
I'm just letting Paige
sit out during rehearsal

00:22:40.258 --> 00:22:41.760 line:95%,end
because her foot
still bothering her.

00:22:41.827 --> 00:22:43.562 line:95%,end
<i>I'm not replacing her.</i>

00:22:43.628 --> 00:22:47.132 line:95%,end
But if that foot still hurts
come competition time, I will.

00:22:47.199 --> 00:22:48.400 line:95%,end
The show must go on.

00:22:48.467 --> 00:22:51.737 line:95%,end
And it's gonna happen,
no matter who's out there dancing.

00:22:51.803 --> 00:22:54.906 line:95%,end
If she's injured,
she shouldn't be on stage.

00:22:54.973 --> 00:22:56.274 line:95%,end
She should save it
till she's ready.

00:22:56.341 --> 00:22:58.610 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>One part of me</i>
<i>wants to go down there</i>

00:22:58.677 --> 00:23:00.011 line:95%,end
<i>and just knock somebody out.</i>

00:23:00.078 --> 00:23:01.613 line:95%,end
<i>So I excused myself.</i>

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:02.748 line:95%,end
I'm done!

00:23:02.814 --> 00:23:03.915 line:95%,end
(door slams)

00:23:03.982 --> 00:23:06.718 line:95%,end
KELLY: (bleep) my kid!

00:23:06.785 --> 00:23:09.187 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>Once again,</i>
<i>Kelly overreacts</i>

00:23:09.254 --> 00:23:10.288 line:95%,end
and throws a hissy fit.

00:23:10.355 --> 00:23:11.757 line:95%,end
<i>Well, you know what, Kelly?</i>

00:23:11.823 --> 00:23:13.558 line:95%,end
The reason I keep
bringing new moms

00:23:13.625 --> 00:23:16.361 line:95%,end
and new kids into the studio
is because of behavior like yours.

00:23:16.428 --> 00:23:17.662 line:95%,end
<i>I'm sick of it.</i>

00:23:17.729 --> 00:23:19.631 line:95%,end
Kaya, if you weren't here
and Nicaya wasn't here,

00:23:19.698 --> 00:23:21.233 line:95%,end
this whole issue
would not exist.

00:23:21.299 --> 00:23:22.868 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I think where it started...

00:23:22.934 --> 00:23:24.069 line:95%,end
-Of course it does.
-...was that Abby was choosing

00:23:24.136 --> 00:23:25.670 line:95%,end
between Nicaya and Paige.

00:23:25.737 --> 00:23:26.738 line:95%,end
Her mom was sitting there saying

00:23:26.805 --> 00:23:28.974 line:95%,end
she don't think she's ready
to go out there and dance yet.

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:30.675 line:95%,end
Paige is still hurt.

00:23:30.742 --> 00:23:33.578 line:95%,end
She was cleared by the doctor.
Are you a medical doctor?

00:23:33.645 --> 00:23:35.447 line:95%,end
KAYA: What the hell
is the problem if one more kid is added.

00:23:35.514 --> 00:23:38.049 line:95%,end
You got the wrong mama this time
'cause I don't back down to nobody.

00:23:38.116 --> 00:23:40.619 line:95%,end
-You don't scared me.
-Well, maybe you found the wrong mama.

00:23:41.553 --> 00:23:43.054 line:95%,end
I ain't found
the wrong (bleep).

00:23:43.121 --> 00:23:44.456 line:95%,end
None of--y'all don't move me.

00:23:44.523 --> 00:23:45.891 line:95%,end
But the point is, is that

00:23:45.957 --> 00:23:47.993 line:95%,end
Paige is either gonna dance
or Nini's gonna dance.

00:23:48.059 --> 00:23:49.161 line:95%,end
-She said she needed to rest it.
-KAYA: Okay,

00:23:49.227 --> 00:23:51.062 line:95%,end
I'm not gonna give y'all the--
if Abby says

00:23:51.129 --> 00:23:52.264 line:95%,end
she's gonna do this number,

00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:53.698 line:95%,end
we're gonna be
in LA doing a number.

00:23:53.765 --> 00:23:55.066 line:95%,end
And I don't have
to answer to any of y'all.

00:23:55.133 --> 00:23:56.168 line:95%,end
I don't care.

00:23:56.234 --> 00:23:58.570 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>Kelly storming</i>
<i>out of the studio</i>

00:23:58.637 --> 00:24:01.106 line:95%,end
and the moms upstairs
screaming at each other,

00:24:01.173 --> 00:24:03.208 line:95%,end
I decided something
needed to be done.

00:24:03.275 --> 00:24:06.178 line:95%,end
So I called them all downstairs
to straighten this mess out.

00:24:06.244 --> 00:24:07.813 line:95%,end
I'm sorry.
I think it's ridiculous.

00:24:07.879 --> 00:24:09.414 line:95%,end
JILL: No, I think
it's ridiculous too.

00:24:09.481 --> 00:24:11.216 line:95%,end
ABBY: I have a kid
that I don't even know

00:24:11.283 --> 00:24:12.984 line:95%,end
that's from another studio
that moved here.

00:24:13.652 --> 00:24:15.086 line:95%,end
I have a kid that's hurt.

00:24:15.153 --> 00:24:17.789 line:95%,end
I'm liable ladies.
This is a business.

00:24:17.856 --> 00:24:20.025 line:95%,end
I want Nicaya to take out
Brokeback Brooke

00:24:20.091 --> 00:24:22.327 line:95%,end
and Peg Leg Paige
just to shut Kelly up

00:24:22.394 --> 00:24:23.895 line:95%,end
because she talks so much (bleep).

00:24:23.962 --> 00:24:25.697 line:95%,end
I just want to prove to her
that her daughters

00:24:25.764 --> 00:24:27.299 line:95%,end
are not all that she thinks they are.

00:24:27.365 --> 00:24:29.668 line:95%,end
She's upset because she said
nobody's dancing,

00:24:29.734 --> 00:24:31.470 line:95%,end
the routine looks stupid,
and her daughter

00:24:31.536 --> 00:24:33.271 line:95%,end
-is always in the back burner.
-No.

00:24:33.338 --> 00:24:35.841 line:95%,end
But I don't like them blaming
and saying because Nicaya walked in--

00:24:35.907 --> 00:24:39.010 line:95%,end
Between Paige and a student
that isn't even your student,

00:24:39.077 --> 00:24:40.545 line:95%,end
-that's what her problem was.
-She's not choosing anything.

00:24:40.612 --> 00:24:43.148 line:95%,end
But it's up to Abby's discretion,
not yours.

00:24:43.215 --> 00:24:45.116 line:95%,end
All y'all are full of crap,
so I don't care.

00:24:45.183 --> 00:24:48.053 line:95%,end
JILL: I'm not doing this.
You can have one another.

00:24:48.119 --> 00:24:49.621 line:95%,end
-KAYA: 'Cause you're (bleep).
-I'm not doing this.

00:24:49.688 --> 00:24:50.655 line:95%,end
KAYA: You are.

00:24:50.722 --> 00:24:52.891 line:95%,end
We don't know
what's going on with the number.

00:24:52.958 --> 00:24:54.226 line:95%,end
This is chaos.

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:58.597 line:95%,end
So considering the behavior
of these mothers,

00:24:58.663 --> 00:25:00.565 line:95%,end
you told me that you were
ready to go to California,

00:25:00.632 --> 00:25:01.967 line:95%,end
I think you should go.

00:25:02.033 --> 00:25:05.070 line:95%,end
I am not making you a promise
that your daughter is in this.

00:25:05.136 --> 00:25:08.373 line:95%,end
So don't get there
and start acting like that.

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:10.141 line:95%,end
All right. Take care.

Well, Nicaya got it in 24 hours.

00:32:28.479 --> 00:32:30.915 line:95%,end
Have you asked her, like,

recently what she's thinking?

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:33.551 line:95%,end
Ask her.

Just say, I don't want my feelings

Whoever is not keeping up is out.

00:33:12.056 --> 00:33:13.558 line:95%,end

00:39:20.825 --> 00:39:23.194 line:95%,end
You're threatening
to replace her with somebody else.

00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:24.795 line:95%,end
-Why y'all keep saying replace?
-Why does she need to do that?

00:39:24.862 --> 00:39:26.797 line:95%,end
We're not coming to replace nobody.

00:39:26.864 --> 00:39:28.699 line:95%,end
-She just wants to be part of the team.
-I'm not talking to you. Thank you.

00:39:28.766 --> 00:39:30.134 line:95%,end
But when you refer to me or my child,

00:39:30.201 --> 00:39:31.736 line:95%,end
-then it puts me in the conversation.
-KELLY: I'm not talking to you.

00:39:31.802 --> 00:39:32.937 line:95%,end
What did you say, Abby. I'm sorry.

00:39:33.003 --> 00:39:34.071 line:95%,end
-Somebody is talking.
-KAYA: (indistinct)

00:39:34.138 --> 00:39:35.339 line:95%,end
Kaya was talking.

00:39:35.406 --> 00:39:36.540 line:95%,end
I don't want to even use your name.

00:39:36.607 --> 00:39:38.109 line:95%,end
That's why I keep saying her.

00:39:38.175 --> 00:39:40.344 line:95%,end
I got a name I want
to call you, too, not your own,

00:39:40.411 --> 00:39:42.179 line:95%,end
but I'm trying to be respectful.

00:39:42.613 --> 00:39:46.083 line:95%,end
You just jumped down on me
like I'm trying to invade this team

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:47.084 line:95%,end
and do something.

00:39:47.151 --> 00:39:48.686 line:95%,end
And it's no different
from what all of you are doing.

00:39:48.753 --> 00:39:50.955 line:95%,end
As a sister, I would think
you would respect that,

00:39:51.021 --> 00:39:53.491 line:95%,end
because there ain't a lot of chances
for Black women out here nowadays.

00:39:53.557 --> 00:39:55.259 line:95%,end
I would think that you would have my back.

00:39:55.326 --> 00:39:58.095 line:95%,end
Do not--do not take my ethnicity

00:39:58.162 --> 00:40:00.398 line:95%,end
and make me a poster child for whatever.

00:40:00.464 --> 00:40:03.868 line:95%,end
I choose to speak when I,
Holly Hatcher-Frazier,

00:40:03.934 --> 00:40:07.304 line:95%,end
Dr. Holly to everyone in this room,
has something to say.

00:40:07.371 --> 00:40:09.340 line:95%,end
KAYA: I don't know
how you work with these parents.

00:40:09.407 --> 00:40:12.610 line:95%,end
You called every one of us liars, haters.

00:40:12.676 --> 00:40:14.378 line:95%,end
Hater--yeah,
you are some--you're some haters.

00:40:14.445 --> 00:40:16.313 line:95%,end
-That's a name.
-I call it like I see it.

00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:19.517 line:95%,end
It's the truth, y'all.
Or liars, you're liars, especially you.

00:40:19.583 --> 00:40:20.851 line:95%,end
Oh, yeah, okay.

00:40:20.918 --> 00:40:22.319 line:95%,end
KAYA: You are phony as hell.

00:40:22.386 --> 00:40:23.220 line:95%,end
So are you.

00:40:23.287 --> 00:40:25.222 line:95%,end
-I'm not--you know what?
-KAYA: From what I see,

00:40:25.289 --> 00:40:26.223 line:95%,end
-you're fake.
-CHRISTI: I'm not phony at all.

00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:28.692 line:95%,end
Who I am is exactly who I come across as.

00:40:28.759 --> 00:40:30.361 line:95%,end
Yeah, a bitch, that's what you are.

00:40:30.428 --> 00:40:31.462 line:5%,start
And I know you own it.

00:40:33.297 --> 00:40:36.834 line:5%,start
You don't know a thing, bitch.

00:40:36.901 --> 00:40:38.002 line:5%,start
I be that bitch.

00:40:38.068 --> 00:40:39.036 line:5%,start
-I own it.
-CHRISTI: Don't let the door hit

00:40:39.103 --> 00:40:40.404 line:5%,start
your (bleep) out then.

00:40:40.471 --> 00:40:42.807 line:5%,start
You wanna watch your mouth because
I ain't the rest of these dance mamas.

00:40:42.873 --> 00:40:44.775 line:5%,start
I'm not a doctor like Holly do.
I'm from the hood.

00:40:46.177 --> 00:40:47.311 line:5%,start
Believe that.

00:40:47.378 --> 00:40:49.380 line:5%,start
JILL: Abby, are you gonna let this happen?

00:40:49.447 --> 00:40:50.281 line:5%,start
-I can't--
-KAYA: You're bitter!

00:40:50.347 --> 00:40:52.016 line:5%,start
-I don't use foul language.
-You're darn right we're bitter.

00:40:52.082 --> 00:40:54.251 line:5%,start
KAYA: I don't know
how you work with these parents.

00:40:54.318 --> 00:40:57.455 line:5%,start
(tense music playing)
