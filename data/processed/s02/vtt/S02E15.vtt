<i>Previously on </i>Dance Moms...

00:00:02.802 --> 00:00:05.271 line:5%,start
We never discussed you
forgetting your dance

00:00:05.338 --> 00:00:06.373 line:5%,start
and running off the stage.

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:09.376 line:5%,start
When you least expect it,
I'm going to throw you out there to do it.

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:12.045 line:5%,start
You are representing my entire career.

00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:13.546 line:5%,start
The pressure is on you.

00:00:13.613 --> 00:00:14.481 line:5%,start
They need to get over it.

00:00:14.547 --> 00:00:16.182 line:5%,start
They've been jealous
since Maddie from day one,

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:17.117 line:5%,start
and they still are.

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:18.885 line:5%,start
We wanted you to say to her,

00:00:18.952 --> 00:00:20.253 line:5%,start
-"why did you lie?"
-Why did you lie to me?

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.389 line:5%,start
ABBY: I keep telling you,
it's tough getting to the top.

00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:24.124 line:5%,start
It's even harder to stay there.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.493 line:5%,start
So don't go out there
and make any mistakes.

00:00:27.327 --> 00:00:28.194 line:5%,start
(slamming sound)

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:30.497 line:5%,start
(crying)
I fell and my gut hurts.

00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:32.565 line:5%,start
Me and Christi.

00:00:32.632 --> 00:00:34.300 line:5%,start
(screaming)
Christi and I, you idiot!

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:35.368 line:5%,start
Christi and I!

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:37.570 line:5%,start
<i>Coming up on </i>Dance Moms...

00:00:37.637 --> 00:00:39.172 line:5%,start
-Done.
-(bleep) you.

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.707 line:5%,start
I told you to do it for today.

00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:45.078 line:5%,start
These mothers,
the way they talk to you,

00:00:45.145 --> 00:00:46.746 line:5%,start
I think it's awful.

00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:50.650 line:5%,start
When those women say bad things
about you, it hurts my heart.

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:52.452 line:5%,start
ANNOUNCER: <i>Please welcome, Paige.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:55.755 line:5%,start
(cheering and applause)

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.962 line:95%,end
(theme music playing)

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:04.497 line:95%,end
SINGER:
<i>âª Get up âª</i>

00:01:04.564 --> 00:01:06.332 line:95%,end
<i>âª Get on the floor âª</i>

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:11.905 line:95%,end
<i>âª My world is with my girls</i>
<i>living on the dance floor âª</i>

00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:13.740 line:5%,start
(upbeat music playing)

00:01:13.807 --> 00:01:15.608 line:5%,start
(sirens wailing)

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:18.478 line:5%,start
ABBY: Girls, let's go!
Hurry up.

00:01:20.146 --> 00:01:22.916 line:95%,end
Girls, you walked into this room

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:25.752 line:95%,end
just as sluggish and boring

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:27.387 line:95%,end
as you walked out on that stage...

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:30.657 line:95%,end
zero energy.

00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:33.660 line:95%,end
<i>When my girls step on stage,</i>
<i>they're slugs.</i>

00:01:33.726 --> 00:01:35.161 line:95%,end
<i>They walk on stage.</i>

00:01:35.228 --> 00:01:36.296 line:95%,end
<i>They do the routine.</i>

00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:39.966 line:5%,start
And as the two and a half minutes go on,

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:41.734 line:5%,start
you can see their stamina decline.

00:01:41.801 --> 00:01:43.303 line:95%,end
You have to come out there with energy.

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.272 line:95%,end
You can't get halfway through
the number and then peter out.

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:50.577 line:95%,end
(dance music playing)

00:01:50.643 --> 00:01:51.878 line:95%,end
You're boring.

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:57.417 line:95%,end
So at the bottom of the pyramid, Maddie.

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:02.055 line:5%,start
I don't feel that Maddie deserve to be
on the bottom of the pyramid

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:03.756 line:5%,start
because she rocked the group dance.

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:05.758 line:95%,end
<i>I couldn't keep my eyes off of her.</i>

00:02:05.825 --> 00:02:08.294 line:95%,end
<i>She came out with a bang,</i>
<i>and she ended with a bang.</i>

00:02:09.062 --> 00:02:10.930 line:95%,end
But you know, everybody
has to have a chance

00:02:10.997 --> 00:02:11.998 line:95%,end
to be on the top of the pyramid.

00:02:12.832 --> 00:02:15.135 line:95%,end
ABBY: Maddie, you had
an opportunity to dance.

00:02:15.702 --> 00:02:17.137 line:95%,end
That didn't happen.

00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:20.173 line:95%,end
They announced you,
and you're bawling in the audience.

00:02:20.874 --> 00:02:22.275 line:95%,end
That is unacceptable behavior.

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:23.176 line:95%,end
You're nine years old.

00:02:23.243 --> 00:02:26.613 line:95%,end
When opportunity knocks,
open the door.

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:29.816 line:95%,end
MADDIE: <i>I was the very first one</i>
<i>on the bottom of the pyramid.</i>

00:02:29.883 --> 00:02:34.020 line:5%,start
And I didn't want to let her down
and I think I did.

00:02:34.087 --> 00:02:36.389 line:95%,end
Next, Mackenzie.

00:02:36.456 --> 00:02:40.126 line:95%,end
Mackenzie, your routine
was a winning number.

00:02:40.193 --> 00:02:42.095 line:95%,end
You were 10.
I don't do 10.

00:02:43.596 --> 00:02:45.899 line:95%,end
Next, Paige.

00:02:46.432 --> 00:02:47.567 line:95%,end
You went out there.

00:02:47.634 --> 00:02:49.169 line:95%,end
You looked great.
You forgot a step.

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:50.503 line:95%,end
You can't forget a step.

00:02:51.204 --> 00:02:52.705 line:95%,end
Brooke.

00:02:52.772 --> 00:02:56.209 line:95%,end
Brooke, you're here because
you give me this much.

00:02:56.743 --> 00:02:59.812 line:95%,end
I don't see this effervescent personality.

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:01.581 line:95%,end
You see this fake little smile.

00:03:01.981 --> 00:03:05.151 line:95%,end
You're concentrating so much
to not screw up the dance.

00:03:05.218 --> 00:03:07.320 line:95%,end
You can't have fun out there.

00:03:07.387 --> 00:03:09.122 line:95%,end
Next, I have Nia.

00:03:09.923 --> 00:03:11.324 line:95%,end
Nia, again, you're here

00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:13.826 line:95%,end
because you showed responsibility.

00:03:14.427 --> 00:03:15.461 line:95%,end
You quit fooling around.

00:03:15.528 --> 00:03:17.830 line:95%,end
And I didn't have to hear
your mouth all day long.

00:03:17.897 --> 00:03:18.898 line:95%,end
Yes?

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.768 line:95%,end
And on top of the pyramid,
again, is Chloe.

00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:23.636 line:95%,end
Chloe, you did your solo.

00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:28.341 line:95%,end
SINGER:
<i>âª I'll keep on burning âª</i>

00:03:30.076 --> 00:03:32.078 line:95%,end
But listen to me, I want more.

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:36.282 line:95%,end
This week, we are going
to the Energy Dance Competition

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:37.617 line:95%,end
in Chicago.

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:42.121 line:95%,end
So we had a great competition
the last time we were in Chicago,

00:03:42.622 --> 00:03:43.456 line:95%,end
but we didn't win.

00:03:44.524 --> 00:03:45.858 line:95%,end
I'd like to win.

00:03:45.925 --> 00:03:50.496 line:95%,end
Nia, you and Mackenzie
will be doing a duet.

00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:52.632 line:95%,end
(clapping)

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:54.400 line:95%,end
Paige, you have a solo.

00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:56.669 line:95%,end
It's not a reward.

00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:59.772 line:95%,end
You can screw up your own dance
by missing the choreography,

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:00.974 line:95%,end
but you can't mess up other people.

00:04:01.941 --> 00:04:04.377 line:95%,end
Brooke, you also have a solo.

00:04:04.777 --> 00:04:09.215 line:95%,end
Chloe, your solo is called "Unchained."

00:04:09.282 --> 00:04:11.451 line:95%,end
But you know what the rule is--

00:04:11.517 --> 00:04:13.987 line:95%,end
you're not in class, no solo.

00:04:14.053 --> 00:04:16.122 line:95%,end
So we need to figure out
what went on last night.

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:18.558 line:95%,end
I had three faculty members
come and tell me,

00:04:18.625 --> 00:04:19.759 line:95%,end
where's Chloe?

00:04:19.826 --> 00:04:20.994 line:95%,end
Why isn't Chloe in class?

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.195 line:95%,end
She was at the doctor.

00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:24.330 line:95%,end
But you need to have some
type of common courtesy

00:04:24.397 --> 00:04:25.865 line:95%,end
or at least say,

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:27.467 line:95%,end
"Hey, I'm taking my kid to the doctor.

00:04:27.533 --> 00:04:28.868 line:95%,end
I'll bring a doctor's excuse."

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:29.836 line:95%,end
I have one.

00:04:29.902 --> 00:04:31.304 line:95%,end
ABBY: Good.

00:04:31.371 --> 00:04:33.740 line:95%,end
Now girls, I look at this pyramid

00:04:33.806 --> 00:04:35.341 line:95%,end
and I don't even want to do a group dance

00:04:35.408 --> 00:04:36.576 line:95%,end
because you're lazy.

00:04:36.643 --> 00:04:37.477 line:95%,end
You're lifeless.

00:04:37.543 --> 00:04:39.112 line:95%,end
And you don't give me 150%.

00:04:39.178 --> 00:04:43.216 line:95%,end
Now this routine is about zombies

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:45.184 line:95%,end
because that's what I think
you are on stage.

00:04:45.818 --> 00:04:47.387 line:95%,end
You get out there
and you're like a zombie,

00:04:47.453 --> 00:04:50.189 line:95%,end
you're like sleeping half the time.

00:04:50.256 --> 00:04:52.191 line:95%,end
Holly, you're not working anymore.

00:04:52.258 --> 00:04:53.960 line:95%,end
You've all the time in the world.

00:04:54.027 --> 00:04:57.230 line:95%,end
So you are in charge of the costumes.


00:04:57.297 --> 00:04:58.264 line:95%,end
For the group number?

00:04:58.331 --> 00:04:59.666 line:95%,end
ABBY: Yes.

00:04:59.732 --> 00:05:01.567 line:5%,start
I am not looking forward
to creating the costumes

00:05:01.634 --> 00:05:03.436 line:5%,start
for this group number.

00:05:03.503 --> 00:05:05.571 line:5%,start
Costuming is not my specialty.

00:05:05.638 --> 00:05:07.473 line:95%,end
All right. Moms, you're dismissed.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.642 line:95%,end
Holly, don't procrastinate.

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:11.411 line:95%,end
Everybody else spread apart.

00:05:11.477 --> 00:05:15.715 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:05:19.886 --> 00:05:23.523 line:5%,start
Give me a big grand plie
and wiggle your head back.

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:24.590 line:5%,start
(makes noises)

00:05:24.657 --> 00:05:26.993 line:5%,start
<i>This week, the number called "Glam"</i>

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.227 line:95%,end
is all about zombies.

00:05:28.294 --> 00:05:30.463 line:95%,end
<i>And after last week's travesty,</i>

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.732 line:95%,end
<i>I really need these girls</i>
<i>to get it together.</i>

00:05:32.799 --> 00:05:33.866 line:95%,end
<i>I need to win.</i>

00:05:33.933 --> 00:05:36.636 line:95%,end
The kids are busts on a statue.

00:05:36.703 --> 00:05:38.771 line:95%,end
So it's like you have the long column,

00:05:38.838 --> 00:05:40.640 line:95%,end
and then you have their head
sitting on top of it.

00:05:40.707 --> 00:05:42.508 line:95%,end
<i>It's a very cool effect.</i>

00:05:42.575 --> 00:05:43.810 line:95%,end
I hope the judges get it.

00:05:44.577 --> 00:05:46.646 line:95%,end
Make sure you hit that
back attitude, Paige.

00:05:46.713 --> 00:05:48.047 line:95%,end
SINGER:
<i>âª Go, go, go, go âª</i>

00:05:48.114 --> 00:05:49.349 line:95%,end
ABBY: Go Nia.

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:51.451 line:95%,end
More, Paige.

00:05:51.517 --> 00:05:52.418 line:95%,end
It's not little.

00:05:52.485 --> 00:05:53.453 line:95%,end
It's big, Paige.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.889 line:95%,end
I don't think it's fair that Maddie
was last in the pyramid.

00:05:56.956 --> 00:06:01.394 line:95%,end
I'm pissed at Abby that she told
Maddie she wasn't doing a solo.

00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:03.396 line:95%,end
<i>And Maddie wasn't prepared.</i>

00:06:03.463 --> 00:06:05.898 line:95%,end
So Melissa, do you think
that Maddie being in--

00:06:05.965 --> 00:06:10.069 line:95%,end
and Mackenzie being at the bottom
of the pyramid is because of you?

00:06:11.304 --> 00:06:14.307 line:95%,end
I mean, like, my kids are always
on the bottom of the pyramid

00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:15.441 line:95%,end
because of things I did.

00:06:15.508 --> 00:06:16.342 line:95%,end
(chuckles)
I know.

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:18.411 line:95%,end
And you know, you're not
getting along with Abby

00:06:18.478 --> 00:06:19.545 line:95%,end
the best right now.

00:06:19.612 --> 00:06:21.647 line:95%,end
Do you think that's why
she's at bottom of the pyramid?

00:06:21.714 --> 00:06:23.816 line:95%,end
No. Everything's fine.

00:06:23.883 --> 00:06:25.685 line:95%,end
I mean, it's never going to be what it was

00:06:25.752 --> 00:06:27.186 line:95%,end
because she doesn't need me anymore.

00:06:27.253 --> 00:06:29.789 line:95%,end
She has someone else to take
care of all of her business.

00:06:29.856 --> 00:06:33.326 line:95%,end
I'm not working at the front desk
anymore actually for Abby

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:35.895 line:95%,end
because we did find someone
to replace me.

00:06:35.962 --> 00:06:37.797 line:95%,end
And I really don't have the time.

00:06:37.864 --> 00:06:40.933 line:95%,end
I miss it terribly,
and the people miss me.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.002 line:95%,end
I get emails every day from people.

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:44.570 line:95%,end
But I just don't have the time.

00:06:44.637 --> 00:06:46.973 line:95%,end
I don't think it has anything to do
with me, to be honest with you.

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:48.007 line:95%,end
See, I don't agree with that.

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:49.742 line:95%,end
-I really don't.
-MELISSA: You don't?

00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:52.979 line:95%,end
The reason she's at the bottom
is because you didn't kiss her ass

00:06:53.045 --> 00:06:54.847 line:95%,end
and do everything she wanted
you to do last week.

00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:57.450 line:95%,end
I'm getting so much slack from everybody

00:06:57.517 --> 00:06:59.619 line:95%,end
that, you know, I always kiss
your butt and everything.

00:06:59.685 --> 00:07:00.787 line:95%,end
So what's the issue?

00:07:00.853 --> 00:07:01.754 line:95%,end
-I don't think (indistinct)
-I think you need

00:07:01.821 --> 00:07:02.855 line:95%,end
to confront her more.

00:07:02.922 --> 00:07:05.391 line:95%,end
<i>I think Melissa has retired</i>
<i>from her duties</i>

00:07:05.458 --> 00:07:08.494 line:5%,start
at the front desk because frankly,
she's made it quite clear

00:07:08.561 --> 00:07:09.996 line:5%,start
that she doesn't need to work anymore.

00:07:10.062 --> 00:07:12.365 line:95%,end
And I think that has caused a rift
between her and Abby

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:15.101 line:95%,end
because Abby's used to Melissa
being at her beck and call.

00:07:15.168 --> 00:07:16.269 line:95%,end
Stand up for yourself.

00:07:17.837 --> 00:07:20.840 line:5%,start
(upbeat music playing)

00:07:22.308 --> 00:07:24.277 line:95%,end
ABBY: Stop.
I gave that whole speech--

00:07:24.677 --> 00:07:26.012 line:95%,end
big! Big!

00:07:26.078 --> 00:07:28.714 line:95%,end
Paige is doing a solo this week, finally.

00:07:28.781 --> 00:07:30.183 line:95%,end
<i>She is doing "Tongue Twister."</i>

00:07:30.249 --> 00:07:33.419 line:95%,end
<i>Now this is a number</i>
<i>that she did a year ago.</i>

00:07:33.486 --> 00:07:35.988 line:95%,end
And we never actually finished it

00:07:36.055 --> 00:07:37.690 line:95%,end
and she never did it on stage.

00:07:37.757 --> 00:07:39.225 line:95%,end
Face!

00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:40.827 line:95%,end
You have the face. Use it.

00:07:41.928 --> 00:07:44.096 line:95%,end
This week, my solo has
a little bit of everything--

00:07:44.163 --> 00:07:46.466 line:95%,end
<i>jazz, acro, gymnastics.</i>

00:07:46.532 --> 00:07:48.067 line:95%,end
I like this solo a lot.

00:07:48.134 --> 00:07:49.535 line:95%,end
Right. Get over there in the corner.

00:07:49.602 --> 00:07:52.472 line:95%,end
Remember, you either make a fool
out of yourself or you win.

00:07:52.538 --> 00:07:53.873 line:95%,end
The option is up to you.

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:54.774 line:95%,end
Go.

00:07:56.108 --> 00:07:57.109 line:95%,end
Brooke, let's see it.

00:07:57.176 --> 00:08:00.513 line:5%,start
(dance music playing)

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:01.981 line:5%,start
Oh, right there.
Get in your feet.

00:08:02.048 --> 00:08:03.616 line:95%,end
Get off your heels.

00:08:03.683 --> 00:08:07.086 line:95%,end
Brooke has her work cut
out for her this week.

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:09.755 line:95%,end
<i>This solo is tough.</i>

00:08:09.822 --> 00:08:12.191 line:95%,end
<i>Her routine is called</i>
<i>"Paint the Picture"</i>

00:08:12.258 --> 00:08:15.394 line:95%,end
because she actually makes
pictures with her body.

00:08:15.461 --> 00:08:18.464 line:95%,end
<i>She has one trick after</i>
<i>another after another.</i>

00:08:18.531 --> 00:08:20.566 line:95%,end
<i>So her stamina needs to be built up.</i>

00:08:20.633 --> 00:08:22.935 line:95%,end
And she has to knock
one out of the park.

00:08:23.002 --> 00:08:26.339 line:95%,end
You're dismissed.
Have your mother meet me outside, pronto.

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:32.645 line:95%,end
I want to talk to you--a couple things.

00:08:32.712 --> 00:08:35.147 line:95%,end
-Okay.
-First of all, Paige has a prop.

00:08:35.214 --> 00:08:36.182 line:95%,end
She has the chair.

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:39.452 line:95%,end
The chair needs some rubber
stoppers on the bottom of it

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:41.487 line:95%,end
so that doesn't move
on her on stage.

00:08:41.554 --> 00:08:42.722 line:95%,end
-Okay.
-So I'm letting you

00:08:42.788 --> 00:08:44.323 line:95%,end
take that chair home tonight.

00:08:45.291 --> 00:08:46.826 line:95%,end
Get whatever you need done to it.

00:08:46.893 --> 00:08:49.195 line:95%,end
And make sure tomorrow,
she has it to practice with.

00:08:49.262 --> 00:08:50.897 line:95%,end
The other thing I want
to talk to you about

00:08:50.963 --> 00:08:53.199 line:95%,end
is Brooke and the voice lessons.

00:08:53.566 --> 00:08:56.168 line:95%,end
I want her to take from the woman
that teaches here.

00:08:56.235 --> 00:08:58.638 line:95%,end
I don't care what you've heard.
I don't care if you like her or not.

00:08:58.704 --> 00:09:00.339 line:95%,end
<i>Brooke wants to sing.</i>

00:09:00.406 --> 00:09:02.074 line:95%,end
And I think Brooke does have a nice voice.

00:09:02.141 --> 00:09:05.545 line:95%,end
<i>But it's not about walking around</i>
<i>singing to your iPod.</i>

00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:09.148 line:95%,end
It's learning to read sheet music,
learning your scales.

00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:10.316 line:95%,end
<i>Get a clue, "mom-ager."</i>

00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:11.384 line:95%,end
I manage her.

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:13.853 line:95%,end
You signed the piece of paper
that I manage her.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.187 line:95%,end
-Okay.
-ABBY: And I want to be able to hear her.

00:09:15.254 --> 00:09:17.590 line:95%,end
You manage her with dance.

00:09:17.657 --> 00:09:20.059 line:95%,end
This is something I want
to do with my daughter.

00:09:20.126 --> 00:09:22.595 line:95%,end
I don't want it to have anything
to do with Abby.

00:09:22.662 --> 00:09:23.996 line:95%,end
And Abby is just so pushy.

00:09:24.063 --> 00:09:26.265 line:95%,end
She just wants to be
in charge of everything.

00:09:26.332 --> 00:09:28.334 line:95%,end
Well, I don't think you know
what you're doing.

00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:30.403 line:95%,end
Okay. If you want her to take
a voice lesson here,

00:09:30.469 --> 00:09:31.304 line:95%,end
I will do that.

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:33.873 line:95%,end
-That's fine. I just wanted (indistinct)
-But that has to do with you

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.474 line:95%,end
getting her this opportunity.

00:09:35.541 --> 00:09:37.777 line:95%,end
Kelly, why do you act this way?
I've been telling her.

00:09:37.843 --> 00:09:39.712 line:95%,end
I told her 20 times in the last month--

00:09:39.779 --> 00:09:40.680 line:95%,end
why aren't you taking voice?

00:09:40.746 --> 00:09:42.114 line:95%,end
Why aren't you taking voice?

00:09:42.181 --> 00:09:43.249 line:95%,end
You want to do it?

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:45.985 line:95%,end
All right. Then do it.

00:09:46.052 --> 00:09:47.954 line:95%,end
When I say sing, sing.


00:09:50.923 --> 00:09:52.658 line:95%,end
(dramatic music playing)

00:09:52.725 --> 00:09:54.026 line:95%,end
-Hey.
-Hi.

00:09:54.093 --> 00:09:55.561 line:95%,end
-MELISSA: Um...
-Yeah.

00:09:55.628 --> 00:09:57.897 line:95%,end
All the kids leave
and they run to get out of here.

00:09:57.964 --> 00:10:00.800 line:95%,end
And my daughter, I have to drag her
by the hair to leave.

00:10:00.866 --> 00:10:01.934 line:95%,end
-You know how that is.
-ABBY: I know.

00:10:02.001 --> 00:10:03.836 line:5%,start
Since Maddie hasn't had
a solo in two weeks,

00:10:03.903 --> 00:10:06.806 line:5%,start
she really hasn't had that
private time with anyone

00:10:06.872 --> 00:10:08.107 line:95%,end
like the other girls have had.

00:10:08.174 --> 00:10:11.444 line:95%,end
So I just wanted her to just
have a little time with Abby

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:13.112 line:95%,end
<i>and keep her skill level up.</i>

00:10:13.179 --> 00:10:14.814 line:95%,end
She hasn't been dancing
a lot this last week.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.782 line:95%,end
Can she have a private
with you tomorrow

00:10:16.849 --> 00:10:18.584 line:95%,end
-for an hour?
-An hour?

00:10:18.651 --> 00:10:19.986 line:95%,end
-Or whatever.
-I don't know if I have an hour.

00:10:20.052 --> 00:10:21.520 line:95%,end
Oh, that's fine.
Even half an hour, I don't care--

00:10:21.587 --> 00:10:23.623 line:95%,end
But you know, I have all
the solo music for her.

00:10:23.689 --> 00:10:26.192 line:95%,end
I have costumes drawn.
I have ideas.

00:10:26.258 --> 00:10:28.861 line:95%,end
-But she does not have the confidence.
-What?

00:10:28.928 --> 00:10:30.997 line:95%,end
She doesn't have the fire
even in the group dance.

00:10:31.063 --> 00:10:33.833 line:95%,end
She was much better
than everybody else.

00:10:33.899 --> 00:10:36.902 line:95%,end
<i>When Melissa approached me about</i>
<i>teaching Maddie in private,</i>

00:10:36.969 --> 00:10:37.837 line:5%,start
I thought, "You know what?

00:10:37.903 --> 00:10:39.805 line:5%,start
This is my chance
to get into Maddie's head

00:10:39.872 --> 00:10:41.140 line:5%,start
and find out what's going on."

00:10:41.207 --> 00:10:42.074 line:95%,end
Yes. Absolutely.

00:10:42.141 --> 00:10:42.975 line:95%,end
-Okay.
-Okay.

00:10:43.042 --> 00:10:45.344 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:10:49.515 --> 00:10:51.183 line:5%,start
Cartwheel one.

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:52.351 line:5%,start
Cartwheel two.

00:10:52.418 --> 00:10:53.252 line:5%,start
Woo.

00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:57.790 line:5%,start
I've selected the "Circus, Circus" music
for Mackenzie and Nia's duet.

00:10:57.857 --> 00:10:59.458 line:95%,end
Run, run, dive. Go.

00:10:59.525 --> 00:11:00.660 line:95%,end
To one knee.

00:11:01.627 --> 00:11:02.561 line:95%,end
Roll.

00:11:02.628 --> 00:11:06.499 line:5%,start
My duet this week with Nia
is an acro dance.

00:11:06.565 --> 00:11:07.867 line:95%,end
And I'm really excited.

00:11:07.933 --> 00:11:09.235 line:95%,end
And go.

00:11:09.301 --> 00:11:12.071 line:95%,end
One, two.

00:11:12.138 --> 00:11:13.572 line:95%,end
NIA:
<i>It's called "Circus, Circus."</i>

00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:15.174 line:5%,start
I love the circus.

00:11:15.241 --> 00:11:18.411 line:95%,end
So Mackenzie is going to be the lion.

00:11:18.477 --> 00:11:20.379 line:95%,end
<i>And Nia will be the lion tamer.</i>

00:11:20.446 --> 00:11:21.313 line:95%,end
<i>It's cute.</i>

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:22.281 line:95%,end
They'll have fun doing it.

00:11:22.348 --> 00:11:24.884 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:11:29.188 --> 00:11:32.792 line:95%,end
(singing scales)

00:11:32.858 --> 00:11:34.727 line:95%,end
KATHY: There it is.
When you sing C--

00:11:34.794 --> 00:11:36.862 line:95%,end
(nasally) You kind of got to get it
in your nose a little bit.

00:11:36.929 --> 00:11:40.866 line:5%,start
Abby's making me go
to her voice teacher

00:11:40.933 --> 00:11:43.302 line:95%,end
that she has teaching at our studio.

00:11:43.369 --> 00:11:45.071 line:95%,end
And her name is Kathy.

00:11:45.137 --> 00:11:46.672 line:95%,end
You have to open your mouth
no matter how horrible it looks.

00:11:47.373 --> 00:11:48.774 line:95%,end
-Hey, there you are.
-Hello.

00:11:48.841 --> 00:11:50.109 line:95%,end
And where have you been, miss?

00:11:50.176 --> 00:11:51.744 line:95%,end
-Oh, teaching.
-KATHY: Oh, well, okay.

00:11:51.811 --> 00:11:52.745 line:95%,end
How's she doing?

00:11:52.812 --> 00:11:55.347 line:95%,end
I think she can sing as well
as she wants to sing.

00:11:56.082 --> 00:11:57.283 line:95%,end
That's nice to hear.

00:11:57.349 --> 00:12:01.287 line:95%,end
I've been telling Brooke
20 times in the last month--

00:12:01.353 --> 00:12:03.989 line:95%,end
I've said Brooke,
"Take a voice lesson."

00:12:04.056 --> 00:12:05.257 line:95%,end
-All right. Now where's...
-(indistinct) almost done.

00:12:05.324 --> 00:12:06.659 line:95%,end
...didn't you write a song?

00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:07.760 line:95%,end
KATHY: Let's hear it.

00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:11.130 line:95%,end
<i>âª In that record round and round âª</i>

00:12:11.197 --> 00:12:14.500 line:95%,end
<i>âª Because I can't get enough</i>
<i>of that summer sound âª</i>

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:15.935 line:95%,end
ABBY: Woo.

00:12:16.001 --> 00:12:17.636 line:95%,end
-Thank you.
-We did it. You're welcome.

00:12:17.703 --> 00:12:20.573 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>Kelly, walk your kid</i>
<i>30 feet down the hallway.</i>

00:12:20.639 --> 00:12:22.441 line:95%,end
Take a voice lesson once a week.

00:12:22.508 --> 00:12:23.542 line:95%,end
<i>That's all I'm saying.</i>

00:12:23.609 --> 00:12:24.977 line:95%,end
All right. So you have to decide.

00:12:25.044 --> 00:12:28.013 line:95%,end
And you tell your mother,
this is what we're doing.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.381 line:95%,end
-Yes?
-Okay.

00:12:29.448 --> 00:12:32.318 line:95%,end
Because I don't want any
"mom-ager" ruining you.

00:12:32.384 --> 00:12:36.922 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:12:38.224 --> 00:12:39.391 line:95%,end
HOLLY: <i>Okay.</i>
<i>We've got step up shop.</i>

00:12:40.059 --> 00:12:41.694 line:95%,end
Woo. Full of goodies.

00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:43.996 line:95%,end
<i>Abby assigned me a challenge</i>

00:12:44.063 --> 00:12:46.632 line:5%,start
of creating the costumes
for the group dance.

00:12:46.699 --> 00:12:49.268 line:95%,end
<i>I think that Abby doesn't</i>
<i>think I can do it.</i>

00:12:49.335 --> 00:12:52.872 line:95%,end
I refuse to give her the satisfaction
of seeing me fail.

00:12:52.938 --> 00:12:54.707 line:95%,end
Here are some images that I came up--

00:12:54.774 --> 00:12:55.808 line:95%,end
-Scary images.
-Oh, I want my kids

00:12:55.875 --> 00:12:57.042 line:95%,end
to wear the toe shoes.

00:12:57.109 --> 00:13:00.479 line:95%,end
<i>This week's number</i>

returning from the dead.

00:13:02.047 --> 00:13:05.384 line:5%,start
And they have to kind of like
breathe life back into dance

00:13:05.451 --> 00:13:06.919 line:95%,end
because, apparently,
they're so boring

00:13:06.986 --> 00:13:08.788 line:95%,end
when you watch them on stage,
according to Abby.

00:13:08.854 --> 00:13:10.089 line:95%,end
-The legs.
-They don't look exactly like that,

00:13:10.156 --> 00:13:12.391 line:95%,end
but they were the inspiration behind.

00:13:12.458 --> 00:13:14.493 line:5%,start
We are going to stick
together as a group.

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.095 line:5%,start
And we are going to make the costumes.

00:13:16.162 --> 00:13:17.463 line:95%,end
And we're going to do them fabulous.

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:19.899 line:95%,end
I think once we dye it,

00:13:19.965 --> 00:13:21.100 line:95%,end
then we need to get some, like,

00:13:21.167 --> 00:13:22.701 line:95%,end
-dark, like, black, and stuff...
-Darker.

00:13:22.768 --> 00:13:25.004 line:95%,end
...and like put around these edges.

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:26.639 line:95%,end
We are ripping costumes.

00:13:26.705 --> 00:13:28.440 line:95%,end
<i>We're cutting things up.</i>

00:13:28.507 --> 00:13:29.875 line:95%,end
<i>We're distressing them.</i>

00:13:29.942 --> 00:13:32.478 line:95%,end
And then we just made some
grass stains on them.


00:13:32.545 --> 00:13:35.848 line:95%,end
We spent $20 on that dress.

00:13:35.915 --> 00:13:38.184 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>Kelly is taking all</i>
<i>of her frustrations for Abby</i>

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:40.419 line:95%,end
<i>out on this poor little</i>
<i>prom dress on the floor,</i>

00:13:40.486 --> 00:13:42.021 line:95%,end
<i>like, digging it into the dirt,</i>

00:13:42.087 --> 00:13:43.689 line:95%,end
like, I hate you, Abby.

00:13:43.756 --> 00:13:45.391 line:95%,end
-Oh, look at that!
-(yells)

00:13:45.457 --> 00:13:47.026 line:95%,end
That looks distressed.

00:13:47.092 --> 00:13:50.429 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:13:53.532 --> 00:13:55.501 line:5%,start
Five, six, seven, go.

00:13:55.968 --> 00:13:58.938 line:5%,start
One--Chloe, you're too slow.

00:13:59.004 --> 00:14:01.273 line:95%,end
Energy! What are you doing?
Come on!

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:03.375 line:95%,end
A hot pink effin' rhinestone chair.

00:14:03.442 --> 00:14:04.743 line:95%,end
I've heard it before.

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:06.245 line:95%,end
I should have.

00:14:06.312 --> 00:14:09.515 line:95%,end
I was so busy trying to get
everything together

00:14:09.582 --> 00:14:11.150 line:95%,end
to make these costumes.

00:14:11.217 --> 00:14:13.385 line:95%,end
Which reminds me,
you took care of your prop, right?

00:14:13.452 --> 00:14:14.653 line:95%,end
That's good.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.889 line:95%,end
<i>It totally slipped my mind that</i>

00:14:16.956 --> 00:14:18.824 line:95%,end
I had to do all this work
to Paige's chair.

00:14:18.891 --> 00:14:21.360 line:95%,end
Oh, I was supposed to buy stoppers.

00:14:21.427 --> 00:14:22.461 line:95%,end
Uh...

00:14:22.528 --> 00:14:24.930 line:95%,end
ABBY: Wow. That's great energy, Brook.

00:14:24.997 --> 00:14:28.701 line:95%,end
Not one to make me get up
and dance--boring.

00:14:28.767 --> 00:14:30.336 line:95%,end
Yawning.

00:14:30.402 --> 00:14:31.604 line:95%,end
Sloppy.

00:14:32.938 --> 00:14:34.306 line:95%,end
Lazy.

00:14:34.373 --> 00:14:35.374 line:95%,end
She's yelling at them

00:14:35.441 --> 00:14:38.777 line:95%,end
because their facial expressions
are not expressing energy?

00:14:38.844 --> 00:14:40.446 line:95%,end
What does a zombie's facial
expression look like?

00:14:40.512 --> 00:14:42.681 line:95%,end
-Exactly. Like, they're dead.
-HOLLY: That's what I'm thinking, yeah.

00:14:42.748 --> 00:14:44.583 line:95%,end
All right.
(snaps finger)

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:46.619 line:95%,end
Solo. Get your chair.
Let's go.

00:14:46.685 --> 00:14:48.254 line:95%,end
CHRISTI:
<i>Paige needs her chair.</i>

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.521 line:95%,end
-Paige needs her chair.
-KELLY: Okay.

00:14:49.588 --> 00:14:50.556 line:95%,end
Okay. Go.

00:14:54.126 --> 00:14:55.361 line:95%,end
It's all done.

00:14:55.427 --> 00:14:59.265 line:95%,end
(dramatic music playing)

00:15:00.866 --> 00:15:01.767 line:95%,end
You're just doing it now?

00:15:01.834 --> 00:15:03.836 line:95%,end
Didn't you take that home last night?

00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:05.170 line:95%,end
I told her to take the chair.

00:15:05.237 --> 00:15:06.772 line:95%,end
<i>As soon as the chair</i>
<i>came into the room</i>

00:15:06.839 --> 00:15:07.907 line:95%,end
and I touched it

00:15:07.973 --> 00:15:10.943 line:95%,end
and I saw that my hands
were black with marker,

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:13.412 line:95%,end
<i>I knew right then and there,</i>
<i>her mother, Kelly,</i>

00:15:13.479 --> 00:15:16.015 line:95%,end
left the chair in the studio.

00:15:16.081 --> 00:15:16.916 line:95%,end
Dingbat.

00:15:16.982 --> 00:15:18.517 line:95%,end
Oh, look. She's looking to see if it's--

00:15:21.487 --> 00:15:22.688 line:95%,end
ABBY:
<i>Where are the stoppers?</i>

00:15:22.755 --> 00:15:24.723 line:95%,end
I wanted these rubber stoppers.

00:15:25.157 --> 00:15:26.926 line:95%,end
I'll have them for the competition.

00:15:26.992 --> 00:15:28.861 line:95%,end
ABBY: No stoppers.
I mean, really?

00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:31.196 line:95%,end
<i>This is important, Kelly.</i>

00:15:31.263 --> 00:15:32.197 line:95%,end
Do something!

00:15:32.898 --> 00:15:33.999 line:95%,end
(slamming sounds)

00:15:34.066 --> 00:15:34.967 line:95%,end
ABBY: Done!

00:15:35.034 --> 00:15:36.201 line:95%,end
(gasps)

00:15:37.903 --> 00:15:38.737 line:95%,end
(bleep) you, Abby.

00:15:38.804 --> 00:15:40.005 line:95%,end
ABBY: You don't need them
for the competition.

00:15:40.072 --> 00:15:41.774 line:95%,end
I told you to do it for today.

00:15:43.242 --> 00:15:44.176 line:95%,end
Now, look at that language.

00:15:44.243 --> 00:15:46.312 line:95%,end
Doesn't that embarrass you

00:15:46.378 --> 00:15:48.147 line:95%,end
that she has to use language like that?

00:15:48.213 --> 00:15:50.416 line:95%,end
That's a--what a truck driver uses.

00:15:50.482 --> 00:15:51.717 line:95%,end
MELISSA:
Why would she do that to Paige?

00:15:51.784 --> 00:15:53.052 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: She threw the chair.

00:15:53.118 --> 00:15:54.453 line:95%,end
You're finished.

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:55.554 line:95%,end
Next.

00:15:56.622 --> 00:15:57.623 line:95%,end
Who's solo?

00:15:58.657 --> 00:16:00.592 line:95%,end
KELLY:
<i>Why are you punishing Paige?</i>

00:16:00.659 --> 00:16:04.196 line:95%,end
Abby should have left the room,
came and spoke to me.

00:16:04.263 --> 00:16:05.864 line:95%,end
And I would have explained to her

00:16:05.931 --> 00:16:07.900 line:95%,end
why she had no stoppers on her chair--

00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:10.869 line:95%,end
because I was busy doing
Abby Lee Miller's job,

00:16:10.936 --> 00:16:12.304 line:95%,end
making her costumes.

00:16:12.371 --> 00:16:13.672 line:95%,end
Oh.

00:16:13.739 --> 00:16:14.807 line:95%,end
Go get Paige.

00:16:14.873 --> 00:16:16.475 line:95%,end
(bleep) (indistinct)

00:16:16.542 --> 00:16:18.143 line:95%,end
(bleep).

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:25.551 line:95%,end
You know what, Abby?

00:16:25.617 --> 00:16:26.719 line:95%,end
We're done.

00:16:26.785 --> 00:16:28.053 line:95%,end
You're not doing a solo.

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.755 line:95%,end
Neither of my kids are doing
your group dance.

00:16:29.822 --> 00:16:31.123 line:95%,end
-That's fine.
-KELLY: Okay?

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:32.658 line:95%,end
-That's fine.
-Good luck making--

00:16:32.725 --> 00:16:34.927 line:95%,end
paying your bills without my tuition.

00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:36.895 line:95%,end
(sobbing)

00:16:36.962 --> 00:16:39.365 line:95%,end
I pay for costumes and props.

00:16:39.431 --> 00:16:40.332 line:95%,end
And I don't get them.

00:16:40.399 --> 00:16:44.703 line:95%,end
I've been here all day
making costumes for you

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:46.772 line:95%,end
while you were down the road eating.

00:16:46.839 --> 00:16:47.906 line:95%,end
Stop eating!

00:16:47.973 --> 00:16:49.508 line:95%,end
That's why you're fat.

00:16:49.575 --> 00:16:50.642 line:95%,end
Good bye.

00:16:51.944 --> 00:16:53.579 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>You were a mean girl</i>
<i>when you were 12.</i>

00:16:53.645 --> 00:16:54.813 line:95%,end
You're still a mean girl.

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:56.615 line:95%,end
(crying)
I want to go home.

00:16:56.682 --> 00:16:58.050 line:95%,end
We are.

00:16:58.117 --> 00:17:00.919 line:95%,end
Paige was frightened because
Abby is a 400-pound woman

00:17:00.986 --> 00:17:02.888 line:95%,end
and threw a chair
with my daughter in the room.

00:17:02.955 --> 00:17:05.557 line:95%,end
You can credit me for the rest
of my tuition for the month.

00:17:06.558 --> 00:17:08.360 line:95%,end
And rip up my credit card number.

00:17:09.762 --> 00:17:10.763 line:95%,end
(slams door)


00:17:12.731 --> 00:17:15.467 line:5%,start

00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:19.304 line:5%,start
KELLY: <i>So I made an agreement</i>
<i>with my girls</i>

00:17:19.371 --> 00:17:20.973 line:5%,start
that I would take them to the studio.

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.543 line:95%,end
<i>But I was gonna stay outside with the moms</i>
<i>and do the costumes.</i>

00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:26.912 line:95%,end
I just did not want to argue with Abby.

00:17:27.713 --> 00:17:29.348 line:95%,end
My kids want to go in and dance.

00:17:29.415 --> 00:17:31.450 line:95%,end
Like, if I go in there,
she's just gonna fight with me.

00:17:31.517 --> 00:17:33.285 line:95%,end
-You can count on that.
-So can they go in with you and Nia?

00:17:33.352 --> 00:17:35.120 line:95%,end
HOLLY: I'll walk the girls in.

00:17:35.187 --> 00:17:37.456 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: I think Kelly came
back because she wants

00:17:37.523 --> 00:17:40.059 line:5%,start
to prove to Paige and Brooke
that you don't let your team down.

00:17:40.125 --> 00:17:41.994 line:95%,end
I'm here because my kids want to be here.

00:17:42.061 --> 00:17:43.796 line:95%,end

-KELLY: Paige.

00:17:43.862 --> 00:17:44.696 line:95%,end
What?

00:17:44.763 --> 00:17:45.931 line:95%,end
Don't let her upset you.

00:17:47.032 --> 00:17:49.134 line:95%,end
Good thing they're children
and they, like,

00:17:49.201 --> 00:17:52.204 line:95%,end
can just forget about all this crap,
because I don't know.

00:17:52.271 --> 00:17:53.539 line:95%,end
I have a hard time forgetting it.

00:17:54.673 --> 00:17:56.408 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Hi, honey.

00:17:56.475 --> 00:17:57.543 line:95%,end
Hello.

Oh, isn't it gorgeous?

00:18:00.479 --> 00:18:02.081 line:95%,end
It is so nice.

00:18:03.749 --> 00:18:06.318 line:95%,end
-MELISSA: What I think is that we need a--
-Hustle. Hustle. Hustle.

00:18:06.385 --> 00:18:08.454 line:95%,end
ABBY:
Paige and Brooke come back into rehearsal.

00:18:10.122 --> 00:18:11.256 line:95%,end

We're good to go.

(interposing voices)

00:18:22.501 --> 00:18:24.770 line:95%,end
Aw, Claire and Mackenzie
would have fun out here.

00:18:24.837 --> 00:18:25.971 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>I think it was nice for us</i>

00:18:26.038 --> 00:18:28.740 line:95%,end
<i>to actually get outside</i>
<i>and work on the costumes</i>

00:18:28.807 --> 00:18:29.808 line:95%,end
<i>and get fresh air.</i>

00:18:29.875 --> 00:18:31.810 line:95%,end
I just think it was a nice change for us.

00:18:31.877 --> 00:18:33.378 line:95%,end
Just because Abby's an ass,

Chloe with "Unchained."

<i>Chloe's routine is called "Unchained."</i>

00:18:57.536 --> 00:18:59.471 line:5%,start
It's very avant garde.

<i>It's more of a jazz repertoire.</i>

00:19:01.006 --> 00:19:04.243 line:95%,end
<i>And again,</i>
<i>I think this is a good number for Chloe.</i>

00:19:04.309 --> 00:19:05.310 line:95%,end
Faster!

CHLOE:
<i>I think the style and the music,</i>

00:19:11.283 --> 00:19:15.254 line:5%,start
it's more like darker and mysterious.

Stomach.

Yes.

00:19:26.098 --> 00:19:26.932 line:95%,end
It's good.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.469 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Kelly, I am not only happy

00:19:30.536 --> 00:19:32.905 line:95%,end
to see you back and the girls back,

00:19:32.971 --> 00:19:34.373 line:95%,end
I'm also happy to see the costumes.

00:19:34.439 --> 00:19:36.041 line:95%,end
We did some great work yesterday.

00:19:36.108 --> 00:19:37.109 line:95%,end
<i>We're wrapping up.</i>

00:19:37.176 --> 00:19:39.711 line:95%,end
We've done just about
everything we could possibly do

00:19:39.778 --> 00:19:40.879 line:95%,end
<i>to these costumes.</i>

00:19:40.946 --> 00:19:43.248 line:95%,end
And I'm feeling really good about them.

00:19:43.315 --> 00:19:45.717 line:95%,end
You're the best team ever.

00:19:45.784 --> 00:19:47.252 line:95%,end
KELLY: I feel like a zombie.

00:19:47.986 --> 00:19:50.289 line:95%,end
(tense music playing)

00:19:50.355 --> 00:19:52.324 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Okay.
Let's hurry up and get in there.

00:19:52.391 --> 00:19:55.661 line:5%,start
It's really great that Maddie is going
to be able to have a technique private.

00:19:55.727 --> 00:19:57.396 line:95%,end
<i>Plie </i>flex.

00:19:57.462 --> 00:19:58.730 line:95%,end
Feet. Feet.

00:19:58.797 --> 00:19:59.998 line:95%,end
See that hip up. Feet.

00:20:00.065 --> 00:20:02.834 line:95%,end
<i>I know that Melissa is worried</i>
<i>about Maddie not doing solo.</i>

00:20:02.901 --> 00:20:07.539 line:95%,end
<i>I know she cannot stand it that her kid</i>
<i>is not the center of my attention.</i>


00:20:07.606 --> 00:20:08.740 line:95%,end
<i>I get that.</i>

00:20:08.807 --> 00:20:10.142 line:95%,end
Seven, eight.

00:20:10.209 --> 00:20:11.910 line:95%,end
Stretch back to your shoulders.

00:20:11.977 --> 00:20:13.412 line:95%,end
<i>But I am not giving in.</i>

00:20:13.478 --> 00:20:14.580 line:95%,end
Maddie has to want it.

00:20:14.646 --> 00:20:17.883 line:95%,end
You didn't have a solo last week.
You don't have a solo this week.

00:20:19.351 --> 00:20:22.187 line:95%,end
You need to have that fire back in you.

00:20:23.188 --> 00:20:25.357 line:95%,end
You love to dance,
and I know that.

00:20:25.424 --> 00:20:28.660 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Of course, I started to cry,
because she loves Miss Abby.

00:20:28.727 --> 00:20:30.395 line:95%,end
<i>They do have this special thing.</i>

00:20:30.462 --> 00:20:31.797 line:95%,end
I never had that with a teacher.

00:20:31.863 --> 00:20:36.468 line:95%,end
But ever since New Jersey
and you exited that stage,

00:20:36.535 --> 00:20:37.636 line:95%,end
you're not the same Maddie.

00:20:37.703 --> 00:20:39.605 line:95%,end
I don't see that fire in you.

00:20:39.671 --> 00:20:42.674 line:95%,end
You have to show us that you want it bad.

00:20:42.741 --> 00:20:43.742 line:95%,end
You know--

00:20:43.809 --> 00:20:45.644 line:95%,end
Hey, Mom.
Please don't cry.

00:20:45.711 --> 00:20:47.779 line:95%,end
She loves to be here.

00:20:47.846 --> 00:20:49.248 line:95%,end
You know that?

00:20:49.314 --> 00:20:50.315 line:95%,end
You know I love you?

00:20:50.382 --> 00:20:51.917 line:95%,end
-ABBY: I know.
-And when those women

00:20:51.984 --> 00:20:53.252 line:95%,end
say bad things about you,

00:20:53.318 --> 00:20:54.386 line:95%,end
it hurts my heart.

00:20:54.453 --> 00:20:56.054 line:95%,end
And it hurts Maddie's heart too.

00:20:56.121 --> 00:20:57.823 line:95%,end
MADDIE:
<i>And I just walked right out of the room.</i>

00:20:57.889 --> 00:21:00.392 line:5%,start
I was like, I'm embarrassed,
so I need to leave.

00:21:00.459 --> 00:21:03.428 line:95%,end
MELISSA: These mothers,
the way they talk to you.

00:21:03.495 --> 00:21:07.065 line:95%,end
I think it's awful how these
kids disrespect you too.

00:21:07.132 --> 00:21:09.167 line:95%,end
Chloe rolls her eyes
in class all the time.

00:21:09.234 --> 00:21:10.836 line:95%,end
-I know. I know
-What I'm upset about

00:21:10.902 --> 00:21:14.439 line:95%,end
is that Chloe leaves class
early all the time.

00:21:14.506 --> 00:21:16.375 line:95%,end
On Monday,
she went to the doctors.

00:21:16.441 --> 00:21:19.044 line:95%,end
And Kelly,
Christi's so-called best friend,

00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:20.379 line:95%,end
which they're not,

00:21:20.445 --> 00:21:24.016 line:95%,end
called me and said, oh, Christi is taking
Chloe's out of school early today

00:21:24.082 --> 00:21:25.050 line:95%,end
to take her to the doctor's.

00:21:25.117 --> 00:21:26.551 line:95%,end
And then she's taking her to the movies.

00:21:27.552 --> 00:21:30.122 line:95%,end
ABBY: Melissa, don't worry
about these three mothers

00:21:30.188 --> 00:21:31.857 line:95%,end
that don't know their right foot
from their left.

00:21:31.923 --> 00:21:33.225 line:95%,end
Who cares what they think?

00:21:33.292 --> 00:21:34.893 line:95%,end
They're just jealous of our relationship.

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.628 line:95%,end
And they got to get over it,
like, you know.

00:21:36.695 --> 00:21:37.963 line:95%,end
That has nothing to do with Maddie.

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:39.031 line:95%,end
I know that.

00:21:39.097 --> 00:21:42.901 line:95%,end
But always remember,
I have her best interests.

00:21:42.968 --> 00:21:44.936 line:95%,end
-You always have my daughters'--
-ABBY: Where did she go?

00:21:45.003 --> 00:21:46.772 line:95%,end
She better be somewhere
working on those feet

00:21:46.838 --> 00:21:48.206 line:95%,end
and not playing around.

00:21:51.043 --> 00:21:54.146 line:5%,start
(mellow music playing)

00:22:00.218 --> 00:22:04.256 line:95%,end
ABBY:
<i>So I get on the bus and no Kelly.</i>

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:06.191 line:95%,end
Woo. Hallelujah.

00:22:06.258 --> 00:22:09.061 line:95%,end
<i>Kelly can use her gas, her mileage.</i>

00:22:09.127 --> 00:22:10.429 line:95%,end
She just better get there.

00:22:10.495 --> 00:22:11.930 line:95%,end
She better be there on time.

00:22:11.997 --> 00:22:13.965 line:95%,end
And those kids better be well rested.

00:22:14.032 --> 00:22:16.001 line:95%,end
Bus driver, where are you going?

00:22:16.068 --> 00:22:17.502 line:95%,end
This is not the correct way.

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:24.343 line:95%,end
(tense music playing)

00:22:25.777 --> 00:22:29.047 line:5%,start
ABBY: <i>We're going to Energy</i>
<i>Dance in Chicago, Illinois.</i>

00:22:29.114 --> 00:22:31.416 line:95%,end
You know,
Chicago is the Midwest.

00:22:31.483 --> 00:22:32.751 line:95%,end
It's a big city.

00:22:32.818 --> 00:22:35.654 line:95%,end
There's lots of amazing schools
that attend the competitions.

00:22:35.721 --> 00:22:38.557 line:95%,end
<i>So the girls need to come out</i>
<i>with more energy,</i>

00:22:38.623 --> 00:22:40.792 line:95%,end
<i>more enthusiasm, and more sass.</i>

00:22:40.859 --> 00:22:42.794 line:95%,end
<i>They can't be all about zombies.</i>

00:22:44.963 --> 00:22:46.465 line:95%,end
Paige is on in 20 minutes.

00:22:46.531 --> 00:22:48.433 line:95%,end
And she's not in here.
She's not ready.

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:50.369 line:95%,end
And I can't find her anywhere.

00:22:50.435 --> 00:22:52.104 line:95%,end
-CHRISTI: Maybe she's--
-She's not backstage.

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:54.673 line:95%,end
(tense music playing)


00:22:55.807 --> 00:22:57.142 line:5%,start
(tense music playing)

00:22:57.209 --> 00:22:58.877 line:5%,start
ABBY: Paige is on in 20 minutes.

00:22:58.944 --> 00:23:00.712 line:95%,end
And she's not in here.
She's not ready.

00:23:00.779 --> 00:23:01.980 line:95%,end
And I can't find her anywhere.

00:23:02.848 --> 00:23:03.915 line:95%,end
She's not backstage.

00:23:04.383 --> 00:23:07.619 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>I don't know why Kelly, Brooke,</i>
<i>and Paige aren't at the competition.</i>

00:23:07.686 --> 00:23:09.921 line:5%,start
I haven't had an opportunity
to talk to Kelly

00:23:09.988 --> 00:23:11.223 line:95%,end
<i>because I'm busy getting Chloe ready.</i>

00:23:11.289 --> 00:23:13.925 line:95%,end
So I don't really know
what Kelly's mindset is at this point.

00:23:13.992 --> 00:23:16.995 line:95%,end
She should be in here, warming up,
preparing, ready to go on.

00:23:18.296 --> 00:23:20.565 line:95%,end
MELISSA: <i>My daughter is nine years old.</i>
<i>She's not 18.</i>

00:23:20.632 --> 00:23:22.401 line:5%,start
She doesn't make her own decisions.

00:23:22.467 --> 00:23:25.003 line:5%,start
And I'm gonna speak for my daughter.

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:28.707 line:95%,end
So I pulled Maddie aside
and had a little chat with her.

00:23:28.774 --> 00:23:31.777 line:95%,end
Say, "Miss Abby, I really
want to do my solo today.

00:23:31.843 --> 00:23:33.745 line:95%,end
I want to show you
how wonderful it is."

00:23:33.812 --> 00:23:36.314 line:95%,end
Like, you know how Paige is?
How she's, like, real perky.

00:23:36.381 --> 00:23:38.116 line:95%,end
You can't walk out like this.

00:23:38.183 --> 00:23:40.519 line:95%,end
You have to go in there perky,
like your perky Maddie self.

00:23:40.585 --> 00:23:41.653 line:95%,end
Don't go in with this face.

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:43.922 line:95%,end
Remember that face,
I always say I hate that face, Maddie.

00:23:43.989 --> 00:23:44.823 line:95%,end
Don't freak out.

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:45.724 line:95%,end
Okay?

00:23:45.791 --> 00:23:47.359 line:95%,end
You're fine, happy.

00:23:47.426 --> 00:23:48.827 line:95%,end
Turn it.

00:23:48.894 --> 00:23:51.363 line:5%,start
MADDIE: My mom encouraged me
to go talk to Abby

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:53.231 line:5%,start
and say I was ready to do a solo.

00:23:53.298 --> 00:23:57.035 line:95%,end
<i>So I'm totally confident</i>
<i>and I'm ready to compete.</i>

00:23:57.102 --> 00:23:59.438 line:95%,end
Can you please come
in the hall with me?

00:23:59.504 --> 00:24:01.673 line:95%,end
You want me to come out
in the hall and run your number?

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:03.508 line:95%,end
-Yeah.
-ABBY: You don't even have a number.

00:24:03.575 --> 00:24:05.310 line:95%,end
<i>Maddie asked if she could talk to me.</i>

00:24:05.377 --> 00:24:06.912 line:95%,end
<i>Now, perfect example,</i>

00:24:06.978 --> 00:24:09.047 line:5%,start
that's a kid taking the initiative,

00:24:09.114 --> 00:24:11.817 line:5%,start
asking an adult politely,
"Can I speak with you?"

00:24:11.883 --> 00:24:12.884 line:95%,end
Sure.

00:24:13.418 --> 00:24:15.420 line:95%,end
I want to do my solo.

00:24:15.487 --> 00:24:17.189 line:95%,end
-ABBY: Are you ready?
-MADDIE: Yes.

00:24:17.255 --> 00:24:18.390 line:95%,end
Can you beat everybody?

00:24:18.457 --> 00:24:19.724 line:95%,end
I think, yeah.

00:24:19.791 --> 00:24:21.793 line:95%,end
But you don't look--
you're like, yes.

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:22.861 line:95%,end
I think, yes.

00:24:22.928 --> 00:24:24.529 line:95%,end
Maddie, if you don't want to do it,
don't do it.

00:24:24.596 --> 00:24:25.597 line:95%,end
-Nobody cares.
-I want to.

00:24:25.664 --> 00:24:27.432 line:95%,end
ABBY: You act like someone's
making you do it.

00:24:27.499 --> 00:24:28.967 line:95%,end
<i>I want to do my solo.</i>

00:24:29.034 --> 00:24:30.335 line:95%,end
I think I can do my solo.

00:24:30.402 --> 00:24:32.504 line:95%,end
I'm ready to do my solo--very wishy-washy.

00:24:32.571 --> 00:24:34.272 line:95%,end
That's not a game face.

00:24:34.339 --> 00:24:36.274 line:95%,end
That's not the Maddie face I know,

00:24:36.341 --> 00:24:38.376 line:95%,end
the Maddie that's jumping and warming up,

00:24:38.443 --> 00:24:39.578 line:95%,end
trying to psych Chloe up.

00:24:39.644 --> 00:24:41.012 line:95%,end
You go out there with that face,

00:24:41.079 --> 00:24:42.747 line:95%,end
she's gonna beat the crap out of you.

00:24:42.814 --> 00:24:45.016 line:95%,end
I think you don't want to dance
because you think she's gonna beat you.

00:24:45.083 --> 00:24:46.818 line:95%,end
MELISSA: She wants to dance.
She's just afraid of you.

00:24:46.885 --> 00:24:47.953 line:95%,end
ABBY: Don't talk for her.

00:24:48.019 --> 00:24:49.287 line:95%,end
Well, I am talking.
I'm her mom.

00:24:49.354 --> 00:24:51.022 line:95%,end
ABBY: Of course, without a beat,

00:24:51.089 --> 00:24:52.824 line:95%,end
<i>up comes Melissa.</i>

00:24:52.891 --> 00:24:54.493 line:95%,end
"Abby, she's ready.
She really wants to do this."

00:24:54.559 --> 00:24:55.560 line:95%,end
Da da da. Da da.

00:24:55.627 --> 00:24:56.828 line:95%,end
I'm like, shh.

00:24:56.895 --> 00:24:58.296 line:95%,end
It's not about you, Melissa.

00:24:58.363 --> 00:24:59.531 line:95%,end
It's not your decision.

00:24:59.598 --> 00:25:00.899 line:95%,end
Stop with the tears.

00:25:00.966 --> 00:25:03.902 line:95%,end
Babies cry, not you.

00:25:03.969 --> 00:25:05.403 line:95%,end
-Do you understand that?
-Yes.

00:25:06.171 --> 00:25:07.506 line:95%,end
It's my dance company.

00:25:07.572 --> 00:25:09.808 line:95%,end
I say who's dancing and who isn't.

00:25:09.875 --> 00:25:12.043 line:95%,end
So I'm looking at this kid
and I thought, you know what,

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:13.178 line:95%,end
<i>throw her out there.</i>

00:25:13.245 --> 00:25:15.480 line:95%,end
<i>She needs to know if she comes to me</i>
<i>and asks me for something,</i>

00:25:16.481 --> 00:25:17.482 line:95%,end
then it means business.

00:25:17.549 --> 00:25:18.750 line:95%,end
And we're going through with it.

00:25:18.817 --> 00:25:21.486 line:95%,end
-What I'm trying to do is enter Maddie.
-Okay.

00:25:21.553 --> 00:25:23.889 line:95%,end
ABBY: So I'm just letting
you know that these two,

00:25:23.955 --> 00:25:25.690 line:95%,end
I haven't seen since we
walked in the building.

00:25:25.757 --> 00:25:26.925 line:95%,end
-We're not gonna scratch.
-Okay.

00:25:26.992 --> 00:25:28.326 line:95%,end
So we need to add Maddie--

00:25:28.393 --> 00:25:30.128 line:95%,end
I need you to enforce your rules.

00:25:30.195 --> 00:25:32.063 line:95%,end
So if you call them and they're not here,

00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:33.999 line:95%,end
and you call them again
and they're not here,

00:25:34.065 --> 00:25:35.867 line:95%,end
-then they're an automatic scratch.
-Okay.

00:25:35.934 --> 00:25:37.936 line:95%,end
Now I registered Maddie.

00:25:38.003 --> 00:25:39.938 line:95%,end
We put her in no problem.

00:25:40.005 --> 00:25:41.139 line:95%,end
We're good to go.

to run your solo. Here.

00:25:45.477 --> 00:25:46.845 line:95%,end
Maddie is going to do her solo.

00:25:47.512 --> 00:25:48.713 line:95%,end

tells us that Maddie is now doing a solo,

00:25:52.083 --> 00:25:54.452 line:95%,end
<i>I thought, well, it's par for the course.</i>

00:25:54.519 --> 00:25:56.221 line:95%,end
<i>I think Abby's greatest pleasure in life</i>

00:25:56.288 --> 00:25:58.089 line:95%,end
<i>is to put Maddie and Chloe</i>
<i>against one another.</i>

00:25:58.156 --> 00:26:00.025 line:95%,end
<i>So this is obviously something planned.</i>

Get out there and show her
how good you are,

00:26:07.098 --> 00:26:09.000 line:95%,end
and that you don't need
your teacher to help you.

00:26:09.067 --> 00:26:10.602 line:95%,end

00:26:10.669 --> 00:26:11.937 line:95%,end

We are dancing.

00:26:14.172 --> 00:26:15.874 line:5%,start
I just didn't want to deal with Abby.

00:26:15.941 --> 00:26:18.643 line:5%,start
I did not want to ride on a bus

HOLLY: Kelly and Abby have
a very long history.

00:26:37.395 --> 00:26:39.197 line:5%,start
And I think with that long history,

00:26:39.264 --> 00:26:40.632 line:95%,end
<i>there's a lot of tension.</i>

00:26:40.699 --> 00:26:42.834 line:95%,end

00:26:42.901 --> 00:26:43.735 line:95%,end

KELLY: <i>Paige is running her solo</i>

<i>With Maddie during her solo,</i>

00:26:59.718 --> 00:27:02.220 line:95%,end
<i>Paige is just nonexistent to Abby.</i>


00:27:02.287 --> 00:27:03.421 line:95%,end

-KELLY: Nothing against you, Maddie.

00:27:24.109 --> 00:27:26.111 line:95%,end
I'm just saying,
they need to give my kids more time

00:27:26.177 --> 00:27:27.512 line:95%,end

-Oh, I agree.

00:27:27.579 --> 00:27:28.980 line:95%,end

-It has nothing to do with you.

00:27:29.047 --> 00:27:31.282 line:95%,end

I will allow them

00:33:41.619 --> 00:33:44.022 line:5%,start
I just want to support
Kelly as a friend.

00:33:44.088 --> 00:33:47.158 line:5%,start
Whatever decision she makes,
I want to stand behind that.

00:33:47.225 --> 00:33:48.393 line:95%,end
She's conflicted as a mom.

00:33:48.459 --> 00:33:50.061 line:95%,end
What is the right decision?

00:33:50.128 --> 00:33:52.730 line:95%,end
If that's your choice
to have them not perform,

00:33:52.797 --> 00:33:55.533 line:95%,end
then we will stand by you
as your friends.

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:58.069 line:95%,end
They sat in that audience
and watched your kids dance.

00:33:58.569 --> 00:34:02.907 line:95%,end
And I know all they wanted to do
was go and do their dances.

00:34:02.974 --> 00:34:05.243 line:95%,end
So I don't want to do it
to them more.

CHRISTI: <i>Abby is a grudge holder.</i>

from the group,

it's just going to perpetuate
this fight longer.

Abby, what about
this for the blood?

00:35:42.673 --> 00:35:43.908 line:95%,end
I've never made blood before.

00:35:43.975 --> 00:35:47.211 line:95%,end

that Abby expected me to fail.

I mean for once,
it's actually working.

00:39:24.962 --> 00:39:27.965 line:95%,end
She's trying to come up
with some excuse,

00:39:28.032 --> 00:39:31.736 line:95%,end
some reason for her kids

00:39:31.802 --> 00:39:33.104 line:95%,end
Well, you know what?

No, we won't.

ran there's 10 times

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:57.962 line:95%,end
That's not fair.

My daughter

00:40:01.499 --> 00:40:04.502 line:95%,end
because you've made
her feel flustered.

00:40:04.568 --> 00:40:05.736 line:95%,end
You didn't have time
to run your dance?

00:40:05.803 --> 00:40:07.138 line:95%,end
What is this "run your dance" crap?

If you don't know by the time
you get to the venue,

What else do you want me to do?

00:40:12.376 --> 00:40:14.845 line:95%,end
I was ready.
I was here to play ball.

I tell you to put stoppers

Put stoppers on the chair
and paint it black.

00:40:20.284 --> 00:40:22.887 line:95%,end
Don't blame me and pass
the buck on everybody else.

00:40:22.953 --> 00:40:24.822 line:95%,end
You screwed up,
like you always do.

00:40:24.889 --> 00:40:26.757 line:5%,start
Quit enabling them.

00:40:26.824 --> 00:40:28.826 line:5%,start
I want kids that want to dance.

00:40:28.893 --> 00:40:31.362 line:5%,start
I want kids
that want to be here.

00:40:31.429 --> 00:40:33.731 line:5%,start
And if your kid
isn't one of them, cut your losses,

00:40:33.798 --> 00:40:36.267 line:5%,start
break your studio contract, and go.

00:40:36.333 --> 00:40:39.470 line:5%,start
And Kelly, I was the first one
at the hospital

00:40:39.537 --> 00:40:42.173 line:5%,start
when your husband
ran over your kid's foot.

00:40:42.239 --> 00:40:44.608 line:5%,start
I was in the hospital room
hugging your kid.

00:40:44.675 --> 00:40:46.811 line:5%,start
And now you say
those things about me.

00:40:46.877 --> 00:40:47.878 line:5%,start
How dare you?

00:40:47.945 --> 00:40:49.213 line:5%,start
Your kid doesn't want to dance.

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:51.048 line:5%,start
They're lazy.
And they don't like to lose.
