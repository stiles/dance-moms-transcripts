This weekend, we will be traveling

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.638 line:5%,start
to Miami Beach, Florida.

00:00:05.705 --> 00:00:07.307 line:5%,start
(cheering)

00:00:07.374 --> 00:00:09.909 line:5%,start
CATHY:<i> I got Kendall</i>
<i>a performance opportunity.</i>

00:00:09.976 --> 00:00:11.578 line:5%,start
You'll be spectacular for me.

00:00:11.644 --> 00:00:13.046 line:5%,start
-Okay.
-This is great for us.

00:00:13.113 --> 00:00:16.349 line:5%,start
I would like for Nia
to be considered for the trio.

00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:17.817 line:5%,start
This is my domain.

00:00:17.884 --> 00:00:19.185 line:5%,start
I'm the principal here.

00:00:19.252 --> 00:00:20.653 line:5%,start
She got a solo tonight.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.055 line:5%,start
-Abby.
-And you just blew it.

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:24.491 line:95%,end
(theme music playing)

00:00:24.557 --> 00:00:25.859 line:95%,end
SINGER: <i>âª Get up âª</i>

00:00:25.925 --> 00:00:27.927 line:95%,end
<i>âª Get on the floor âª</i>

00:00:27.994 --> 00:00:33.033 line:95%,end
<i>âª My world is with my girls</i>
<i>living on the dance floor âª</i>

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:35.969 line:5%,start
(suspenseful music playing)

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:38.304 line:5%,start
ABBY: <i>Let's go, girls. Come on.</i>

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:40.273 line:95%,end
Come on. Get in here.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:46.246 line:95%,end
Last week's competition,
Fire and Ice, to me,

00:00:46.312 --> 00:00:48.248 line:95%,end
was a big disappointment, ladies.

00:00:48.314 --> 00:00:50.483 line:95%,end
I mean, here we are,
invited back as winners,

00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:53.119 line:95%,end
and you guys don't even place?

00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:54.721 line:95%,end
Not acceptable.

00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:56.923 line:95%,end
Six of you weren't in unison.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.592 line:95%,end
<i>The group, it was just</i>
<i>a complete trainwreck.</i>

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:02.629 line:95%,end
When you do partner work,
it really has to be in sync.

00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:06.566 line:95%,end
The group needs to be
cleaner, do you understand?

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:09.302 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>I am so sick of Abby</i>
<i>coming down on our kids.</i>

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:11.438 line:95%,end
<i>How are you going to be amazing on stage</i>

00:01:11.504 --> 00:01:12.806 line:5%,start
when your teacher keeps knocking you down

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:14.741 line:5%,start
and making you lose your self-confidence?

00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:17.043 line:95%,end
<i>She always puts the blame on someone else.</i>

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.213 line:95%,end
ABBY: All right, now let me
get right to the pyramid.

00:01:21.548 --> 00:01:25.118 line:95%,end
First I have Mackenzie.

00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:28.388 line:95%,end
I think your acting could have been
bigger and longer,

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:31.024 line:95%,end
and I think when you walk, we need to work

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:32.659 line:95%,end
on turning those feet out.

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:34.928 line:95%,end
Next I have Paige.

00:01:34.994 --> 00:01:37.931 line:95%,end
I was in the dressing room
all day long with you.

00:01:37.997 --> 00:01:40.800 line:95%,end
I didn't see you
utilizing your spare time,

00:01:40.867 --> 00:01:42.869 line:95%,end
and you need to do that.

00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:45.105 line:95%,end
Next, Nia.

00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:48.108 line:95%,end
I just need to see more from you.

00:01:48.174 --> 00:01:51.411 line:5%,start
HOLLY: It's tough to see Nia
at the bottom of the pyramid

00:01:51.478 --> 00:01:54.180 line:5%,start
again and again and again this week.

00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:55.849 line:95%,end
It's--it's frustrating.

00:01:55.915 --> 00:01:58.818 line:95%,end
<i>She's doing everything</i>
<i>she possibly can to get ahead.</i>

00:01:58.885 --> 00:02:01.154 line:95%,end
Moving up, Chloe.

00:02:01.754 --> 00:02:03.990 line:95%,end
Chloe, I thought you did
a nice job on your solo,

00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:05.925 line:95%,end
but your age is 10.

00:02:05.992 --> 00:02:08.228 line:95%,end
You're competing 10 to 12.

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:10.563 line:95%,end
You have to dance like a 12-year-old.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.700 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>Chloe competed against girls</i>
<i>who were years older than her</i>

00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:15.168 line:95%,end
and she still got second place.

00:02:15.235 --> 00:02:16.636 line:95%,end
The only thing Abby sees, though,

00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:17.904 line:95%,end
is that she didn't win first.

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:19.305 line:95%,end
<i>She is ridiculous.</i>

00:02:19.372 --> 00:02:21.708 line:95%,end
And next we have Brooke.

00:02:21.774 --> 00:02:24.744 line:95%,end
Once again, you danced 13 to 15.

00:02:25.245 --> 00:02:27.780 line:95%,end
At 13, you won the whole division.

00:02:27.847 --> 00:02:30.884 line:95%,end
And on the top of the pyramid is Maddie.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.319 line:95%,end
Maddie, I challenged you to see
if you could stay there

00:02:33.386 --> 00:02:35.321 line:95%,end
for two weeks in a row, and you did.

00:02:35.388 --> 00:02:37.490 line:95%,end
Now I'm challenging you again.

00:02:37.957 --> 00:02:39.259 line:95%,end
Can you make it three?

00:02:39.926 --> 00:02:42.028 line:5%,start
MADDIE: I was so happy to be
in the top of the pyramid

00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:43.596 line:5%,start
for two weeks in a row,

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:46.232 line:95%,end
<i>but also, I kind of feel bad</i>
<i>for the other girls</i>

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.201 line:95%,end
because I think
they worked very hard, too.

00:02:48.268 --> 00:02:49.602 line:95%,end
All right, now...

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:55.642 line:95%,end
this weekend,
we will be traveling

00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:57.877 line:95%,end
to Miami Beach, Florida.

00:02:57.944 --> 00:02:59.679 line:95%,end
(cheering)

00:03:00.613 --> 00:03:01.614 line:5%,start
I love Miami.

00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:02.515 line:5%,start
It's tropical.

00:03:02.582 --> 00:03:03.416 line:5%,start
It's exciting.

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:04.417 line:5%,start
It's fun.

00:03:04.484 --> 00:03:05.785 line:95%,end
<i>It's fast-paced.</i>

00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:07.253 line:95%,end
There's sun.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.488 line:95%,end
There's sand.

00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:10.223 line:95%,end
And there's boys.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.560 line:95%,end
We will all be performing a group number.

00:03:13.626 --> 00:03:14.794 line:95%,end
MACKENZIE: Even me?

00:03:15.295 --> 00:03:16.629 line:95%,end
-ABBY: Even you.
-Yay.

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:19.199 line:95%,end
ABBY: The group number
is called "Reputation."

00:03:20.066 --> 00:03:22.802 line:95%,end
I want you to think
about Annette Funicello

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:26.739 line:95%,end
and Frankie Avalon
and <i>Beach Blanket Bingo.</i>

00:03:26.806 --> 00:03:29.609 line:95%,end
PAIGE: <i>Miss Abby starts talking</i>
<i>about Annette Funicello</i>

00:03:29.676 --> 00:03:31.711 line:5%,start
and the <i>Beach Bingo.</i>

00:03:31.778 --> 00:03:34.214 line:5%,start
I have no idea what she's talking about.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.616 line:95%,end
Now moms, when those
girls get home tonight,


00:03:36.683 --> 00:03:39.419 line:95%,end
I want you to look at
some of those old movies.

00:03:39.485 --> 00:03:41.688 line:95%,end
I want the girls to see
what that's all about,

00:03:41.754 --> 00:03:43.356 line:95%,end
because that's going to be
their group number.

00:03:43.423 --> 00:03:44.657 line:95%,end
It's '60s.

00:03:44.724 --> 00:03:45.858 line:95%,end
It's pony.

00:03:45.925 --> 00:03:47.160 line:95%,end
It's swim.

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:48.461 line:95%,end
Cute, cute, cute.

00:03:48.528 --> 00:03:50.530 line:95%,end
Fun in the sun.

00:03:50.597 --> 00:03:53.266 line:95%,end
I want to see big high ponytails,

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:55.034 line:95%,end
big beautiful smiles,

00:03:55.101 --> 00:03:58.271 line:95%,end
and little itsy-bitsy '60s bikinis.

00:03:59.038 --> 00:04:00.907 line:95%,end
This week,

00:04:00.974 --> 00:04:02.308 line:95%,end
Maddie, you have another solo.

00:04:02.875 --> 00:04:05.345 line:95%,end
Chloe, you'll also be doing a solo.

00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:08.281 line:95%,end
My next soloist will be Nia.

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:14.821 line:95%,end
We also have a trio
with Maddie, Chloe, and Paige.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.993 line:95%,end
It would be nice if Nia could be
considered for the trio.

00:04:20.059 --> 00:04:23.396 line:95%,end
And, here was a possible potential
opportunity for Nia,

00:04:23.463 --> 00:04:25.198 line:95%,end
and once again, she's overlooked.

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:26.099 line:95%,end
ABBY: Yes?

00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:28.835 line:95%,end
I'm just letting you know
that I have to get my warts

00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:30.470 line:95%,end
cut out of my feet tomorrow.

00:04:30.536 --> 00:04:32.438 line:95%,end
(suspenseful music playing)

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.942 line:95%,end
They said she should be
fine to dance in three days,

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:37.543 line:95%,end
so we'll be cutting it close.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.213 line:95%,end
But I don't want to put her in a trio

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.181 line:95%,end
and then have her

00:04:42.682 --> 00:04:46.953 line:95%,end
physically be in pain
while she's learning it.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.456 line:95%,end
We can't change the appointment.
I've changed it like 15 times.

00:04:50.523 --> 00:04:52.992 line:95%,end
She's having a hard time walking on it.

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:55.261 line:95%,end
You know what?
I'm going to have to think about that.

00:04:55.328 --> 00:04:57.130 line:95%,end
I might put someone else in the trio.

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.167 line:95%,end
Plantar warts are common to dancers,

00:05:01.234 --> 00:05:03.136 line:95%,end
<i>and when you have to have them removed,</i>

00:05:03.202 --> 00:05:07.240 line:95%,end
sometimes the kid's out of a dance
for a week or two weeks.

00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:09.309 line:95%,end
You need to get that fixed.
That takes priority.

00:05:09.375 --> 00:05:12.278 line:95%,end
So we need to start working
on the script number right away.

00:05:12.345 --> 00:05:13.513 line:95%,end
It's going to be a long week.

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:14.647 line:95%,end
Suck the yawns out.

00:05:14.714 --> 00:05:16.049 line:95%,end
Quit yawning in my face.

00:05:16.115 --> 00:05:17.483 line:95%,end
Spread apart. Get ready to work.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:18.818 line:95%,end
Moms.

00:05:19.585 --> 00:05:21.387 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:05:21.454 --> 00:05:23.156 line:95%,end
(cows mooing)

00:05:23.222 --> 00:05:24.457 line:95%,end
CATHY: <i>I want resistance.</i>

00:05:24.524 --> 00:05:26.125 line:5%,start
I want the shoulders going down

00:05:26.192 --> 00:05:28.428 line:5%,start
and I want the chin going up,

00:05:28.494 --> 00:05:30.296 line:95%,end
Okay? Press those shoulders down.

00:05:30.363 --> 00:05:31.898 line:95%,end
Okay, down.

00:05:31.964 --> 00:05:32.965 line:95%,end
Lift your chin.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.834 line:95%,end
Straight.

00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:37.770 line:95%,end
All right, that was the best one yet.

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:39.806 line:95%,end
That was fabulous, Kendall.

00:05:39.872 --> 00:05:42.942 line:95%,end
<i>Abby's great at pointing</i>
<i>out all of Kendall's faults.</i>

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:45.678 line:95%,end
I don't know if she's so great
at fixing them.

00:05:45.745 --> 00:05:48.348 line:5%,start
With my tutelage and the Candy Apple name,

00:05:48.414 --> 00:05:50.616 line:5%,start
Kendall is really going to blossom.

00:05:50.683 --> 00:05:53.619 line:95%,end
I can't believe it, Cathy,
after what, 15 minutes,

00:05:54.153 --> 00:05:57.557 line:95%,end
you fixed three or four things like that?

00:05:57.623 --> 00:06:00.460 line:95%,end
CATHY: Here's the thing, Jill,
we've got what it takes back here,

00:06:00.526 --> 00:06:02.228 line:95%,end
-the foundation.
-JILL: Yeah.

00:06:02.295 --> 00:06:04.630 line:95%,end
We've got the core, no pun intended.

00:06:04.697 --> 00:06:06.632 line:95%,end
I'm just going to give
you a little secret.

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:08.101 line:95%,end
Kendall is doing really well.

00:06:08.167 --> 00:06:09.736 line:95%,end
I have big plans for her.

00:06:09.802 --> 00:06:12.105 line:95%,end
JILL: <i>Cathy says she has</i>
<i>big plans for Kendall.</i>

00:06:12.171 --> 00:06:14.006 line:5%,start
I just hope that Cathy's big plans

00:06:14.073 --> 00:06:16.109 line:95%,end
<i>are in line with my big plans.</i>

00:06:16.175 --> 00:06:18.444 line:5%,start
(upbeat music playing)

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:25.051 line:5%,start
SINGER: <i>âª Come on âª</i>

00:06:25.818 --> 00:06:29.288 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>I want to take the girls</i>
<i>back to an era of innocence,</i>

00:06:29.355 --> 00:06:34.026 line:95%,end
to Frankie and Annette
and the beach blankets

00:06:34.093 --> 00:06:36.229 line:95%,end
and the beach balls and the umbrellas.

00:06:36.295 --> 00:06:37.563 line:95%,end
If you don't point that foot,

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:38.798 line:95%,end
I'm going to come out there and break it.

00:06:38.865 --> 00:06:39.766 line:95%,end
Point your foot.

00:06:39.832 --> 00:06:41.401 line:95%,end
We're going to Miami.

00:06:42.001 --> 00:06:45.972 line:95%,end
And in South Florida, every kid dances,

00:06:46.038 --> 00:06:47.940 line:95%,end
and every kid is amazing.

00:06:48.007 --> 00:06:50.977 line:95%,end
Paige will be very upset
if she doesn't get to do the trio.

00:06:51.043 --> 00:06:51.944 line:95%,end
I agree.

00:06:52.011 --> 00:06:53.846 line:95%,end
She'll go on there and dance,
whether her foot hurts

00:06:53.913 --> 00:06:56.883 line:95%,end
<i>or not, just because she doesn't want</i>
<i>to be replaced in the trio.</i>

00:06:57.417 --> 00:06:58.985 line:95%,end
Why are you doing the surgery now?

00:06:59.051 --> 00:07:01.220 line:95%,end
You can't wait like a couple more weeks?

00:07:01.287 --> 00:07:03.556 line:95%,end
She--she's having
a hard time walking on it.

00:07:03.623 --> 00:07:06.292 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>Abby says the dancers</i>
<i>dance through pain.</i>

00:07:06.359 --> 00:07:07.827 line:95%,end
That's fine if you're on Broadway,

00:07:07.894 --> 00:07:11.564 line:95%,end
but my daughter is 11 years old,
and if she can't dance,

00:07:11.631 --> 00:07:12.965 line:95%,end
she's not dancing.


00:07:13.032 --> 00:07:15.168 line:95%,end
Did she mention what the trio
was going to be?

00:07:15.234 --> 00:07:16.602 line:95%,end
No, and I thought she would have,

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:19.338 line:95%,end
because I was wondering if she had
to switch it up who it might be,

00:07:19.405 --> 00:07:22.141 line:95%,end
because I think Nia
would have gladly stepped in.

00:07:22.208 --> 00:07:24.010 line:95%,end
Oh, Nia was volunteering herself.

00:07:24.076 --> 00:07:25.545 line:95%,end
I see that, yeah.

00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:28.514 line:95%,end
I am continuously frustrated with Abby.

00:07:28.581 --> 00:07:30.249 line:95%,end
Nia has so much to offer.

00:07:30.316 --> 00:07:31.851 line:95%,end
She has great potential.

00:07:31.918 --> 00:07:35.555 line:95%,end
<i>And yet Abby only sees one aspect of Nia,</i>

00:07:35.621 --> 00:07:38.224 line:95%,end
and I'm beginning to believe
she will never get a trio.

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:40.026 line:95%,end
I'm getting really sick and tired of it.

00:07:40.092 --> 00:07:43.095 line:95%,end
Here's my kid giving 110%,

00:07:43.162 --> 00:07:44.764 line:95%,end
and there is Abby--

00:07:44.831 --> 00:07:46.933 line:95%,end
-Who can't even give her 50%.
-She can't even give her 50%.

00:07:46.999 --> 00:07:49.469 line:95%,end
I think that you have valid points,

00:07:49.535 --> 00:07:51.871 line:95%,end
and if you really feel that strongly,

00:07:51.938 --> 00:07:54.407 line:95%,end
then maybe it's best that you tell Abby.

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:56.509 line:95%,end
Well, I just hope I can go
downstairs and be calm.

00:07:56.576 --> 00:07:59.312 line:95%,end
Because I'm usually very calm,
but I'm usually not as ticked

00:07:59.378 --> 00:08:00.780 line:95%,end
as I am tonight.

00:08:00.847 --> 00:08:03.349 line:95%,end
<i>Abby didn't give Nia the trio.</i>

00:08:03.416 --> 00:08:06.519 line:95%,end
Maybe enough is enough
and I should speak up

00:08:06.586 --> 00:08:09.689 line:95%,end
and just remind Abby
that there is someone here.

00:08:09.755 --> 00:08:11.757 line:95%,end
<i>If Paige is not able to perform,</i>

00:08:12.225 --> 00:08:13.693 line:95%,end
<i>Nia might be able to step in.</i>

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.161 line:95%,end
Okay.

00:08:15.228 --> 00:08:16.362 line:95%,end
All right, Ms. Holly.

00:08:16.429 --> 00:08:17.497 line:95%,end
Good luck.

00:08:17.563 --> 00:08:18.698 line:95%,end
All right.

00:08:18.764 --> 00:08:21.300 line:95%,end
ABBY: One, two, three, four.

00:08:22.735 --> 00:08:24.403 line:95%,end
Why are you interrupting my rehearsal?

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:26.739 line:95%,end
Can I see you for a second outside?
Just for a moment. Just for a moment.

00:08:26.806 --> 00:08:29.609 line:95%,end
Hold it. I am coming to your school.

00:08:29.675 --> 00:08:32.211 line:95%,end
I am walking into your office
and I'm going to interrupt you.

00:08:32.278 --> 00:08:33.813 line:95%,end
-It's ridiculous.
-Fine, you go ahead and do that.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.181 line:95%,end
Parents do that all the time.

00:08:35.248 --> 00:08:38.951 line:95%,end
I don't think there's anything
more invasive than being interrupted.

00:08:39.018 --> 00:08:40.620 line:95%,end
<i>Holly is now a principal.</i>

00:08:40.686 --> 00:08:43.789 line:95%,end
She, of all the mothers,
should understand.

00:08:43.856 --> 00:08:47.159 line:95%,end
I would like for Nia
to be considered for the trio.

00:08:47.226 --> 00:08:49.462 line:95%,end
You said you would consider her.

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:53.466 line:95%,end
Yet you looked at her and you looked
beyond her in pyramid

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:55.201 line:95%,end
and didn't even give her the courtesy

00:08:55.268 --> 00:08:58.804 line:95%,end
-of being considered.
-You are so far off my plans,

00:08:58.871 --> 00:08:59.939 line:95%,end
you have no clue.

00:09:00.006 --> 00:09:04.243 line:95%,end
I was already planning on Nia
being the swing for Paige in the trio,

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:06.546 line:95%,end
but Holly can't even give me three seconds

00:09:06.612 --> 00:09:08.080 line:95%,end
to let me tell her this.

00:09:08.147 --> 00:09:09.048 line:95%,end
No.

00:09:09.115 --> 00:09:11.484 line:95%,end
She has to come in,
interrupt my rehearsal again.

00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:13.319 line:95%,end
Paige might not be able to do it.

00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:14.220 line:95%,end
Nia's in.

00:09:14.287 --> 00:09:16.222 line:95%,end
-Why didn't you just say that (indistinct)
-ABBY: Nia has a solo.

00:09:16.289 --> 00:09:17.990 line:95%,end
Because you come and interrupt me.

00:09:18.057 --> 00:09:19.125 line:95%,end
You don't need to do that.

00:09:19.191 --> 00:09:20.493 line:95%,end
You don't know what my master plan is.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:21.861 line:95%,end
(interposing voices)

00:09:21.928 --> 00:09:24.630 line:95%,end
You would think she would
have a little bit of respect.

00:09:24.697 --> 00:09:26.465 line:95%,end
What I asked is that
we're on the same page.

00:09:26.532 --> 00:09:27.600 line:95%,end
That's all you have
to say, is like, Holly,

00:09:27.667 --> 00:09:29.201 line:95%,end
we're thinking the same thing.

00:09:29.268 --> 00:09:30.369 line:95%,end
That's all you had to say.

00:09:30.436 --> 00:09:32.772 line:95%,end
Yeah, but Holly, it's not about
what you're thinking.

00:09:33.706 --> 00:09:35.775 line:95%,end
I don't give a crap what you're thinking.

00:09:35.841 --> 00:09:36.676 line:95%,end
You know what?

00:09:36.742 --> 00:09:38.411 line:95%,end
It does matter what I'm thinking
because I'm her mother.

00:09:38.477 --> 00:09:39.712 line:95%,end
A mother looking out for her daughter

00:09:39.779 --> 00:09:41.581 line:95%,end
trumps the word of a dance teacher,
all of the time.

00:09:41.647 --> 00:09:44.250 line:95%,end
Not inside this studio
it doesn't, sweetheart.

00:09:44.317 --> 00:09:45.685 line:95%,end
This is my domain.

00:09:45.751 --> 00:09:47.086 line:95%,end
I'm the principal here.

00:09:47.153 --> 00:09:48.554 line:95%,end
-It's my office.
-What you fail--

00:09:48.621 --> 00:09:50.389 line:95%,end
what you fail to realize, Abby,

00:09:50.456 --> 00:09:52.558 line:95%,end
-is that you don't control me.
-I don't care of what you think.

00:09:52.625 --> 00:09:55.628 line:95%,end
I will not be bossed
around in my own studio.

00:09:55.695 --> 00:09:59.298 line:95%,end
I give Nia a solo and then I think
about putting her in the trio,

00:09:59.365 --> 00:10:00.933 line:95%,end
<i>but that's just not good enough for Holly.</i>

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.201 line:95%,end
<i>Nothing's ever good enough.</i>

00:10:02.268 --> 00:10:03.102 line:95%,end
<i>But you know what?</i>

00:10:03.169 --> 00:10:04.537 line:95%,end
Detention is good enough,

00:10:04.604 --> 00:10:06.872 line:95%,end
and that's what her and Nia both need.

00:10:06.939 --> 00:10:09.108 line:95%,end
Get the hell out. Go.

00:10:09.175 --> 00:10:10.142 line:95%,end
(gasps)

00:10:10.209 --> 00:10:11.277 line:95%,end
What did she say?

00:10:11.344 --> 00:10:12.979 line:95%,end
She had a solo tonight

00:10:13.045 --> 00:10:14.447 line:95%,end
-and you just blew it.
-Abby.

00:10:14.513 --> 00:10:16.082 line:95%,end
ABBY: You're expelled. You're done.

00:10:16.148 --> 00:10:18.217 line:95%,end
Holly didn't do me any favors.

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:20.886 line:95%,end
She ruined this entire
evening's rehearsal.

00:10:20.953 --> 00:10:22.855 line:95%,end
<i>Nia didn't even get</i>
<i>a chance to learn the trio.</i>

00:10:22.922 --> 00:10:24.357 line:95%,end
What has Holly accomplished?

00:10:24.423 --> 00:10:25.391 line:95%,end
Nothing.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.930 line:95%,end
HOLLY: There are no amount
of solos, duos, trios

00:10:30.997 --> 00:10:32.064 line:95%,end
which are worth this aggravation.

00:10:33.132 --> 00:10:34.133 line:95%,end
Are you leaving?

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.736 line:95%,end
I am never setting foot
in this studio again.

00:10:38.437 --> 00:10:41.607 line:95%,end
(dramatic music playing)


00:10:45.911 --> 00:10:47.880 line:5%,start
ABBY: <i>Let's go.</i>
<i>Take the number from the top.</i>

00:10:47.947 --> 00:10:49.415 line:5%,start
All right.

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:50.316 line:5%,start
Wait a minute.

00:10:50.383 --> 00:10:51.417 line:5%,start
Where's Nia?

00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:52.752 line:95%,end
-I don't know.
-I have no idea.

00:10:52.818 --> 00:10:54.020 line:95%,end
-She...
-ABBY: Ugh.

00:10:54.086 --> 00:10:56.322 line:5%,start
I thought after last night's blowup

00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:59.191 line:5%,start
that Holly would have time
to come to her senses.

00:10:59.258 --> 00:11:01.260 line:95%,end
She needs to have Nia at rehearsal today,

00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:02.628 line:95%,end
but Nia is not here.

00:11:02.695 --> 00:11:04.563 line:95%,end
Come on, Holly. Grow up.

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:08.367 line:95%,end
Girls, we have two days, two days,

00:11:08.434 --> 00:11:12.471 line:95%,end
before you're in Miami against
all those kids that dance

00:11:12.538 --> 00:11:14.674 line:95%,end
at a studio and at school.

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:15.775 line:95%,end
And then there were two.

00:11:15.841 --> 00:11:17.009 line:95%,end
I know.

00:11:17.076 --> 00:11:18.344 line:95%,end
-You know what, though?
-Nobody likes us.

00:11:18.411 --> 00:11:19.545 line:95%,end
The two bitches are left.

00:11:19.612 --> 00:11:20.880 line:95%,end
(laughs)

00:11:20.946 --> 00:11:23.449 line:5%,start
I don't blame Holly and Nia
for not being at rehearsal today.

00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:26.052 line:95%,end
<i>I wouldn't want to look at her, either,</i>
<i>after she talked to me that way.</i>

00:11:26.118 --> 00:11:28.387 line:95%,end
<i>I mean, Abby just pushes and pushes,</i>

00:11:28.454 --> 00:11:30.823 line:95%,end
and I hope she gets
pushed too far this time.

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:33.225 line:95%,end
Smile, over the top.

00:11:34.827 --> 00:11:36.128 line:95%,end
Watch the butt.

00:11:37.563 --> 00:11:38.631 line:95%,end
Do you think Holly will come at all?

00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:39.532 line:95%,end
I don't know.

00:11:39.598 --> 00:11:41.801 line:95%,end
I texted her and I asked her how she was,

00:11:41.867 --> 00:11:45.171 line:95%,end
and her response was, I'm not good.

00:11:45.237 --> 00:11:47.173 line:95%,end
I can't imagine her
not being her to Miami.

00:11:47.239 --> 00:11:48.741 line:95%,end
I mean, she has a solo, too,

00:11:48.808 --> 00:11:50.309 line:95%,end
-you know what I mean?
-Yeah, I know.

00:11:50.376 --> 00:11:53.079 line:5%,start
If we lose Holly, it's going to be
a devastating loss to our team.

00:11:53.145 --> 00:11:54.947 line:95%,end
<i>She's our center. She really is.</i>

00:11:55.014 --> 00:11:56.582 line:95%,end
She keeps us sane, believe it or not,

00:11:56.649 --> 00:11:58.784 line:95%,end
if we were even to be called sane.

00:11:58.851 --> 00:12:01.587 line:95%,end
I feel bad because we have
to learn this dance.

00:12:01.654 --> 00:12:03.322 line:95%,end
Then Nia will be behind.

00:12:06.258 --> 00:12:08.561 line:95%,end
Hold two, three, four.

00:12:08.627 --> 00:12:09.729 line:95%,end
And exit.

00:12:09.795 --> 00:12:10.629 line:95%,end
I think we're good.

00:12:10.696 --> 00:12:11.630 line:95%,end
I think that's a wrap.

00:12:11.697 --> 00:12:13.733 line:95%,end
I don't know where Nia is,
but rehearsal's over.

00:12:13.799 --> 00:12:14.633 line:95%,end
She missed it.

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:17.436 line:95%,end
<i>Remember, everyone's replaceable.</i>

00:12:17.503 --> 00:12:19.972 line:95%,end
(dramatic music playing)

00:12:20.873 --> 00:12:21.941 line:95%,end
-WOMAN: Hi.
-Hi.

00:12:22.007 --> 00:12:23.409 line:95%,end
We have an appointment for Paige.

00:12:23.476 --> 00:12:24.310 line:95%,end
WOMAN: Okay.

00:12:24.376 --> 00:12:25.711 line:95%,end
If you could just sign in there.

00:12:25.778 --> 00:12:27.747 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>This week,</i>
<i>Paige has to go to the doctors</i>

00:12:27.813 --> 00:12:29.582 line:95%,end
<i>to have some plantar warts removed.</i>

00:12:29.648 --> 00:12:33.319 line:95%,end
But the problem is we have
a competition this weekend,

00:12:33.385 --> 00:12:36.989 line:95%,end
so Paige only has two days
for her feet to heal.

00:12:37.056 --> 00:12:38.958 line:95%,end
DOCTOR: What's giving you trouble?

00:12:39.024 --> 00:12:40.292 line:95%,end
I have three warts.

00:12:40.359 --> 00:12:41.594 line:95%,end
DOCTOR: Three warts.

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:42.862 line:95%,end
-Do they hurt?
-PAIGE: Yeah.

00:12:42.928 --> 00:12:45.664 line:95%,end
She's a dancer, so whenever she turns,

00:12:45.731 --> 00:12:48.000 line:95%,end
the one on the ball
of her foot really hurts.

00:12:48.067 --> 00:12:50.436 line:95%,end
DOCTOR: As a dancer and wanting
to get back on your feet,

00:12:50.503 --> 00:12:53.672 line:95%,end
if you would have an infection
or slow healing,

00:12:53.739 --> 00:12:56.675 line:95%,end
or even just the discomfort
could keep her off a little bit longer.

00:12:57.176 --> 00:12:58.444 line:95%,end
I can tell you you can dance,

00:12:58.511 --> 00:13:00.613 line:95%,end
but your body may tell you
something different.

00:13:00.679 --> 00:13:01.614 line:95%,end
Okay.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:04.683 line:95%,end
These warts are bothering her feet
just to walk around in.

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:06.118 line:95%,end
<i>So, I have to get them done.</i>

00:13:06.185 --> 00:13:09.855 line:95%,end
I'm stepping up as a mom and health
is coming before dance.

00:13:11.323 --> 00:13:13.759 line:95%,end
DOCTOR: Okay, Paige, we're going
to give each one of these

00:13:13.826 --> 00:13:15.628 line:95%,end
a little zap there.

00:13:17.363 --> 00:13:18.731 line:95%,end
Here's the first one.

00:13:19.131 --> 00:13:22.134 line:95%,end
KELLY: Okay, Paige,
squeeze my hand when it hurts.

00:13:24.336 --> 00:13:25.237 line:95%,end
(zapping)

00:13:26.839 --> 00:13:28.841 line:95%,end
DOCTOR: You did great.
It wasn't too bad, was it?

00:13:28.908 --> 00:13:30.543 line:95%,end
We're going to put a Band-Aid
on each one of those

00:13:30.609 --> 00:13:32.945 line:95%,end
and then we'll give you some
ice to put on there, okay?

00:13:33.012 --> 00:13:34.613 line:95%,end
You did good, angel.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.215 line:95%,end
I hope Paige can dance this week.

00:13:36.282 --> 00:13:38.851 line:95%,end
<i>I hope that we have no complications.</i>

00:13:39.618 --> 00:13:40.719 line:5%,start
ABBY: <i>Take it from the top.</i>

00:13:41.187 --> 00:13:42.421 line:5%,start
Push.

00:13:42.488 --> 00:13:44.023 line:5%,start
Lead with that heel, Maddie.

00:13:44.723 --> 00:13:46.358 line:95%,end
<i>Maddie is doing a solo.</i>

00:13:46.425 --> 00:13:48.127 line:95%,end
<i>It's called "All of My Life."</i>

00:13:48.194 --> 00:13:49.995 line:95%,end
This is a stellar routine for her.

00:13:50.062 --> 00:13:52.565 line:95%,end
<i>It has all the elements that she needs.</i>

00:13:52.631 --> 00:13:54.400 line:95%,end
<i>She jumps. She turns.</i>

00:13:54.466 --> 00:13:57.069 line:95%,end
Her transitions are lovely.


00:13:57.136 --> 00:13:59.004 line:95%,end
But all of your life
has been dancing, right?

00:13:59.638 --> 00:14:02.975 line:95%,end
A dream's coming true
and setting new goals,

00:14:03.042 --> 00:14:05.077 line:95%,end
and that's what you need
to convey to the judges.

00:14:05.144 --> 00:14:07.346 line:95%,end
All right, out you go. Send me Chloe.

00:14:07.413 --> 00:14:08.514 line:5%,start
(dramatic music playing)

00:14:08.581 --> 00:14:10.883 line:5%,start
All right, let's go from the top
that far with the music.

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:14.386 line:95%,end
Five, six, seven, eight.

00:14:14.453 --> 00:14:15.354 line:95%,end
Look at me.

00:14:15.421 --> 00:14:17.389 line:95%,end
When you turn around there, make sure

00:14:17.456 --> 00:14:20.593 line:95%,end
you feel your shoulder blades
popping open.

00:14:20.659 --> 00:14:23.329 line:95%,end
CHLOE: <i>This week my solo</i>
<i>is called "Send Down Your Life,"</i>

00:14:23.395 --> 00:14:25.798 line:5%,start
and I'm excited to do
another contemporary lyrical

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:28.500 line:95%,end
because last week I did a more dark piece.

00:14:28.567 --> 00:14:31.203 line:95%,end
All right now, remember,
you're going to get to Miami

00:14:32.037 --> 00:14:35.908 line:95%,end
and your toughest competition
flew on the plane with you

00:14:35.975 --> 00:14:37.176 line:95%,end
from Pittsburgh.

00:14:37.877 --> 00:14:39.245 line:95%,end
Yes.

00:14:39.311 --> 00:14:40.446 line:95%,end
Be confident.

00:14:40.512 --> 00:14:42.781 line:95%,end
Pretend you're going
after 12 and 13-year-olds.

00:14:42.848 --> 00:14:43.883 line:95%,end
Got it?

00:14:43.949 --> 00:14:44.984 line:95%,end
All right.

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:46.018 line:5%,start
See ya.

00:14:47.586 --> 00:14:50.389 line:95%,end
(music playing)

00:14:50.456 --> 00:14:52.458 line:95%,end
JILL: Go in and get to class, okay?

00:14:52.524 --> 00:14:53.692 line:95%,end
-CATHY: Hey, Kendall.
-Hi.

00:14:53.759 --> 00:14:56.295 line:95%,end
The girls are waiting, so hurry up
and get changed so we can start rehearsal.

00:14:56.362 --> 00:14:57.696 line:95%,end
-Jill. Jill. Jill.
-Hurry up.

00:14:57.763 --> 00:14:58.831 line:95%,end
CATHY: Come here.

00:14:58.898 --> 00:15:00.566 line:95%,end
I'm like beaming. I'm so excited.

00:15:00.633 --> 00:15:03.168 line:95%,end
I got Kendall a performance opportunity,

00:15:03.235 --> 00:15:05.504 line:95%,end
or as they say in Hollywood,
I got her a gig.

00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:06.972 line:95%,end
You got her a gig. What?

00:15:07.039 --> 00:15:10.142 line:95%,end
Yes, an opportunity to dance
with the Harlem Globetrotters.

00:15:10.209 --> 00:15:11.777 line:95%,end
-JILL: You are kidding.
-No, isn't that fabulous?

00:15:11.844 --> 00:15:13.178 line:95%,end
It is at halftime,

00:15:13.245 --> 00:15:15.381 line:95%,end
okay, and she's going to be doing...
JILL: How fun.

00:15:15.447 --> 00:15:17.449 line:95%,end
...like a little solo out there.

00:15:17.516 --> 00:15:18.717 line:95%,end
JILL: <i>I think it's adorable.</i>

00:15:18.784 --> 00:15:20.719 line:5%,start
I think it's a perfect fit for Kendall

00:15:20.786 --> 00:15:24.990 line:5%,start
to be dancing at the halftime show
of the Harlem Globetrotters.

00:15:25.057 --> 00:15:26.525 line:95%,end
Listen, we'll talk about it later, okay?

00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:28.961 line:95%,end
-That is great. All righty.
-CATHY: All right, go get Kendall.

00:15:29.028 --> 00:15:30.129 line:95%,end
JILL: Thanks.

00:15:30.195 --> 00:15:33.532 line:95%,end
(dramatic music playing)

00:15:35.401 --> 00:15:37.369 line:95%,end
ABBY: Now listen,
you need to tell the story,

00:15:37.436 --> 00:15:40.306 line:95%,end
but you need to dance, and it's not easy.

00:15:40.372 --> 00:15:44.476 line:95%,end
We have an adorable trio,
and it's called "Ladybugs."

00:15:44.543 --> 00:15:48.714 line:95%,end
<i>The number is perfectly suited</i>
<i>for Maddie, Paige, and Chloe,</i>

00:15:48.781 --> 00:15:49.882 line:95%,end
<i>but some of the steps</i>

00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:52.318 line:95%,end
in the number are very difficult.

00:15:52.384 --> 00:15:54.019 line:95%,end
This is advanced choreography.

00:15:54.086 --> 00:15:57.589 line:95%,end
I know your feet are hurting,
but you need to cowboy up

00:15:57.656 --> 00:15:59.024 line:95%,end
and you need to dance.

00:15:59.091 --> 00:16:02.761 line:95%,end
I need to know if you can't do the steps
because your feet are sore today.

00:16:03.262 --> 00:16:04.630 line:95%,end
All right, let's do it.

00:16:06.699 --> 00:16:09.435 line:5%,start
PAIGE: <i>Yesterday, I had</i>
<i>my plantar warts removed</i>

00:16:09.501 --> 00:16:13.205 line:5%,start
and my feet are really sore,
so I'm trying my best.

00:16:13.272 --> 00:16:14.940 line:95%,end
Come on, bigger, Paige.

00:16:15.007 --> 00:16:16.275 line:95%,end
Back leg higher, Paige.

00:16:18.143 --> 00:16:21.814 line:95%,end
You're falling off your center.
Is the foot flexed or pointed, Paige?

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:22.715 line:95%,end
Pointed.

00:16:23.215 --> 00:16:24.049 line:95%,end
Really?

00:16:24.116 --> 00:16:26.385 line:95%,end
Did the doctor say no dancing for--

00:16:26.452 --> 00:16:28.587 line:95%,end
No. He said as long
as she didn't have a blister,

00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:29.855 line:95%,end
she could dance.

00:16:29.922 --> 00:16:32.558 line:95%,end
The doctor said that unless
Paige has any blistering,

00:16:32.624 --> 00:16:33.826 line:95%,end
<i>she can go ahead and dance.</i>

00:16:33.892 --> 00:16:35.194 line:95%,end
ABBY: Does it hurt to point it?

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:36.095 line:95%,end
A little bit.

00:16:36.161 --> 00:16:38.464 line:95%,end
Okay, because your foot is just like this.

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:40.966 line:95%,end
She doesn't want to be
replaced in the trio again.

00:16:41.033 --> 00:16:42.368 line:95%,end
Whoa.

00:16:44.403 --> 00:16:46.372 line:95%,end
Paige, I know your feet hurt,

00:16:46.438 --> 00:16:48.607 line:95%,end
but what happened to that
whole section you forgot?

00:16:48.674 --> 00:16:50.676 line:95%,end
If you go out there and dance
like you were today,

00:16:50.743 --> 00:16:52.344 line:95%,end
we don't have a shot at winning.

00:16:52.411 --> 00:16:54.480 line:95%,end
I'm going to have to pull you
from the number.

00:16:54.546 --> 00:16:56.115 line:95%,end
Go, you're finished.

00:16:56.181 --> 00:16:57.649 line:95%,end
Paige is really making me nervous.

00:16:57.716 --> 00:16:59.885 line:95%,end
She is hopping all over the place.

00:16:59.952 --> 00:17:02.087 line:95%,end
Her foot is really bothering her.

00:17:02.154 --> 00:17:04.390 line:95%,end
I may have no other choice
but to pull the trio

00:17:04.456 --> 00:17:05.424 line:95%,end
from the competition.


00:17:10.796 --> 00:17:12.698 line:95%,end
Have a seat over here.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:15.534 line:95%,end
-ABBY: Hey.
-Hi.

00:17:16.101 --> 00:17:17.770 line:5%,start
ABBY: Holly blew up at me the other night

00:17:17.836 --> 00:17:20.806 line:5%,start
because she wants Nia
in a trio, but they have been

00:17:20.873 --> 00:17:24.076 line:95%,end
<i>absent from rehearsals</i>
<i>for an entire day and a half.</i>

00:17:24.143 --> 00:17:26.211 line:95%,end
<i>We're leaving for Miami tomorrow.</i>

00:17:26.278 --> 00:17:28.247 line:95%,end
She definitely wants to come back.

00:17:28.313 --> 00:17:29.548 line:95%,end
Nia wants to be here.

00:17:30.015 --> 00:17:32.184 line:95%,end
And I just don't want
what happened to interfere

00:17:32.251 --> 00:17:35.587 line:95%,end
with her dance progress,
and whatever the issues

00:17:35.654 --> 00:17:36.789 line:95%,end
we have each other.

00:17:36.855 --> 00:17:40.759 line:95%,end
I would never let a kid's parent
hold me back.

00:17:40.826 --> 00:17:42.594 line:95%,end
Nia, you need to get into rehearsal.

00:17:42.661 --> 00:17:45.230 line:95%,end
I just don't want you
to let her miss rehearsals.

00:17:45.297 --> 00:17:46.365 line:95%,end
She will be here.

00:17:46.432 --> 00:17:50.269 line:95%,end
Nia makes her own opportunities.

00:17:50.335 --> 00:17:51.270 line:95%,end
She has to earn it.

00:17:51.336 --> 00:17:53.572 line:5%,start
I decided to come back
to the studio to teach Nia

00:17:53.639 --> 00:17:55.974 line:95%,end
how to take the high road,
be a bigger person,

00:17:56.041 --> 00:17:58.477 line:95%,end
and not run away from your problems.

00:17:58.544 --> 00:18:00.846 line:95%,end
-Hey, ladies.
-DANCE MOM: Hi.

00:18:00.913 --> 00:18:02.081 line:95%,end
DANCE MOM: How's it going?

00:18:02.147 --> 00:18:04.083 line:95%,end
MELISSA: So glad you're back.

00:18:05.284 --> 00:18:06.752 line:95%,end
The hardest thing was walking
through that door again

00:18:06.819 --> 00:18:08.287 line:95%,end
because I certainly
didn't want to do that.

00:18:08.353 --> 00:18:10.355 line:95%,end
Nia really wanted to come and she wanted--

00:18:10.422 --> 00:18:12.124 line:95%,end
she was worried about the group dance.

00:18:12.191 --> 00:18:13.492 line:95%,end
What a team player.

00:18:13.559 --> 00:18:14.393 line:95%,end
-HOLLY: <i>She is.</i>
-CHRISTI: <i>I know.</i>

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:15.594 line:95%,end
HOLLY: <i>It's the first thing</i>
<i>she asked about this morning</i>

00:18:15.661 --> 00:18:16.495 line:95%,end
<i>before we went to school.</i>

00:18:16.562 --> 00:18:18.297 line:95%,end
Y Am I going to the dance today?
I'm like, are you kidding me?

00:18:18.363 --> 00:18:20.799 line:95%,end
Ultimately, my daughter loves to dance.

00:18:20.866 --> 00:18:22.267 line:95%,end
She has that passion.

00:18:22.334 --> 00:18:25.237 line:95%,end
And if that means that I have
to deal with that evil witch Abby,

00:18:25.804 --> 00:18:27.840 line:95%,end
then I guess I'll just be
the bigger person.

00:18:27.906 --> 00:18:29.808 line:95%,end
ABBY: Nia, don't make any mistakes,

00:18:29.875 --> 00:18:32.344 line:95%,end
because you missed
the whole first rehearsal when I had

00:18:32.411 --> 00:18:33.679 line:95%,end
time to go through mistakes.

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:38.717 line:5%,start
(upbeat music playing)

00:18:41.053 --> 00:18:43.689 line:95%,end
Oh, Nia, did you see that left foot?

00:18:47.759 --> 00:18:49.628 line:95%,end
<i>I'm a bit concerned going to Miami.</i>

00:18:49.695 --> 00:18:51.864 line:95%,end
<i>I know there's going to be</i>
<i>amazing dancers there.</i>

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:55.267 line:95%,end
I mean, they are on their
A-game all the time.

00:18:55.334 --> 00:18:59.571 line:95%,end
Nia, that whole entire section
is what we went over and over

00:18:59.638 --> 00:19:02.341 line:95%,end
and over, and you missed it,
and that's the part you missed.

00:19:02.407 --> 00:19:03.775 line:95%,end
All right, girls, dismissed.

00:19:03.842 --> 00:19:04.843 line:95%,end
It's over.

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:07.246 line:95%,end
Nia, maybe you can practice in Florida

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.548 line:95%,end
because you don't know that section.

00:19:11.083 --> 00:19:13.886 line:95%,end
HOLLY: I know Nia wants
to do a really good job,

00:19:13.952 --> 00:19:18.590 line:95%,end
but I am worried that this week
has been a little bit too much on her.

00:19:19.658 --> 00:19:21.193 line:5%,start
ABBY: Stretch the knees.

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:22.528 line:5%,start
SINGER: <i>âª Yeah, yeah âª</i>

00:19:23.061 --> 00:19:24.296 line:95%,end
Turn out.

00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:28.033 line:95%,end
<i>Nia is doing a jazz acrobatic routine.</i>

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.603 line:5%,start
Nia didn't show up for rehearsal
for a whole day and a half.

00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:32.971 line:95%,end
<i>Will she pull it off?</i>

00:19:33.038 --> 00:19:34.239 line:95%,end
<i>I don't know.</i>

00:19:34.306 --> 00:19:35.574 line:95%,end
Forced arch.

00:19:35.641 --> 00:19:37.142 line:95%,end
Come on. (speaking French)

00:19:37.209 --> 00:19:38.810 line:95%,end
I don't see those heels touching.

00:19:39.711 --> 00:19:40.846 line:95%,end
Freeze.

00:19:41.413 --> 00:19:43.148 line:95%,end
Squeeze those ankles together. Get up.

Hold that.

Oh, for goodness sakes.

Good girl.

One person?

You didn't watch it?

00:21:02.961 --> 00:21:03.862 line:95%,end

I told your mothers to make sure
you watch the movie.

00:21:13.238 --> 00:21:14.406 line:95%,end
Come on.

Abby Lee Miller.

They are not backing up
my lessons for the girls.

00:21:24.283 --> 00:21:25.517 line:95%,end
Tell them about the movie.

00:21:25.584 --> 00:21:26.952 line:95%,end
What other moves did they do?

00:21:27.019 --> 00:21:28.520 line:95%,end
They were like going like that.

00:21:28.587 --> 00:21:31.723 line:95%,end
ABBY: The pony, the swim, the jerk.

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:33.825 line:95%,end
Are the pony, the swim,
and the jerk in your number?

00:21:33.892 --> 00:21:34.926 line:95%,end
Yes.

00:21:34.993 --> 00:21:36.828 line:95%,end
So let's see. Stand up.

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:40.465 line:95%,end
(laughs)

00:21:45.704 --> 00:21:47.205 line:95%,end
Well, the girls have worked really hard

00:21:47.272 --> 00:21:50.676 line:95%,end
and we only have a few
hours to spend on the beach.

00:21:50.742 --> 00:21:52.911 line:95%,end
-Can we go in the water?
-Yup. Can you go in the water?

00:21:52.978 --> 00:21:53.945 line:95%,end
-Yeah.
-Yes.

00:21:54.446 --> 00:21:55.914 line:95%,end
-Please.
-How about if I pick you up

00:21:55.981 --> 00:21:57.316 line:95%,end
and throw you in the water?

00:21:58.750 --> 00:21:59.685 line:95%,end
Can we go?

00:21:59.751 --> 00:22:01.520 line:95%,end
Go, go, go, go, go.

00:22:01.586 --> 00:22:03.255 line:95%,end
I don't know how cold it is, guys.

Ow. Ow, my feet.

GIRLS: (screams)

Oh.

00:22:28.647 --> 00:22:30.115 line:95%,end
(screams)

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:33.085 line:95%,end
Where's Mackenzie?

00:22:33.652 --> 00:22:35.954 line:95%,end
Oh, jeez. You had to go and lose her.

00:22:36.021 --> 00:22:38.557 line:5%,start
I could have gotten lost at sea.

00:22:38.623 --> 00:22:40.225 line:95%,end
How's Paige? How's her feet?

00:22:40.292 --> 00:22:41.793 line:95%,end
-How is she doing today?
-Yeah. Ugh.

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:44.830 line:95%,end
She has moments
that they are bothering her.

00:22:44.896 --> 00:22:47.599 line:95%,end
If you watch her watch walk,
it's like she's on her tippy toe

00:22:47.666 --> 00:22:50.469 line:95%,end
<i>on one foot and on her heel</i>
<i>on the other one.</i>

00:22:50.535 --> 00:22:52.003 line:95%,end
But I think Paige will be able to do it.

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:53.438 line:95%,end
I think Paige will be able to do it.

00:22:53.505 --> 00:22:54.473 line:95%,end
(interposing voices)

00:22:54.539 --> 00:22:56.274 line:95%,end
If by chance she wakes up
and it's blistered or something,

00:22:56.341 --> 00:22:57.309 line:95%,end
I'm not allowing her--

00:22:57.376 --> 00:22:59.845 line:95%,end
Nia's going to sneak into the room
tonight with a cigarette and go--

00:22:59.911 --> 00:23:01.513 line:95%,end
-(interposing voices)
-(laughs)

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:03.281 line:5%,start
I know Paige's feet are bothering her.

00:23:03.348 --> 00:23:06.885 line:95%,end
I just hope that Paige
would tell me if she couldn't dance.

00:23:06.952 --> 00:23:08.453 line:95%,end
How do your feet feel?

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:09.955 line:95%,end
They're okay.

00:23:10.021 --> 00:23:12.290 line:95%,end
They just hurt when I walk and I run.

00:23:12.357 --> 00:23:13.859 line:95%,end
ABBY: Okay, well,
don't walk and don't run.

00:23:15.627 --> 00:23:18.864 line:95%,end
DANCE MOM: Holly, is Nia able to do it?

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:22.200 line:95%,end
HOLLY: You know, I'm a nervous Nellie.
I always were. Like, can she pull it off?

00:23:22.267 --> 00:23:25.337 line:95%,end
<i>Nia has been running her solo</i>
<i>every free chance that she gets,</i>

00:23:25.404 --> 00:23:27.839 line:95%,end
but she's only had one chance
to run it with Abby,

00:23:27.906 --> 00:23:30.809 line:95%,end
and I'm really concerned
how well Nia's going to perform

00:23:30.876 --> 00:23:32.177 line:95%,end
during this competition.

00:23:32.244 --> 00:23:33.578 line:95%,end
It's not like she had
a lot of time to learn it,

00:23:33.645 --> 00:23:34.746 line:95%,end
so that's a lot of pressure.

00:23:34.813 --> 00:23:36.415 line:95%,end
I think she's prepared to do it,

00:23:36.481 --> 00:23:38.350 line:95%,end
but I think she's probably
also nervous at the same time.

00:23:39.251 --> 00:23:40.852 line:5%,start
(ball bouncing)

00:23:43.288 --> 00:23:44.322 line:95%,end
This is exciting.

00:23:44.389 --> 00:23:45.223 line:95%,end
I'm excited.

Kendall, she's going to dance

of the Harlem Globetrotters.

00:23:51.196 --> 00:23:53.231 line:5%,start
This is going to be
like a cheerleader dance,

00:23:53.298 --> 00:23:56.368 line:5%,start
and I think the crowd
will really appreciate her

00:23:56.435 --> 00:23:57.903 line:95%,end
for what she's going to bring to it.

00:23:59.004 --> 00:24:00.505 line:95%,end
She's about to go
on here in a second.

00:24:00.572 --> 00:24:01.540 line:95%,end
-Oh, okay.
-Oh, she is?

00:24:01.606 --> 00:24:03.375 line:95%,end
Let's go get you over to that corner.

00:24:03.442 --> 00:24:04.676 line:95%,end
-Thank you so much.
-All right, listen, Kendall. Kendall.

00:24:04.743 --> 00:24:06.745 line:95%,end
You can do this, okay?
-Okay.

00:24:06.812 --> 00:24:08.447 line:95%,end
You're going to be spectacular for me.

00:24:08.513 --> 00:24:09.915 line:95%,end
-Okay.
-This is great for us.

00:24:09.981 --> 00:24:11.683 line:95%,end
Candy Apples and Kendall, we might

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:13.285 line:95%,end
have to take it on the road.

00:24:13.351 --> 00:24:14.286 line:95%,end
All right, do good.

This is the biggest thing
Kendall has ever done,

Even though these girls are on dance teams

they all go to dance class.

we're getting ready to dance,

I'd rather pull the number now,
when they take a break,

00:36:46.003 --> 00:36:47.872 line:95%,end
Take a deep breath before you go on.

00:36:47.939 --> 00:36:49.040 line:95%,end
I'll find a spot.

00:36:49.106 --> 00:36:52.243 line:95%,end
<i>What I found was the competition director</i>
<i>was amazing.</i>

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:54.445 line:95%,end
<i>She was very accommodating.</i>

00:36:54.512 --> 00:36:57.815 line:95%,end
Her heart bled for Nia and she allowed her
to do this dance again,

00:36:57.882 --> 00:36:58.849 line:95%,end
and I was thrilled.

00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:07.058 line:95%,end
I knew when she got off the stage,

00:37:07.124 --> 00:37:09.694 line:95%,end
she was going to be mortified,
but most importantly,

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:12.096 line:95%,end
she wasn't be afraid of Abby's reaction.

00:37:18.269 --> 00:37:19.804 line:95%,end
I heard you're going to dance again.

00:37:21.005 --> 00:37:22.873 line:95%,end
You know when you dance again,

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:25.543 line:95%,end
you have to be 1,000 times
better than the first time.

00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:29.614 line:5%,start
For me, it's not just about
this routine on this day.

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:32.850 line:95%,end
This is a life lesson
that we all need to learn.

00:37:32.917 --> 00:37:35.920 line:95%,end
<i>I am preparing Nia for the future,</i>

00:37:35.987 --> 00:37:38.456 line:95%,end
and a future in this business is tough.

00:37:38.522 --> 00:37:40.291 line:95%,end
<i>You don't get a second chance.</i>

00:37:41.759 --> 00:37:45.162 line:95%,end
ANNOUNCER: <i>And taking the stage</i>
<i>for a second time, we have Nia.</i>

You did it.

<i>I'm happy for Nia.</i>

00:38:41.786 --> 00:38:44.689 line:95%,end
She had the courage to face the audience,

00:38:44.755 --> 00:38:47.792 line:95%,end
and she performed
with a smile, with energy.

00:38:48.926 --> 00:38:51.395 line:95%,end
She proved herself that she could do it.

00:38:51.462 --> 00:38:54.799 line:5%,start

00:38:57.535 --> 00:39:00.905 line:95%,end

ABBY: Even after the week that kid's had,

00:39:14.018 --> 00:39:16.587 line:95%,end
<i>Nia acted like a responsible dancer.</i>

00:39:16.654 --> 00:39:19.590 line:95%,end
<i>If you fall off the bike,</i>
<i>you need to get right back on it.</i>

00:39:19.657 --> 00:39:20.658 line:95%,end
Good for her.

00:39:20.725 --> 00:39:22.259 line:95%,end
That was good, Holly.

00:39:22.326 --> 00:39:24.862 line:95%,end

Nia came back. You placed. That was good.

00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:11.675 line:5%,start
Think about what you can do better

00:40:11.742 --> 00:40:14.612 line:5%,start
so that that never happens again,
and maybe place higher.

00:40:14.678 --> 00:40:15.679 line:5%,start

You guys seem tired.

You're in Miami.

This place--the clubs
don't even open till midnight.

00:40:25.489 --> 00:40:26.590 line:5%,start
Come on.
