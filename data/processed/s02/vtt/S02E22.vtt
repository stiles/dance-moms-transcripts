I made a mistake going to Candy Apples,

and I would really like for you

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:08.475 line:5%,start
to find a spot for Kendall.

-Exactly.

Starbound--ooh, that's pretty.

00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:23.690 line:5%,start

I am because I think you know better.

If you are going to continue to stand

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:51.418 line:5%,start
like a three-year-old with that sway back,

Today?

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.922 line:95%,end
I think it's more serious than just a toe.

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:30.490 line:95%,end
She said it's really swollen.

PAIGE: Can I try it, Miss Abby?

00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:39.532 line:95%,end

I told her not to fool around.

00:01:46.806 --> 00:01:48.675 line:95%,end
Kids, do you understand

00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:50.810 line:95%,end
that your body is your instrument,

00:01:50.877 --> 00:01:52.345 line:95%,end
that you need to take care of it?

00:01:52.412 --> 00:01:53.780 line:95%,end
And I said, girls, don't fool around.

00:01:53.847 --> 00:01:55.615 line:95%,end
There's cement underneath this carpeting.

00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:57.484 line:95%,end

CHRISTI: <i>It was an accident.</i>

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:00.987 line:5%,start
Most people would just take it

00:02:01.054 --> 00:02:02.288 line:5%,start
for what it is, an accident,

00:02:02.355 --> 00:02:03.756 line:5%,start
and not blame someone.

00:02:03.823 --> 00:02:05.592 line:95%,end
But Abby is all about the blame.

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.093 line:95%,end
Where's Jill?

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.930 line:95%,end
ABBY: Jill is not an official member
of this competition team.

00:02:10.997 --> 00:02:12.098 line:95%,end
She would like to think so.

00:02:12.165 --> 00:02:13.900 line:95%,end
But I may forgive people,

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:15.168 line:95%,end
but I don't forget.

00:02:15.235 --> 00:02:18.304 line:95%,end
So congratulations are in order.

00:02:18.371 --> 00:02:20.773 line:95%,end
We had an amazing trip to Lancaster.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.143 line:95%,end
I entered three solos in the competition

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.345 line:95%,end

I mean, come on, ladies.

00:02:44.063 --> 00:02:45.598 line:95%,end
This is important.

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:46.900 line:95%,end
Let's start with the pyramid.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.334 line:95%,end
On the bottom,

00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:50.537 line:95%,end
we have Paige.

00:02:50.603 --> 00:02:52.272 line:95%,end
Paige had an outstanding performance.

00:02:52.338 --> 00:02:54.574 line:95%,end
She was sixth overall high score.

00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:56.709 line:95%,end
SINGER: <i>âªYou've got to know how âª</i>

-(cheers and applause)

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.149 line:95%,end
ABBY: And then accidents happened.

00:03:03.216 --> 00:03:04.751 line:95%,end
She might be out a week

00:03:04.817 --> 00:03:07.253 line:95%,end
or maybe she'll be able to dance today.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.154 line:95%,end
Moving on.

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:10.590 line:95%,end
Mackenzie.

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:12.825 line:95%,end

you're there to learn.

00:03:14.961 --> 00:03:16.429 line:95%,end
And next,

00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:17.697 line:95%,end
I have Chloe.

00:03:17.764 --> 00:03:19.632 line:95%,end
Chloe, you did a great job.

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:21.234 line:95%,end
You didn't have a solo or a duet,

00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:22.902 line:95%,end
so it's a little difficult to judge.

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:24.604 line:95%,end
But you did a great job

00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:25.705 line:95%,end
in the group dance.

00:03:26.573 --> 00:03:27.540 line:95%,end
And next,

Brooke.

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:31.578 line:95%,end
Brooke, because of your maturity

00:03:31.644 --> 00:03:33.379 line:95%,end
during rehearsal all week

00:03:33.446 --> 00:03:34.414 line:95%,end
is why you're up there.

00:03:35.181 --> 00:03:37.450 line:95%,end
And second on the pyramid

00:03:37.517 --> 00:03:38.718 line:95%,end
is Nia.

00:03:38.785 --> 00:03:41.020 line:95%,end

00:03:47.961 --> 00:03:48.795 line:95%,end
is Maddie.

00:03:49.395 --> 00:03:50.797 line:95%,end
Maddie, you're there

00:03:50.863 --> 00:03:53.499 line:95%,end
because you beat everybody else there.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.202 line:95%,end
You were the highest score
the judges gave out.

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:57.770 line:95%,end

in the group dance

00:04:07.513 --> 00:04:08.648 line:95%,end
except Mackenzie.

00:04:09.148 --> 00:04:11.150 line:95%,end
Mackenzie, you have a solo.

00:04:11.217 --> 00:04:13.119 line:95%,end
Maddie, you will also be doing a solo.

GIRL: Ooh.

BROOKE: <i>I know who Anne Frank is,</i>

what her story has to do with dancing.

Chloe...

This is the week.

Chloe and Paige have been begging Abby

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:38.311 line:95%,end

00:04:38.378 --> 00:04:41.047 line:95%,end
<i>I really hope</i>

Go ahead and go.

You guys get the ballet bar out.

00:05:56.522 --> 00:05:57.890 line:95%,end
Oh, Paige.

00:05:58.725 --> 00:06:00.626 line:95%,end
PAIGE: <i>I'm really sad</i>
<i>that I broke my foot.</i>

00:06:00.693 --> 00:06:02.195 line:5%,start
But I'm even more sad

00:06:02.261 --> 00:06:04.797 line:5%,start
that I'm not going to be able
to do a duet with Chloe.

00:06:04.864 --> 00:06:07.066 line:95%,end
<i>We've been waiting a long time</i>
<i>to dance together,</i>

00:06:07.133 --> 00:06:09.001 line:95%,end
<i>and now we have to wait even longer.</i>

00:06:09.068 --> 00:06:10.603 line:95%,end
I don't want to fight with you, Kelly,

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.739 line:95%,end
but I think it's important
that she learn, just the same.

00:06:12.805 --> 00:06:14.340 line:95%,end
I think she should be in here
with a notebook.

00:06:14.407 --> 00:06:16.976 line:95%,end
If she's part of the team
she should be here.

00:06:17.043 --> 00:06:19.112 line:95%,end
<i>Paige is out for four to six weeks.</i>

00:06:19.178 --> 00:06:22.014 line:95%,end
I have no idea how this is going
to help us for Nationals,

00:06:22.081 --> 00:06:23.683 line:95%,end
<i>having one member of your team down.</i>

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:24.784 line:95%,end
<i>But you know what?</i>

00:06:24.851 --> 00:06:26.185 line:95%,end
The show must go on.

00:06:26.252 --> 00:06:27.687 line:95%,end
Aw.

00:06:27.754 --> 00:06:28.888 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Hey.

00:06:28.955 --> 00:06:31.023 line:95%,end
-My baby is broken.
-CHRISTI: Aw.

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:32.658 line:95%,end
I cannot believe she broke her foot.

00:06:32.725 --> 00:06:35.061 line:95%,end
Abby said, "Oh, well that's a bummer.

00:06:35.128 --> 00:06:37.430 line:95%,end
Because you finally got your duet
with Chloe."

00:06:37.497 --> 00:06:39.465 line:95%,end
-Uh-huh.
-I think that upset her.

00:06:39.532 --> 00:06:41.968 line:95%,end
Here, 2, 3, 4--

00:06:42.034 --> 00:06:43.603 line:95%,end
I think Brooke's hip hurts.

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.272 line:95%,end
Yeah. Brooke's back and hip

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:47.640 line:95%,end
definitely are hurting.

00:06:47.707 --> 00:06:49.776 line:95%,end
<i>I'm watching Brooke</i>
<i>during group rehearsals</i>

00:06:49.842 --> 00:06:51.477 line:5%,start
and I see her holding her back.

00:06:51.544 --> 00:06:53.279 line:5%,start
And I could just tell by her face

00:06:53.346 --> 00:06:54.280 line:95%,end
that she's in pain.

00:06:54.347 --> 00:06:56.215 line:95%,end
<i>Her solo this week is an acro number.</i>

00:06:56.282 --> 00:06:57.683 line:95%,end
<i>And if her back's bothering her,</i>

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.118 line:95%,end
<i>I don't know how she's going to do it.</i>

00:06:59.185 --> 00:07:01.654 line:95%,end
At Brooks age,
most people stop doing acro.

00:07:01.721 --> 00:07:03.222 line:95%,end
Your body just...

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:04.357 line:95%,end
-CHRISTI: Doesn't bend that way.
-...doesn't go.

00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:06.159 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: What do you think
Abby's body tells her?

00:07:06.225 --> 00:07:07.527 line:95%,end
-Stop eating?
-KELLY: Stop eating!

00:07:10.496 --> 00:07:12.999 line:5%,start
Kendall and I were not invited
to the pyramid

00:07:13.065 --> 00:07:15.001 line:5%,start
because Abby still refuses

00:07:15.067 --> 00:07:16.569 line:5%,start
to put Kendall on the team.

00:07:16.636 --> 00:07:19.172 line:95%,end
<i>We're here strictly to take dance classes.</i>

00:07:19.238 --> 00:07:20.740 line:95%,end
<i>I just need to be patient</i>

00:07:20.807 --> 00:07:22.141 line:95%,end
and wait for an opportunity

00:07:22.208 --> 00:07:26.179 line:95%,end
to present itself.

00:07:26.245 --> 00:07:27.914 line:95%,end
-Hi, Paige.
-Hi, Paigey.

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.316 line:95%,end
-What happened to your foot?
-JILL: How are you?

00:07:30.383 --> 00:07:31.551 line:95%,end
What happened?

00:07:31.617 --> 00:07:32.452 line:95%,end
PAIGE: It's broke.

00:07:32.518 --> 00:07:33.753 line:95%,end
JILL: How long are you out for?

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.121 line:95%,end
PAIGE: Four to six weeks.


00:07:35.188 --> 00:07:36.722 line:95%,end
Four to six weeks?

00:07:37.123 --> 00:07:38.324 line:95%,end
Aw, I'm sorry, honey.

00:07:38.391 --> 00:07:40.092 line:95%,end
Right at summertime. You go in.

00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:41.727 line:95%,end
Kendall, what do you say to Paige?

00:07:42.662 --> 00:07:43.930 line:95%,end
KENDALL: Good luck. (chuckles)

00:07:43.996 --> 00:07:46.165 line:5%,start
I really feel bad that Paige is injured.

00:07:46.232 --> 00:07:48.034 line:5%,start
But maybe I could fill in for her

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:49.669 line:5%,start
and maybe Abby could just

00:07:49.735 --> 00:07:51.137 line:95%,end
<i>let me be on the team.</i>

00:07:51.604 --> 00:07:53.573 line:95%,end
So you weren't in here for pyramid?

00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:55.007 line:95%,end
No. I was at the doctor's.

00:07:55.074 --> 00:07:56.542 line:95%,end
You don't know what--who's on top, what--

00:07:56.609 --> 00:07:58.478 line:95%,end
-what's going down this week?
-PAIGE: Uh-uh.

00:07:58.544 --> 00:08:00.446 line:95%,end
Me and Chloe were supposed
to have our duet.

00:08:00.513 --> 00:08:03.149 line:95%,end
So Abby told you, you had a duet this week

00:08:03.216 --> 00:08:04.484 line:95%,end
and now you can't dance it?

00:08:05.051 --> 00:08:07.553 line:95%,end
Aw. Did she tell you
who's going to be in it, instead?

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.689 line:95%,end
She said that Chloe might be doing a solo.

00:08:09.755 --> 00:08:11.357 line:95%,end
Aw. That's all right.

00:08:11.424 --> 00:08:13.326 line:95%,end
There'll be other duets in your future.

00:08:13.793 --> 00:08:15.361 line:95%,end
<i>It happens all the time</i>

00:08:15.428 --> 00:08:16.996 line:95%,end
on dance teams,

00:08:17.063 --> 00:08:18.130 line:95%,end
<i>unfortunate for Paige,</i>

00:08:18.197 --> 00:08:19.899 line:95%,end
fortunate for Kendall.

00:08:19.966 --> 00:08:21.968 line:95%,end
KELLY: Hi, Paigey Mac!

00:08:22.034 --> 00:08:23.102 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Hello!

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:24.003 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Hi, pumpkin.

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:26.205 line:95%,end
-Did you learn anything in there?
-PAIGE: Uh-uh.

00:08:26.272 --> 00:08:27.607 line:95%,end
-HOLLY: You taking notes?
-What did you write in your book?

00:08:27.673 --> 00:08:28.674 line:95%,end
Nothing.

00:08:28.741 --> 00:08:29.976 line:95%,end
Jill's here.

00:08:30.042 --> 00:08:31.010 line:95%,end
KELLY: Oh what was she doing?

00:08:31.077 --> 00:08:32.879 line:95%,end
Asking questions about this weekend.

00:08:32.945 --> 00:08:35.114 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>Why are she asking</i>
<i>what happened at pyramid?</i>

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:36.883 line:95%,end
Like, Jill, you're not part of the group.

00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:37.950 line:95%,end
Get it through your head.

00:08:38.017 --> 00:08:39.185 line:95%,end
You're not part of our group.

00:08:39.252 --> 00:08:41.587 line:95%,end
It doesn't matter
what happened at pyramid.

00:08:41.654 --> 00:08:44.290 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:08:45.791 --> 00:08:46.859 line:95%,end
Abby...

00:08:46.926 --> 00:08:48.461 line:95%,end
so Paige broke her foot?

00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:50.062 line:95%,end
Well, she didn't break her foot.

00:08:50.429 --> 00:08:52.899 line:95%,end
She broke her toe up into her foot.

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:55.001 line:95%,end
I wish I could hear what was going on.

00:08:55.067 --> 00:08:55.902 line:95%,end
I know.

00:08:55.968 --> 00:08:57.270 line:95%,end
So what now with Paige out?

00:08:57.336 --> 00:08:59.438 line:95%,end
She told me she's out
for four to six weeks.

00:08:59.505 --> 00:09:01.107 line:95%,end
That has nothing to do with you.

00:09:01.173 --> 00:09:03.309 line:95%,end
Well, I understand not me, personally,

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:04.877 line:95%,end
and that's very unfortunate.

00:09:04.944 --> 00:09:07.313 line:95%,end
But maybe now is there a spot for Kendall?

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.215 line:95%,end
Oh, my God. She's like--

00:09:09.282 --> 00:09:10.783 line:95%,end
she can sniff out an opening.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:13.419 line:95%,end
She must have smelled Paige's
broken foot from a mile away.

00:09:13.486 --> 00:09:14.320 line:95%,end
She's like... (sniffs)

00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:16.322 line:95%,end
...there's a spot on the pyramid
for Kendall!

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:17.990 line:95%,end
I'm the last person to ever

00:09:18.057 --> 00:09:19.892 line:95%,end
take Abby's side in anything.

00:09:19.959 --> 00:09:21.994 line:95%,end
But in the case of Jill versus Abby,

00:09:22.061 --> 00:09:23.129 line:95%,end
Abby wins.

00:09:23.195 --> 00:09:25.131 line:95%,end
Jill, you have to understand

00:09:25.197 --> 00:09:27.133 line:95%,end
that when you left

00:09:27.199 --> 00:09:28.734 line:95%,end
you didn't just disappear.

00:09:29.268 --> 00:09:31.637 line:95%,end
You went to this arch rival enemy.

00:09:31.704 --> 00:09:33.039 line:95%,end
Abby, we've been over this.

00:09:33.105 --> 00:09:36.208 line:95%,end
-I know.
-And it's very hurtful

00:09:36.275 --> 00:09:39.245 line:95%,end
and also just a slap in the face.

00:09:39.312 --> 00:09:40.646 line:95%,end
I was very hurt

00:09:40.713 --> 00:09:41.948 line:95%,end
by the way you treated Kendall.

00:09:42.014 --> 00:09:43.583 line:95%,end
-You can't be--
-You didn't let me do my job.

00:09:43.649 --> 00:09:44.850 line:95%,end
I want Kendall in the group.

00:09:44.917 --> 00:09:46.085 line:95%,end
I want Kendall in a duet.

00:09:46.152 --> 00:09:47.420 line:95%,end
<i>Really, lady?</i>

00:09:47.486 --> 00:09:49.755 line:95%,end
Did you not learn anything
the first time around?

00:09:49.822 --> 00:09:52.425 line:95%,end
You need to realize your place.

00:09:52.925 --> 00:09:54.594 line:95%,end
And you don't walk into a rehearsal.

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:56.028 line:95%,end
You don't walk into pyramid.

00:09:56.095 --> 00:09:57.997 line:95%,end
You don't throw your kid at people.

00:09:58.064 --> 00:09:59.732 line:95%,end
I need to do what's best for Kendall.

00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:01.534 line:95%,end
I need to do what's best for the group.

00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:03.369 line:95%,end
-Don't you think Kendall deserves...
-You have to understand that.

00:10:03.436 --> 00:10:05.504 line:95%,end
-...to be in that group?
-Kendall deserves nothing.

00:10:05.571 --> 00:10:07.607 line:95%,end
-It's not like you're all entitled.
-JILL: Abby, do you want her to dance...

00:10:07.673 --> 00:10:09.175 line:95%,end
-ABBY: I want her to take class.
-JILL: ...dance here or not?

00:10:09.241 --> 00:10:10.443 line:95%,end
-ABBY: I want her to study.
-She's in class.

00:10:10.509 --> 00:10:12.445 line:95%,end
-ABBY: I want her to get better.
-She was in class last night, Abby.

00:10:12.511 --> 00:10:13.379 line:95%,end
ABBY: Uh-huh.

00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:15.448 line:95%,end
Let me tell you
who wasn't in class last night.

00:10:15.514 --> 00:10:17.116 line:95%,end
-Tell me.
-No Hyland kids.

00:10:18.184 --> 00:10:19.251 line:95%,end
No Chloe.

00:10:19.318 --> 00:10:20.453 line:95%,end
They don't come to class.

00:10:20.519 --> 00:10:21.887 line:95%,end
Kendall will come to class.

00:10:22.355 --> 00:10:24.090 line:95%,end
These moms who give me a hard time

00:10:24.156 --> 00:10:25.992 line:95%,end
for doing what's best for Kendall--

00:10:26.058 --> 00:10:27.760 line:95%,end
I know deep down inside

00:10:27.827 --> 00:10:29.629 line:95%,end
they would do the exact same thing.

00:10:29.695 --> 00:10:32.698 line:95%,end
I can't live with myself
that I took her away from here

00:10:32.765 --> 00:10:34.700 line:95%,end
and took that opportunity away from her.

00:10:34.767 --> 00:10:36.602 line:95%,end
So I really need you

00:10:36.669 --> 00:10:39.405 line:95%,end
and want you to give her another chance.

00:10:40.373 --> 00:10:42.742 line:95%,end
I'm sure she sees it
as a golden opportunity.

00:10:42.808 --> 00:10:45.344 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>I went downstairs</i>
<i>because I heard Jill talking to Abby</i>

00:10:45.411 --> 00:10:46.479 line:95%,end
<i>at the front desk.</i>

00:10:46.545 --> 00:10:48.080 line:95%,end
<i>And I just wanted to let Jill know</i>

00:10:48.147 --> 00:10:49.548 line:95%,end
Paige is not out of the group.

00:10:49.615 --> 00:10:51.651 line:95%,end
She's injured and will be back.

00:10:51.717 --> 00:10:54.387 line:95%,end
So if she's trying to get Kendall
to replace Paige,

00:10:54.453 --> 00:10:55.655 line:95%,end
it's not happening.

00:10:55.721 --> 00:10:57.957 line:95%,end
Why did you ask Paige
who was replacing her in the duet?

00:10:58.024 --> 00:10:58.858 line:95%,end
I didn't.

00:10:58.924 --> 00:11:00.326 line:95%,end
KELLY: Why would go to Paige

00:11:00.393 --> 00:11:01.661 line:95%,end
and not the moms

00:11:01.727 --> 00:11:03.062 line:95%,end
about what's going on this weekend

00:11:03.129 --> 00:11:05.231 line:95%,end
before you put your claws in to get--

00:11:05.297 --> 00:11:06.532 line:95%,end
I didn't know Paige was in there.

00:11:06.599 --> 00:11:08.601 line:95%,end
-I didn't go scouting out Paige.
-But you didn't--

00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:10.002 line:95%,end
I went in. She was sitting there

00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:11.337 line:95%,end
-with a broken foot.
-But you didn't come up to Paige...

00:11:11.404 --> 00:11:12.838 line:95%,end
I said, "Honey, how are you?

00:11:12.905 --> 00:11:14.707 line:95%,end
-What happened?"
-...and say, so what's going this weekend?

00:11:14.774 --> 00:11:16.676 line:95%,end
JILL: I really didn't do anything
inappropriate.

00:11:25.651 --> 00:11:26.485 line:95%,end
ABBY: Hey, guys.

00:11:26.552 --> 00:11:28.421 line:95%,end
Maddie has to fly out tomorrow

00:11:28.487 --> 00:11:30.322 line:95%,end
morning to do <i>Drop Dead Diva.</i>

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:32.391 line:95%,end
The group comes first.

00:11:32.458 --> 00:11:33.859 line:95%,end
Absolutely. I agree with you.

00:11:33.926 --> 00:11:35.161 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>A couple of weeks ago,</i>

00:11:35.227 --> 00:11:37.897 line:5%,start
Maddie auditioned for a role
on <i>Drop Dead Diva.</i>

00:11:37.963 --> 00:11:40.566 line:95%,end
<i>She got the part,</i>
<i>and I'm thrilled for her.</i>

00:11:40.633 --> 00:11:42.835 line:95%,end
<i>But we have a competition this weekend.</i>

00:11:42.902 --> 00:11:45.004 line:95%,end
Missing a day of rehearsals is huge.

00:11:45.071 --> 00:11:47.373 line:95%,end
I don't want you to get out on stage
this weekend in competition,

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.942 line:95%,end
and look like the yahoo
who doesn't know what they're doing.

00:11:50.443 --> 00:11:52.912 line:95%,end
This TV thing is a special event.

00:11:52.978 --> 00:11:55.548 line:95%,end
But I wish you were going to be here
tomorrow for rehearsal.

00:11:55.614 --> 00:11:57.983 line:95%,end
And that group dance better be perfect.

00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:59.418 line:95%,end
<i>When Maddie comes back,</i>

00:11:59.485 --> 00:12:01.253 line:95%,end
<i>she's going to have to play catch up.</i>

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:04.156 line:95%,end
She better not come back
as some Hollywood diva.

00:12:04.223 --> 00:12:06.759 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:12:06.826 --> 00:12:08.327 line:5%,start
And look,

00:12:08.794 --> 00:12:09.895 line:5%,start
hide it,

00:12:09.962 --> 00:12:11.297 line:5%,start
throw it.

00:12:11.363 --> 00:12:13.265 line:95%,end
It's all about the journal

00:12:13.332 --> 00:12:15.201 line:95%,end
and the diary of Anne Frank.

00:12:15.267 --> 00:12:17.136 line:95%,end
Brooke is doing a solo this week.

00:12:17.203 --> 00:12:18.871 line:5%,start
<i>It's about the Holocaust.</i>

00:12:18.938 --> 00:12:20.673 line:5%,start
I mean, this is serious for Brooke.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.442 line:95%,end
<i>I don't know if she has what it takes</i>
<i>to perform this number or not.</i>

00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:25.177 line:95%,end
(somber music playing)

00:12:25.244 --> 00:12:26.445 line:95%,end
Does anybody know anything

00:12:26.512 --> 00:12:28.114 line:95%,end
about this <i>Diary of Anne Frank?</i>

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:29.882 line:95%,end
Because I have no clue of the story.

00:12:31.283 --> 00:12:34.053 line:5%,start
I can't believe that Kelly
doesn't know who Anne Frank is.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.089 line:95%,end
<i>I mean, that's a standard part</i>
<i>of curriculum in middle school.</i>

00:12:38.224 --> 00:12:39.992 line:95%,end
You didn't have to read
the <i>Diary of Anne Frank?</i>

00:12:40.059 --> 00:12:41.093 line:95%,end
-No.
-ABBY: Cartwheel.

00:12:43.162 --> 00:12:44.296 line:95%,end
Easy. Easy.

00:12:44.363 --> 00:12:45.931 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>I don't really know much</i>
<i>about Anne Frank.</i>

00:12:45.998 --> 00:12:47.466 line:5%,start
But what I do know

00:12:47.533 --> 00:12:49.568 line:5%,start
is that I don't think
she was doing cartwheels.

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:52.638 line:95%,end
There's a lot that goes into this piece.

00:12:52.705 --> 00:12:54.673 line:95%,end
And I'm watching Brooke,

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:56.375 line:95%,end
<i>and she is just grimacing.</i>

00:12:56.442 --> 00:12:58.077 line:95%,end
Is she telling the story

00:12:58.144 --> 00:12:59.478 line:95%,end
or is she in pain?

00:12:59.545 --> 00:13:00.813 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>I don't think Brooke should dance.</i>

00:13:01.147 --> 00:13:02.615 line:95%,end
<i>I took Brooke to a chiropractor</i>

00:13:02.681 --> 00:13:05.217 line:95%,end
<i>and he thinks that Brooke needs to rest.</i>

00:13:05.284 --> 00:13:06.585 line:95%,end
And I totally agree.

00:13:06.652 --> 00:13:09.155 line:95%,end
<i>Why can't brook do a dance</i>

00:13:09.221 --> 00:13:11.123 line:95%,end
with no acrobatics in her dance?

00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:12.958 line:95%,end
ABBY: You only have three days, kiddo,

00:13:13.025 --> 00:13:15.427 line:95%,end
before you are onstage doing this number.

00:13:15.494 --> 00:13:16.962 line:95%,end
You're dismissed for right now.

00:13:17.029 --> 00:13:17.897 line:95%,end
Go ahead and rest that,

00:13:17.963 --> 00:13:20.065 line:95%,end
and then I want you back in here
to finish it up.

00:13:23.469 --> 00:13:24.904 line:95%,end
<i>Can you start down here?</i>

00:13:25.204 --> 00:13:26.705 line:95%,end
MACKENZIE: <i>I'm rehearsing my solo today</i>

00:13:26.772 --> 00:13:28.307 line:5%,start
and it's a really fun dance.

00:13:28.374 --> 00:13:29.875 line:5%,start
And it's called <i>You Know You Love It.</i>

00:13:29.942 --> 00:13:31.343 line:5%,start
I know I love it.

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:32.611 line:5%,start
(upbeat music playing)

00:13:32.678 --> 00:13:33.579 line:5%,start
SINGER: <i>âªYou know you love itâª</i>

00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:34.613 line:5%,start
ABBY: Faster, go.

00:13:35.514 --> 00:13:36.849 line:95%,end
SINGER: <i>âªYou know you love itâª</i>

00:13:37.516 --> 00:13:38.784 line:95%,end
<i>âªYou know you love itâª</i>

00:13:38.851 --> 00:13:40.619 line:95%,end
-And push away. Shoo!
-SINGER: <i>âªYou know you need itâª</i>

00:13:40.686 --> 00:13:42.221 line:95%,end
ABBY: Go, push!

00:13:42.721 --> 00:13:44.590 line:95%,end
<i>I think Mackenzie's dance is darling.</i>

00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:47.526 line:95%,end
The difficulty level is right up there.

00:13:47.593 --> 00:13:48.861 line:95%,end
Knee, ball change.

00:13:48.928 --> 00:13:51.130 line:95%,end
<i>ChainÃ©, </i>side aerial, two times.

00:13:51.197 --> 00:13:54.133 line:95%,end
<i>I think she's really improving</i>
<i>as a dancer,</i>

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.735 line:95%,end
as a performer and as an acrobat.

00:13:56.802 --> 00:13:58.771 line:95%,end
You need to get this choreography
in your head.

00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:00.639 line:95%,end
Go into the other room
and start working on it.

00:14:00.706 --> 00:14:02.141 line:95%,end
No tumbling!

00:14:03.909 --> 00:14:04.777 line:95%,end
Hi, guys.

00:14:05.244 --> 00:14:06.312 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>Oh, God.</i>

00:14:06.378 --> 00:14:07.580 line:5%,start
Here comes Jill.

00:14:07.646 --> 00:14:09.215 line:5%,start
She and Kendall aren't even on the team.

00:14:09.281 --> 00:14:10.716 line:95%,end
<i>But we know Jill well enough to know</i>

00:14:10.783 --> 00:14:12.218 line:95%,end
that the absence of an invitation

00:14:12.284 --> 00:14:14.119 line:95%,end
isn't going to stop her from showing up.

00:14:14.186 --> 00:14:15.387 line:5%,start
-Hi, Kendall!
-Hey!

00:14:15.454 --> 00:14:18.791 line:5%,start
ABBY: So, Kendall,
I'm looking for a replacement

00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:20.759 line:95%,end
for the duet for Paige.

00:14:20.826 --> 00:14:22.895 line:95%,end
Abby's having auditions for the duet,

00:14:22.962 --> 00:14:24.897 line:95%,end
which I think is absolutely ridiculous

00:14:24.964 --> 00:14:27.199 line:95%,end
considering Kendall's not on the team.

00:14:27.266 --> 00:14:28.200 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Kendall?


00:14:28.267 --> 00:14:29.869 line:95%,end
Oh, for the love of God.

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:32.338 line:95%,end
Maddie is not auditioning

00:14:32.404 --> 00:14:34.506 line:95%,end
because she has solo this week.

00:14:34.573 --> 00:14:36.976 line:95%,end
Let's have Chloe and Nia do it.

00:14:38.143 --> 00:14:41.146 line:95%,end
(dramatic music playing)

00:14:46.585 --> 00:14:47.720 line:95%,end
ABBY: Nia...

00:14:47.786 --> 00:14:49.488 line:95%,end
some things are great.

00:14:49.555 --> 00:14:52.324 line:95%,end
I just think that you don't look
that great with her.

00:14:52.391 --> 00:14:53.525 line:95%,end
Like, it's a little off.

00:14:53.592 --> 00:14:54.426 line:95%,end
It's a little quirky.

00:14:54.493 --> 00:14:57.630 line:95%,end
You don't dance exactly the same.

00:14:57.696 --> 00:14:59.365 line:95%,end
You dance very much different.

00:15:00.766 --> 00:15:02.534 line:95%,end
-All right, let me see you and Kendall.
-Okay.

00:15:03.102 --> 00:15:03.936 line:95%,end
ABBY: And, one...

00:15:08.407 --> 00:15:09.308 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I'm a little unclear.

00:15:09.375 --> 00:15:11.310 line:95%,end
Did Abby call you...

00:15:11.377 --> 00:15:12.478 line:95%,end
-JILL: No.
-...and say to come back?

00:15:12.544 --> 00:15:14.280 line:95%,end
No. She told me get--

00:15:14.346 --> 00:15:15.381 line:95%,end
get the kid in class.

00:15:15.447 --> 00:15:16.782 line:95%,end
So she's here, in class.

00:15:21.553 --> 00:15:22.922 line:95%,end
Do you think I went to Abby

00:15:22.988 --> 00:15:24.757 line:95%,end
and said put her in the duet?

00:15:24.823 --> 00:15:27.493 line:95%,end
If Abby does, it's because Abby
wanted her in there.

00:15:27.559 --> 00:15:28.394 line:95%,end
Why couldn't you say,

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:30.896 line:95%,end
"Wow, what a nice thing for Kendall
if she's selected?"

00:15:30.963 --> 00:15:32.164 line:95%,end
I don't think it's fair for her

00:15:32.231 --> 00:15:34.767 line:95%,end
-to be put in the duet. I don't.
-Because, Jill--again--

00:15:34.833 --> 00:15:36.702 line:95%,end
You guys are so selfish.

00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:38.537 line:95%,end
-I can't believe they're selfish.
-WOMEN: No.

00:15:38.604 --> 00:15:40.339 line:95%,end
-No. That's not being selfish.
-No. I think it's selfish for you

00:15:40.406 --> 00:15:43.042 line:95%,end
-to think she should be allowed.
-Really? I never said--

00:15:43.108 --> 00:15:44.910 line:95%,end
-That's selfish for you.
-I thought she should be allowed.

00:15:44.977 --> 00:15:46.445 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: You're saying, you know,

00:15:46.512 --> 00:15:48.080 line:95%,end
we should be pleased and happy for her.

00:15:48.147 --> 00:15:50.182 line:95%,end
But it's at the expense
of one of our children

00:15:50.249 --> 00:15:52.551 line:95%,end
who have sacrificed so much to be here.

00:15:52.618 --> 00:15:54.453 line:95%,end
-It's just another week.
-CHRISTI: They're already on the team.

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.689 line:95%,end
-It's just another number.
-You're not part of our team.

00:15:57.823 --> 00:15:59.425 line:5%,start
I take all their snide remarks

00:15:59.491 --> 00:16:00.492 line:5%,start
and all their bullying

00:16:00.559 --> 00:16:02.027 line:5%,start
and all their criticism.

00:16:02.094 --> 00:16:03.195 line:95%,end
But, you know what?

00:16:03.262 --> 00:16:05.230 line:95%,end
This is about a mother

00:16:05.297 --> 00:16:07.333 line:95%,end
doing what's best for her daughter.

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:09.702 line:95%,end
-Nia looks cute doing this dance.
-You need to say something

00:16:09.768 --> 00:16:11.203 line:95%,end
-if it's Kendall.
-Like, she looks perfectly fine.

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:12.671 line:95%,end
-And Holly--
-KELLY: Holly, you are marching

00:16:12.738 --> 00:16:13.605 line:95%,end
your butt down there,

00:16:13.672 --> 00:16:15.341 line:95%,end
if I have to push you down them steps.

00:16:15.407 --> 00:16:18.143 line:95%,end
My daughter has been there

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:20.079 line:95%,end
day in and day out.

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:23.983 line:95%,end
<i>I think a lot of Abby's practices</i>

00:16:24.049 --> 00:16:25.084 line:95%,end
<i>are unfair.</i>

00:16:26.618 --> 00:16:27.886 line:95%,end
What's going on with the duet, Abby?

00:16:27.953 --> 00:16:30.222 line:95%,end
Kendall was in class in the other room.

00:16:30.289 --> 00:16:31.223 line:95%,end
I went and got her.

00:16:32.458 --> 00:16:34.059 line:95%,end
Nia was doing it.

00:16:34.126 --> 00:16:36.395 line:95%,end
She was doing it well.
I gave her some corrections.

00:16:36.462 --> 00:16:39.298 line:95%,end
Kendall has been gone several weeks.

00:16:39.365 --> 00:16:40.799 line:95%,end
-ABBY: Right.
-HOLLY: She just came back.

00:16:40.866 --> 00:16:42.634 line:95%,end
My child has been here throughout.

00:16:43.736 --> 00:16:45.671 line:95%,end
ABBY: She may not be right for the duet.

00:16:45.738 --> 00:16:47.373 line:95%,end
-You know--
-She's never right for those special parts

00:16:47.439 --> 00:16:48.907 line:95%,end
unless she's lifting Mackenzie.

00:16:49.641 --> 00:16:51.377 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>Holly just doesn't understand.</i>

00:16:51.443 --> 00:16:54.480 line:95%,end
This is strictly
about my best chance at winning.

00:16:54.546 --> 00:16:55.614 line:95%,end
There are lots of things
that she could do.

00:16:55.681 --> 00:16:57.282 line:95%,end
Right. But they're not the duet music

00:16:57.349 --> 00:16:59.118 line:95%,end
-that I have this week.
-Well, why don't you find something?

00:16:59.184 --> 00:17:01.253 line:95%,end
-I agree with you.
-She could do something with the '60s.

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.689 line:95%,end
She could do something
with popping, locking.

00:17:03.756 --> 00:17:05.457 line:95%,end
She could do all sorts of
different things.

00:17:05.524 --> 00:17:07.359 line:95%,end
ABBY: I agree with you.
But, you know what?

00:17:07.426 --> 00:17:08.761 line:95%,end
It's a duet with Chloe.

00:17:08.827 --> 00:17:09.928 line:95%,end
That wasn't the plan.

00:17:09.995 --> 00:17:12.364 line:95%,end
I wasn't seeking music for Nia.

00:17:12.431 --> 00:17:14.800 line:95%,end
I was seeking music for Chloe.

00:17:14.867 --> 00:17:17.469 line:95%,end
No need to get all belligerent
and indignant with me.

00:17:17.536 --> 00:17:19.838 line:95%,end
I am, because I think you know better.

00:17:19.905 --> 00:17:21.106 line:95%,end
No. I think you look foolish.

00:17:22.141 --> 00:17:25.210 line:95%,end
This is strictly about
what's right for the duet,

00:17:25.277 --> 00:17:27.179 line:95%,end
<i>not about you want.</i>

00:17:27.246 --> 00:17:28.614 line:95%,end
Nia will get the duet

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:30.082 line:95%,end
only if I think

00:17:30.149 --> 00:17:31.950 line:95%,end
she's my best shot at winning.


00:17:35.921 --> 00:17:38.924 line:5%,start
(upbeat music playing)

00:17:42.261 --> 00:17:43.695 line:5%,start
Let's <i>ballottÃ©!</i>

00:17:45.397 --> 00:17:47.232 line:5%,start
<i>Changement!</i>

00:17:47.299 --> 00:17:48.667 line:95%,end
<i>Sissonne!</i>

00:17:48.734 --> 00:17:50.235 line:95%,end
<i>This week has been tough.</i>

00:17:50.302 --> 00:17:52.438 line:5%,start
Paige is out with a foot injury.

00:17:52.938 --> 00:17:55.541 line:95%,end
<i>Brooding Brooke is whining</i>
<i>about the back pain.</i>

00:17:55.941 --> 00:17:57.276 line:95%,end
And Maddie is away

00:17:57.342 --> 00:17:59.244 line:95%,end
doing a role for <i>Drop Dead Diva.</i>

00:17:59.578 --> 00:18:01.313 line:95%,end
<i>This group number is a mess,</i>

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:03.415 line:95%,end
<i>and it needs all the help we can get.</i>

00:18:03.982 --> 00:18:05.517 line:95%,end
<i>So I'm putting Kendall</i>

00:18:05.584 --> 00:18:07.186 line:95%,end
<i>in the group number.</i>

00:18:07.252 --> 00:18:08.887 line:95%,end
She's still not a member of this team,

00:18:08.954 --> 00:18:11.290 line:95%,end
<i>and I'm not sure</i>
<i>about the duet with Chloe yet.</i>

00:18:11.356 --> 00:18:13.392 line:95%,end
But at least if I put her
in the group number,

00:18:13.459 --> 00:18:15.661 line:95%,end
maybe Jill will get off my back.

00:18:15.727 --> 00:18:17.296 line:95%,end
Up, step,

00:18:17.362 --> 00:18:18.564 line:95%,end
leap onto it.

00:18:19.598 --> 00:18:23.135 line:95%,end
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8!

00:18:23.202 --> 00:18:25.537 line:95%,end
I think that with Abby knowing

00:18:25.604 --> 00:18:27.072 line:95%,end
Brooke's back is injured,

00:18:27.139 --> 00:18:30.709 line:95%,end
she would have made
the executive decision to say,

00:18:30.776 --> 00:18:32.544 line:95%,end
"You know what?
Brooke's going to do a dance this week

00:18:32.611 --> 00:18:35.314 line:95%,end
with no acro in it to let her back rest."

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:36.849 line:95%,end
Let someone else do a solo.

00:18:36.915 --> 00:18:38.183 line:95%,end
Give her back a break.

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:39.618 line:95%,end
Oh, Jill...

00:18:39.685 --> 00:18:41.687 line:95%,end
-are you volunteering?
-KELLY: Oh, for the love of God!

00:18:41.753 --> 00:18:43.889 line:95%,end
JILL: I'm just saying,
would that not make sense?

00:18:43.956 --> 00:18:47.126 line:95%,end
Give the kid a break
There's other kids not dancing solos.

00:18:47.192 --> 00:18:48.760 line:95%,end
You know, I think it's kind of funny

00:18:48.827 --> 00:18:50.229 line:95%,end
that wherever you go,

00:18:50.295 --> 00:18:52.698 line:95%,end
someone mysteriously, like, breaks a foot.

00:18:54.032 --> 00:18:55.467 line:5%,start
These moms can laugh at me

00:18:55.534 --> 00:18:57.636 line:5%,start
and make all the snippy comments
that they want.

00:18:57.703 --> 00:18:59.571 line:95%,end
<i>But I'm not going to let them stop me</i>

00:18:59.638 --> 00:19:01.473 line:95%,end
on getting Kendall back on this team.

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.175 line:95%,end
ABBY: All right, ladies, we have two days.

00:19:03.242 --> 00:19:05.277 line:95%,end
I don't know.
Does this dance have what it takes?

00:19:06.145 --> 00:19:06.979 line:95%,end
I don't think so.

00:19:07.045 --> 00:19:09.248 line:95%,end
You have to get into it.
You need to be fabulous.

00:19:09.314 --> 00:19:10.482 line:95%,end
Let's go.

00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:11.483 line:95%,end
Two days!

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:13.085 line:95%,end
<i>They're still late.</i>

00:19:13.152 --> 00:19:14.453 line:95%,end
They're still sloppy.

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.688 line:95%,end
Their shoulders are still up.

00:19:16.755 --> 00:19:18.090 line:95%,end
Their elbows are dropping.

00:19:18.157 --> 00:19:19.625 line:95%,end
I mean, girls, come on.

00:19:20.759 --> 00:19:22.060 line:95%,end
So where is Maddie?

00:19:22.127 --> 00:19:24.096 line:95%,end
KELLY: Well, Maddie is doing
that <i>Drop Dead Diva</i> thing.

00:19:24.163 --> 00:19:25.364 line:95%,end
This is a professional job.

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:27.199 line:95%,end
Does she get paid for it?

00:19:27.266 --> 00:19:30.102 line:95%,end
I think when Melissa comes back
she'll be very hush-hush about it.

00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:31.637 line:95%,end
-But she'll want us to ask.
-CHRISTI: Right.

00:19:31.703 --> 00:19:33.038 line:95%,end
But I don't think she'll want to reveal

00:19:33.105 --> 00:19:34.373 line:95%,end
-too, too much.
-JILL: Hmm.

00:19:35.774 --> 00:19:39.211 line:5%,start
(upbeat music playing)

00:19:39.278 --> 00:19:40.412 line:95%,end
MELISSA: <i>Maddie and I are getting ready</i>

00:19:40.479 --> 00:19:42.514 line:95%,end
to film <i>Drop Dead Diva.</i>

00:19:42.948 --> 00:19:44.816 line:95%,end
<i>We're on the way</i>
<i>to the sound stage right now,</i>

00:19:44.883 --> 00:19:46.351 line:95%,end
<i>and we're so excited.</i>

00:19:46.418 --> 00:19:48.487 line:5%,start
I just know she's going to nail
her acting performance,

00:19:48.554 --> 00:19:50.022 line:5%,start
just like she does in dancing.

00:19:51.089 --> 00:19:51.924 line:5%,start
MAN: On your mark.

00:19:52.791 --> 00:19:54.760 line:5%,start
I'm really excited
to be shooting my scenes

00:19:54.826 --> 00:19:55.961 line:5%,start
for <i>Drop Dead Diva.</i>

00:19:56.295 --> 00:19:58.764 line:95%,end
<i>They had me do a lot</i>
<i>of takes over and over,</i>

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:00.098 line:95%,end
<i>and I actually like that</i>

00:20:00.165 --> 00:20:03.135 line:95%,end
because I like to do everything perfect.

00:20:03.202 --> 00:20:04.903 line:95%,end
I can't do it!

00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:07.472 line:95%,end
And it was really fun to see Maddie
get into her character.

00:20:07.539 --> 00:20:08.574 line:95%,end
<i>I'm really happy for her,</i>

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.542 line:95%,end
but it's too bad that the other girls
and moms

00:20:10.609 --> 00:20:12.511 line:95%,end
can't be here, as well.

00:20:12.578 --> 00:20:16.448 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:20:19.518 --> 00:20:21.220 line:5%,start
ABBY: Arms!

00:20:23.255 --> 00:20:24.556 line:95%,end
<i>I need to make a decision</i>

00:20:24.623 --> 00:20:27.025 line:95%,end
<i>on who's doing this duet with Chloe.</i>

00:20:27.526 --> 00:20:29.695 line:95%,end
I have Brooke,
who's in pain with her back.

00:20:29.761 --> 00:20:31.230 line:95%,end
<i>Nia works hard,</i>

00:20:31.296 --> 00:20:33.265 line:95%,end
<i>but she doesn't really fit in with Chloe.</i>


00:20:33.799 --> 00:20:35.834 line:95%,end
So, by process of elimination,

00:20:35.901 --> 00:20:37.035 line:95%,end
it's got to be Kendall.

00:20:37.102 --> 00:20:38.637 line:95%,end
Kendall, you're in the duet.

00:20:38.704 --> 00:20:39.972 line:95%,end
(soft piano music playing)

00:20:40.038 --> 00:20:42.708 line:95%,end
KENDALL: <i>I'm really excited</i>
<i>to do a duet with Chloe.</i>

00:20:42.774 --> 00:20:44.209 line:5%,start
And I'm really happy

00:20:44.276 --> 00:20:46.211 line:5%,start
because this is my comeback.

00:20:46.278 --> 00:20:49.615 line:5%,start
And maybe Abby can see that
I really can be on the team.

00:20:49.681 --> 00:20:51.984 line:95%,end
I don't think it's good enough.
It's not going to win.

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:54.119 line:95%,end
You have two days to pull it together.

00:20:54.953 --> 00:20:56.355 line:95%,end
Two days.

00:20:56.421 --> 00:20:58.423 line:95%,end
-Go.
-Okay. Thank you.

00:20:58.490 --> 00:20:59.825 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>I don't want to deal with Jill.</i>

00:20:59.891 --> 00:21:02.261 line:95%,end
I don't want 50 million questions.

00:21:02.327 --> 00:21:03.562 line:95%,end
<i>Drop your kid off,</i>

00:21:03.629 --> 00:21:05.130 line:95%,end
<i>let her learn this duet.</i>

00:21:05.197 --> 00:21:06.865 line:95%,end
That's it. That's all I want.

00:21:09.201 --> 00:21:10.335 line:95%,end
-Hi, Mom.
-JILL: Hi, love.

00:21:10.402 --> 00:21:11.436 line:95%,end
How are you, baby?

00:21:11.503 --> 00:21:12.471 line:95%,end
What's going on?

00:21:12.537 --> 00:21:14.806 line:95%,end
Abby said that I was definitely
in the duo.

00:21:14.873 --> 00:21:16.842 line:95%,end
-Wait. She did?
-Yeah.

00:21:16.908 --> 00:21:18.210 line:95%,end
JILL: That's great!

00:21:18.277 --> 00:21:19.711 line:95%,end
-Aren't you excited?
-KENDALL: Yeah.

00:21:19.778 --> 00:21:21.246 line:95%,end
I'm so excited!

00:21:21.313 --> 00:21:22.514 line:95%,end
So the moms were annoyed.

00:21:22.581 --> 00:21:23.682 line:95%,end
But, guess what?

00:21:23.749 --> 00:21:24.716 line:95%,end
I don't care.

00:21:24.783 --> 00:21:26.585 line:95%,end
<i>This is a good opportunity for Kendall</i>

00:21:26.652 --> 00:21:28.453 line:95%,end
<i>to bring her out of her shell</i>

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.622 line:95%,end
and get her back on her road to success.

00:21:31.923 --> 00:21:34.726 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:21:35.894 --> 00:21:37.763 line:95%,end
ABBY: Hello.

00:21:37.829 --> 00:21:39.131 line:95%,end
-How was it?
-It's great.

00:21:39.197 --> 00:21:40.299 line:95%,end
Tell me about it.

00:21:40.365 --> 00:21:41.533 line:95%,end
I did two scenes

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.535 line:95%,end
and I did a solo

00:21:43.602 --> 00:21:44.503 line:95%,end
on this fake stage.

00:21:44.569 --> 00:21:46.305 line:95%,end
And then I did a dance scene

00:21:46.371 --> 00:21:47.673 line:95%,end
at the studio.

00:21:47.739 --> 00:21:50.208 line:95%,end
How was your dancing?
Did anybody say anything?

00:21:50.275 --> 00:21:51.343 line:95%,end
Were they impressed?

00:21:51.743 --> 00:21:53.045 line:95%,end
MELISSA: After she was all finished,

00:21:53.111 --> 00:21:54.413 line:95%,end
they stood up and clapped for her.

00:21:54.479 --> 00:21:55.914 line:95%,end
-And it was--
-Oh...

00:21:55.981 --> 00:21:57.582 line:95%,end
a standing ovation.

00:21:57.649 --> 00:21:58.550 line:95%,end
What did you learn?

00:21:58.617 --> 00:22:01.119 line:95%,end
I need to learn how to use my emotion

00:22:01.186 --> 00:22:02.421 line:95%,end
when I act more.

00:22:02.487 --> 00:22:04.589 line:95%,end
So when you're saying the lines
you need to emote,

00:22:04.656 --> 00:22:06.058 line:95%,end
just like you do when you're dancing.

00:22:06.124 --> 00:22:06.958 line:95%,end
Yes?

00:22:07.025 --> 00:22:08.760 line:95%,end
I had a lot of fun on the TV show,

00:22:08.827 --> 00:22:11.129 line:95%,end
but now I have to get ready
for competition.

00:22:12.097 --> 00:22:14.566 line:5%,start
So you worked on this number
while you were doing <i>Drop Dead Diva?</i>

00:22:15.634 --> 00:22:16.635 line:95%,end
You did it?

00:22:17.102 --> 00:22:19.304 line:95%,end
MELISSA: <i>Maddie's kind of</i>
<i>like a little machine.</i>

00:22:19.371 --> 00:22:21.340 line:95%,end
When she wasn't rehearsing
for <i>Drop Dead Diva,</i>

00:22:21.406 --> 00:22:22.741 line:95%,end
she was in the hallway running

00:22:22.808 --> 00:22:25.410 line:95%,end
<i>her solo and also the group dance.</i>

00:22:25.477 --> 00:22:26.745 line:95%,end
JILL: <i>I'm glad you're back.</i>

00:22:26.812 --> 00:22:27.846 line:95%,end
It was definitely fun

00:22:27.913 --> 00:22:29.348 line:95%,end
and a really great experience.

00:22:30.148 --> 00:22:32.117 line:95%,end
But it's good for our kids
to know there is life

00:22:32.184 --> 00:22:33.919 line:95%,end
after Abby Lee Miller

00:22:33.985 --> 00:22:35.654 line:95%,end
-and outside of here.
-HOLLY: Exactly.

00:22:36.822 --> 00:22:39.825 line:5%,start
(soft dramatic music playing)

00:22:44.596 --> 00:22:49.234 line:95%,end
SINGER: <i>âªI just had another dreamâª</i>

00:22:49.301 --> 00:22:50.769 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>This routine is called</i>

00:22:50.836 --> 00:22:52.738 line:95%,end
This is Me, Over You.

00:22:52.804 --> 00:22:55.841 line:95%,end
<i>This music is definitely</i>
<i>a subtle note to Maddie.</i>

00:22:55.907 --> 00:22:57.509 line:95%,end
She is the one with the power.

00:22:57.576 --> 00:22:58.643 line:95%,end
Use it, kid.

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:01.079 line:95%,end
One, push. Two, push, Three, push.

00:23:01.146 --> 00:23:03.715 line:95%,end
Four, push. Sweep, sweep. Shoo!

00:23:03.782 --> 00:23:06.151 line:95%,end
MADDIE: <i>I have a solo and a group number.</i>

00:23:06.218 --> 00:23:08.153 line:95%,end
I also missed a day of rehearsal.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.722 line:95%,end
<i>I need to work extra hard today.</i>

00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:12.624 line:95%,end
ABBY: Smile! Change your face.

00:23:13.425 --> 00:23:15.127 line:95%,end
She looked like she forgot a little part.

00:23:15.727 --> 00:23:16.795 line:95%,end
ABBY: Shoulders, relax.

00:23:16.862 --> 00:23:18.663 line:95%,end
Don't sit down. Don't sit down!

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:20.031 line:95%,end
<i>I'm rehearsing Maddie's solo,</i>

00:23:20.098 --> 00:23:21.199 line:95%,end
<i>and I can tell...</i>

00:23:21.266 --> 00:23:22.768 line:95%,end
she's just not there yet.

00:23:22.834 --> 00:23:25.003 line:95%,end
<i>That one day of missing rehearsal</i>

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:26.905 line:95%,end
<i>has really set her back.</i>

00:23:26.972 --> 00:23:29.641 line:95%,end
She needs to be ready
for competition tomorrow.

What is that for?

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:23.888 line:95%,end
For Brooke's back.

00:30:23.955 --> 00:30:25.623 line:95%,end
I just looked at Brooked laying there,

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:28.259 line:95%,end
and I thought, you know,
I have one kid with a broken foot,

00:30:29.928 --> 00:30:31.429 line:95%,end
crying because it hurts to breathe.

<i>I just had to draw the line there.</i>

00:30:33.198 --> 00:30:35.333 line:95%,end
I knew what I had to do, as a mom.

00:30:39.838 --> 00:30:42.974 line:95%,end
Abby, I don't think Brooke's
going to do her solo.

00:30:46.611 --> 00:30:48.346 line:95%,end
It hurts when she breathes.

00:30:48.413 --> 00:30:50.014 line:95%,end
I don't know how she's going to do it.

00:30:50.715 --> 00:30:52.217 line:95%,end
I got her ice.

00:30:52.283 --> 00:30:54.719 line:95%,end
I put this on.
I--I don't know what else I can do.

00:30:55.019 --> 00:30:57.388 line:95%,end
I can't let her to herself to do a dance.

00:30:59.591 --> 00:31:01.593 line:95%,end
(sobs) It's obviously hurting her

00:31:01.659 --> 00:31:03.127 line:95%,end
that she can't do it.

00:31:03.194 --> 00:31:04.195 line:95%,end
I want her to do it.

00:31:04.262 --> 00:31:05.230 line:95%,end
She wants to do it,

00:31:05.296 --> 00:31:06.965 line:95%,end
but I don't think she can.

00:31:08.399 --> 00:31:11.135 line:95%,end
I wish Kelly would have
pulled solo earlier,

00:31:11.202 --> 00:31:12.537 line:95%,end
because then maybe Kendall

00:31:12.604 --> 00:31:14.672 line:95%,end
would be dancing a solo today, as well.

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:17.008 line:95%,end
Brooke, you don't--it didn't
have anything to do

00:31:17.075 --> 00:31:18.776 line:95%,end
with all those other girls
there warming up?

00:31:19.344 --> 00:31:20.912 line:95%,end
Abby, it was hurting

00:31:20.979 --> 00:31:22.847 line:95%,end
before we even came to this building.

00:31:23.181 --> 00:31:25.783 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>I think Kelly and Brooke</i>

00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:27.685 line:95%,end
They're going to pull this number

00:31:27.752 --> 00:31:28.653 line:95%,end
because she knows

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:31.456 line:95%,end

00:31:31.522 --> 00:31:33.424 line:95%,end

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:38.162 line:95%,end
Brooke, if you are going to continue

00:31:38.229 --> 00:31:40.698 line:95%,end
to stand like a three-year-old
with that sway back,

00:31:40.765 --> 00:31:42.233 line:95%,end
your back is going to hurt!

00:31:42.734 --> 00:31:44.035 line:95%,end
You and I both know

00:31:44.102 --> 00:31:46.571 line:95%,end
that lazy gets you nowhere!

00:31:47.438 --> 00:31:49.741 line:95%,end
I gave you an amazing number!

00:31:49.807 --> 00:31:50.842 line:95%,end
And now you're not going to do it?

00:31:50.909 --> 00:31:51.910 line:95%,end
No one's ever going to see it?

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:53.745 line:95%,end
She can't do it.

00:31:54.345 --> 00:31:55.380 line:95%,end
ABBY: I told you guys before,

00:31:55.446 --> 00:31:57.615 line:95%,end
you make choices every single day.

00:31:57.682 --> 00:31:58.816 line:95%,end
Make the right one.

00:31:59.517 --> 00:32:01.719 line:95%,end
I can't let her hurt herself
to do a dance.

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:03.288 line:95%,end
I'm sorry.

00:32:03.354 --> 00:32:04.756 line:95%,end

<i>It's Chloe and Kendall</i>

(cheers and applause)

00:37:49.967 --> 00:37:51.469 line:95%,end
This is great for me

00:37:51.535 --> 00:37:52.503 line:95%,end
to let Abby know,

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:54.272 line:5%,start
<i>you can count on this kid</i>

00:37:54.338 --> 00:37:56.674 line:5%,start
<i>to do the choreography you're giving her,</i>

00:37:56.741 --> 00:37:58.175 line:95%,end
and she can win on stage.

00:37:58.242 --> 00:38:01.479 line:5%,start
(cheers and applause)

00:38:01.545 --> 00:38:03.581 line:95%,end
(cheering)

00:38:03.648 --> 00:38:06.150 line:95%,end
Girls, congratulations!

00:38:06.717 --> 00:38:08.586 line:95%,end
Congratulations, ladies!

00:38:08.653 --> 00:38:09.854 line:95%,end
Thank you!

00:38:10.187 --> 00:38:11.022 line:95%,end
Good job, Maddie!

00:38:11.088 --> 00:38:12.290 line:95%,end
Girl!

00:38:12.356 --> 00:38:13.758 line:95%,end
I watched you step into those turns.

00:38:13.824 --> 00:38:15.059 line:95%,end
I was like--

00:38:15.126 --> 00:38:17.194 line:95%,end
right there, you nailed those. Huh?

00:38:17.962 --> 00:38:20.231 line:95%,end
Talk about <i>Drop Dead Diva.</i>
You are the diva.

00:38:21.232 --> 00:38:22.066 line:95%,end
Yes!

00:38:22.133 --> 00:38:23.067 line:95%,end
Good job.

00:38:24.235 --> 00:38:27.204 line:95%,end
Listen. I blocked out
the whole <i>Drop Dead Diva </i>routine

00:38:27.271 --> 00:38:29.040 line:95%,end
because I wanted you to concentrate
on this number

00:38:29.106 --> 00:38:29.974 line:95%,end
and on the group number.

00:38:30.041 --> 00:38:31.742 line:95%,end
But now that the group won

00:38:31.809 --> 00:38:33.511 line:95%,end
and your solo is finished,

00:38:33.577 --> 00:38:35.212 line:95%,end
I want to see what they had you do.

00:38:35.279 --> 00:38:36.881 line:95%,end
So can you show it to me?

00:38:36.947 --> 00:38:38.849 line:95%,end
I'm sure everybody else
wants to see it, too.

00:38:39.617 --> 00:38:40.451 line:95%,end
Yes?

00:38:41.652 --> 00:38:43.054 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>I mean, really, Abby?</i>

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:45.456 line:95%,end
<i>These girls have just danced</i>
<i>their heart out.</i>

00:38:45.523 --> 00:38:47.191 line:95%,end
And the only thing
you care about is Maddie

00:38:47.258 --> 00:38:49.694 line:95%,end
running her <i>Drop Dead Diva</i> dance
in front of everyone?

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:51.929 line:95%,end
You're just kind of rubbing this
in everybody's face.

00:38:51.996 --> 00:38:53.664 line:95%,end
I'm not rubbing it in everybody's face.

00:38:53.731 --> 00:38:55.633 line:95%,end
Your name and your reputation--

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:57.668 line:95%,end
what you want them to set
their best foot forward.

00:38:57.735 --> 00:39:00.404 line:95%,end
This is just another example
of Abby's blatant disregard

00:39:00.471 --> 00:39:01.772 line:95%,end
for anyone who is not Maddie.

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:04.241 line:95%,end
KELLY: So I think that next time

00:39:04.308 --> 00:39:06.143 line:95%,end
that we have the opportunity

00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:07.144 line:95%,end
to do an audition,

00:39:07.211 --> 00:39:09.280 line:95%,end
that everybody should get the opportunity.

00:39:09.347 --> 00:39:12.216 line:95%,end
(indistinct chatter)

00:39:14.452 --> 00:39:15.419 line:95%,end
ABBY: Where's she going?

00:39:15.486 --> 00:39:17.288 line:95%,end
-HOLLY: I don't know where she's going.
-ABBY: Maddie!

00:39:17.355 --> 00:39:20.324 line:95%,end
Because of the vultures in this room...

00:39:20.391 --> 00:39:21.225 line:95%,end
-No, Abby.
-ABBY: ...that poor kid

00:39:21.292 --> 00:39:22.526 line:95%,end
-has to go like this.
-No, Abby.

00:39:22.593 --> 00:39:23.728 line:95%,end
-Nope.
-And, you know what?

00:39:23.794 --> 00:39:25.529 line:95%,end
-She doesn't have to, Abby. She does.
-You know who creates the vultures?

00:39:25.596 --> 00:39:26.697 line:95%,end
-It's you.
-HOLLY: No.

00:39:26.764 --> 00:39:28.532 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Because you try to turn
all of these kids

00:39:28.599 --> 00:39:29.600 line:95%,end
against their friend,

00:39:29.667 --> 00:39:31.335 line:95%,end
and that little girl's mortified
all the time,

00:39:31.402 --> 00:39:32.636 line:95%,end
which you don't care.

00:39:32.703 --> 00:39:34.071 line:95%,end
How about being a role model?

00:39:34.138 --> 00:39:37.074 line:95%,end
I have heard you say to her,

00:39:37.141 --> 00:39:39.043 line:95%,end
to that little nine-year-old girl,

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:40.311 line:95%,end
no one would be happy for you.

00:39:40.378 --> 00:39:41.545 line:95%,end
Everyone's jealous of you.

00:39:41.612 --> 00:39:42.747 line:95%,end
-Why do you do that?
-You are!

00:39:42.813 --> 00:39:44.248 line:95%,end
-Look at you!
-CHRISTI: No, we're not!

00:39:44.315 --> 00:39:46.083 line:95%,end
No, we're not.

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:48.252 line:95%,end
-ABBY: Years ago--
-You have sabotaged

00:39:48.319 --> 00:39:49.954 line:95%,end
my daughter and the rest of the kids!

00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:51.288 line:95%,end
Your daughter is a little sneak!

00:39:51.355 --> 00:39:54.291 line:95%,end
-HOLLY: Go out. Girls, go out. Go out.
-How dare you call my daughter a sneak?

00:39:54.358 --> 00:39:56.193 line:95%,end
-Sneak! Sneak! Sneak!
-CHRISTI: She's not a sneak!

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:58.963 line:95%,end
You're a sneak and a snake!

00:39:59.029 --> 00:40:01.265 line:95%,end
You do these things to these kids!

00:40:01.332 --> 00:40:03.834 line:95%,end
-She is talented!
-CHRISTI: Yes, she is!

00:40:03.901 --> 00:40:05.636 line:95%,end
-Nobody's denying it!
-And she should relish it!

00:40:05.703 --> 00:40:07.138 line:95%,end
Because in five years,

00:40:07.204 --> 00:40:09.306 line:95%,end
-she might not be talented anymore!
-CHRISTI: Why did you try

00:40:09.373 --> 00:40:11.442 line:95%,end
-to pit her against her friends?
-Look at Brooke!

00:40:11.509 --> 00:40:13.444 line:95%,end
Don't say my daughter
isn't talented anymore.

00:40:13.511 --> 00:40:14.612 line:95%,end
ABBY: That's not what I just said.

00:40:14.678 --> 00:40:15.713 line:95%,end
-You just said, in five years...
-ABBY: No.

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:17.481 line:95%,end
...she might not be talented anymore.
Look at Brooke!

00:40:17.548 --> 00:40:18.649 line:95%,end
-CHRISTI: She is very talented!
-She may be hurt!

00:40:18.716 --> 00:40:20.050 line:5%,start
-She may never dance again!
-CHRISTI: Everybody is talented!

00:40:20.117 --> 00:40:21.685 line:5%,start
Everyone in this room is talented.

00:40:21.752 --> 00:40:23.587 line:5%,start
-And if you really--
-You're not!

00:40:23.654 --> 00:40:24.488 line:5%,start
Oh, please.

00:40:24.555 --> 00:40:26.257 line:5%,start
I have more talent in my pinky than you.

00:40:26.323 --> 00:40:29.193 line:5%,start
Why? Because you're a whore
selling t-shirts in the bar?

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:30.828 line:5%,start
Oh, Abby, whore!

00:40:30.895 --> 00:40:31.929 line:5%,start
Whore! Whore! Whore!

00:40:31.996 --> 00:40:33.097 line:5%,start
Or, as Kelly would say,

00:40:33.164 --> 00:40:35.466 line:5%,start
maybe you're a virgin
because no one would (bleep) you.

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:38.269 line:5%,start
I've had it with these moms.

00:40:38.335 --> 00:40:40.771 line:5%,start
They're rude and they're nasty,
and they're jealous

00:40:40.838 --> 00:40:42.406 line:5%,start
of a little nine-year-old girl

00:40:42.473 --> 00:40:44.508 line:5%,start
who got a part on a television show.

00:40:45.709 --> 00:40:46.577 line:5%,start
<i>Au revoir.</i>
