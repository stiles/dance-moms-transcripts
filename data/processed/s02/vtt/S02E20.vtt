ABBY: <i>Previously on</i> Dance Moms...

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:06.473 line:5%,start
We are going to Ohio,
to her territory.

KELLY: <i>With the choreography</i>
<i>that Paige has,</i>

00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:09.376 line:5%,start
<i>Kendall is going to be there.</i>

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:11.945 line:5%,start
Go in there,
step up her choreography,

00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:14.180 line:5%,start
<i>so she has the chance</i>

00:00:14.247 --> 00:00:15.815 line:5%,start
Jill called me yesterday.

00:00:15.882 --> 00:00:17.817 line:5%,start
<i>She said that</i>
<i>she's been driving so far.</i>

00:00:17.884 --> 00:00:19.619 line:5%,start
Here's my violin.
I'm so sad for Jill.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.855 line:5%,start
ABBY: And we came to what?

00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:24.357 line:5%,start
ALL: Chop 'em down!

00:00:24.424 --> 00:00:25.959 line:5%,start
JILL: <i>How can I continue</i>
<i>bringing her to you</i>

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:27.627 line:5%,start
<i>when you can't give her</i>
<i>the time of day?</i>

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:30.563 line:5%,start
-Yay!
-ALL: Chop! Chop! Chop! Chop!

ABBY: <i>Coming up on </i>Dance Moms...

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:35.335 line:5%,start
Moms, I'm putting Peyton
in the number,

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:37.103 line:5%,start
and Leslie will be joining us.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.839 line:5%,start
Hey, ladies, I'm back.

00:00:39.906 --> 00:00:42.075 line:5%,start
ABBY: Is she that dumb
that she doesn't know

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:43.710 line:5%,start
there's a field trip
and she's not going on it!

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:45.311 line:5%,start
Just remember,
this is the worst of it.

00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:47.680 line:5%,start
You are nothing
but an intimidating bitch!

00:00:47.747 --> 00:00:49.816 line:5%,start
Go ahead and leave. Shoo.

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:51.551 line:5%,start
Save your tears for the pillow.

00:00:51.618 --> 00:00:53.253 line:5%,start
Just stop.

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:55.655 line:95%,end

Come on, chop, chop.
Chop, chop, moms, get in there.

00:01:17.577 --> 00:01:19.379 line:95%,end
I wouldn't say
it was a brilliant weekend,

00:01:19.446 --> 00:01:21.181 line:95%,end
but I would say it was successful.

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:24.350 line:95%,end
We set out to beat Cathy,
the Wicked Witch of the West.

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:26.019 line:95%,end
And that's what we did.

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:29.222 line:95%,end
We beat her hands down
in every single category.

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:31.524 line:95%,end
You knocked the apple tree down.

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:37.497 line:5%,start
All in all, we had a successful weekend
in Akron, Ohio, at Next Star and...

00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:40.600 line:95%,end
now I think
I'll be in a good mood this week.

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:43.470 line:95%,end
With that said, I want to get
through the pyramid quickly

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:45.638 line:95%,end
because we have tons of work to do.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.675 line:95%,end
On the bottom of the pyramid,

00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:50.510 line:95%,end
Paige.

00:01:52.178 --> 00:01:53.446 line:95%,end
You beat Kendall.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.648 line:95%,end
I'm thrilled with that.

00:01:55.715 --> 00:01:56.783 line:95%,end
You made the top 10.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.052 line:95%,end
But you need to do the choreography
you were taught.

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.687 line:95%,end
You got that, Kelly?

00:02:00.753 --> 00:02:02.856 line:95%,end
You don't change
Abby Lee's choreography.

00:02:02.922 --> 00:02:03.756 line:95%,end
Come on.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.392 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>Paige did well</i>
<i>with my choreography.</i>

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:08.528 line:5%,start
I don't think there's any way
Paige would have won the crown

00:02:08.595 --> 00:02:09.762 line:5%,start
with Abby's choreography.

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:12.565 line:95%,end
ABBY: Moving on, Mackenzie,

00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:14.868 line:95%,end
you've greatly improved.

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:16.269 line:95%,end
But if you're going to be in the dance

00:02:16.336 --> 00:02:17.704 line:95%,end
and you're going to know
the choreography,

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.172 line:95%,end
you have to pull your weight.

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.406 line:95%,end
Understood?

00:02:21.474 --> 00:02:23.977 line:95%,end
Next, Brooke,

00:02:24.043 --> 00:02:25.512 line:95%,end
you are off probation.

00:02:25.578 --> 00:02:26.579 line:95%,end
(clapping)

00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:28.982 line:5%,start
BROOKE:
I'm happy I'm off probation,

00:02:29.048 --> 00:02:32.385 line:5%,start
because being on Abby's bad side
is not a good thing.

00:02:32.452 --> 00:02:34.320 line:95%,end
Where are the stoppers?

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:36.389 line:95%,end
I'll have them for the competition.

00:02:38.258 --> 00:02:39.659 line:95%,end
-ABBY: Done!
-HOLLY: Go get Paige.

00:02:39.726 --> 00:02:41.294 line:95%,end
KELLY: I'm gonna (bleep) kill--

00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:42.562 line:95%,end
ABBY: You're finished.

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.397 line:95%,end
Neither of my kids
are doing a group dance.

00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:45.732 line:95%,end
You're not doing a solo.

00:02:45.798 --> 00:02:47.333 line:95%,end
Let's go, Brooke.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.801 line:95%,end
ABBY: Moving up the ladder,

00:02:48.868 --> 00:02:50.036 line:95%,end
Nia.

00:02:50.737 --> 00:02:52.238 line:95%,end
You have really matured.

00:02:52.305 --> 00:02:55.542 line:95%,end
Less than six months ago,
you were sitting on your dad's lap

00:02:55.608 --> 00:02:57.844 line:95%,end
in a dressing room
bawling your eyeballs out.

00:02:57.911 --> 00:03:00.213 line:95%,end
Don't carry it into the dressing room.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.448 line:95%,end
You go home,
you cry into your pillow,

00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:03.917 line:95%,end
you figure out what you did wrong,

00:03:03.983 --> 00:03:05.752 line:95%,end
and you don't make
the same mistakes again.

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.254 line:95%,end
I don't ever want
to see that again.

00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:10.590 line:95%,end
That little kid is gone.

00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:12.592 line:95%,end
HOLLY: <i>Nia's growing up.</i>

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:13.826 line:5%,start
She's maturing.

00:03:13.893 --> 00:03:16.529 line:5%,start
And I have said that,

00:03:16.596 --> 00:03:18.431 line:95%,end
<i>when it begins to click for Nia,</i>

00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:19.599 line:95%,end
<i>you better watch out.</i>

00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:21.267 line:95%,end
ABBY: Moving on,

00:03:21.334 --> 00:03:22.635 line:95%,end
Maddie.

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:24.637 line:95%,end
You had a big victory last week.


00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:26.472 line:95%,end
All you had to worry about
was the group dance.

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:27.574 line:95%,end
You were excellent.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.877 line:95%,end
You were right on time with the music
and I'm proud of you for that.

00:03:30.944 --> 00:03:33.079 line:95%,end
And on top of the pyramid

00:03:33.146 --> 00:03:35.615 line:95%,end
is my angry bird Chloe.

00:03:35.682 --> 00:03:37.383 line:95%,end
(applause)

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.787 line:95%,end
Chloe, you won the costume award
for the entire competition.

00:03:40.853 --> 00:03:43.356 line:95%,end
And you made the top 10.
Congratulations.

00:03:43.423 --> 00:03:46.993 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.329 line:95%,end
Woo!

00:03:49.696 --> 00:03:51.030 line:95%,end
ABBY: I'm very proud of you.

00:03:51.097 --> 00:03:53.933 line:95%,end
I think you could have had a lot more
confidence when you started the dance.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.669 line:95%,end
But when you finished,
you certainly made up for it.

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:57.570 line:95%,end
Moving on,

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:02.675 line:95%,end
this week, we will be attending
Starbound Talent Competition

00:04:02.742 --> 00:04:04.844 line:95%,end
in Atlanta, Georgia.

00:04:07.013 --> 00:04:09.148 line:95%,end
We're going to go to sunny skies
and hot weather.

00:04:09.215 --> 00:04:11.551 line:95%,end
Moms, I might even sit
on the veranda

00:04:11.618 --> 00:04:13.019 line:95%,end
and have a mint julep with you.

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:14.287 line:95%,end
Oh, aren't we lucky?

00:04:14.354 --> 00:04:15.488 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Lucky us.

00:04:15.555 --> 00:04:16.489 line:95%,end
(laughter)

00:04:16.556 --> 00:04:18.124 line:95%,end
The last time we attended Starbound,

00:04:18.191 --> 00:04:21.594 line:95%,end
you lost by 1/10 of a point
to that Wicked Witch of the West.

00:04:21.661 --> 00:04:24.464 line:95%,end
And I have never lived it down
until this weekend.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.368 line:95%,end
The behavior by Cathy
was out of control.

00:04:28.434 --> 00:04:30.270 line:95%,end
SINGER: <i>âª We saw, we came âª</i>

00:04:30.336 --> 00:04:31.537 line:95%,end
<i>âª We kicked apples âª</i>

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:32.538 line:95%,end
<i>âª We saw, we came âª</i>

00:04:32.605 --> 00:04:35.742 line:95%,end
My entire reputation
has been humiliated.

00:04:35.808 --> 00:04:38.678 line:95%,end
The whole competition was a fiasco.

00:04:38.745 --> 00:04:40.480 line:95%,end
That's not going to happen this time.

00:04:40.546 --> 00:04:42.081 line:95%,end
Do you understand?

00:04:42.148 --> 00:04:43.916 line:95%,end
All the numbers that we're going to do

00:04:43.983 --> 00:04:46.519 line:95%,end
are going to be off the charts.

00:04:48.054 --> 00:04:49.088 line:95%,end
All right.

00:04:49.155 --> 00:04:51.858 line:95%,end
Chloe, you have a solo this week.

00:04:51.924 --> 00:04:54.160 line:95%,end
You will be doing a routine
called "Trouble."

00:04:54.227 --> 00:04:57.230 line:95%,end
You need to learn
to use the entire stage.

00:04:57.297 --> 00:05:00.233 line:95%,end
You need to jump higher
than you've ever jumped.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.169 line:95%,end
I want to see you larger
than life on stage.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.572 line:5%,start
I'm really excited that Miss Abby
gave me a solo this week.

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:09.909 line:95%,end
And I want to prove to Miss Abby
that I do have confidence.

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:12.845 line:95%,end
Maddie, you're back to work this week.

00:05:12.912 --> 00:05:14.547 line:95%,end
You have a solo in the competition.

00:05:14.614 --> 00:05:16.516 line:95%,end
It's in the lyrical category.

00:05:17.016 --> 00:05:19.886 line:95%,end
And it's entitled,
"Mom, It'll Never Be the Same."

00:05:21.054 --> 00:05:22.722 line:95%,end
Now, I also have a trio.

00:05:23.122 --> 00:05:26.826 line:95%,end
The trio is going to be
Paige, Nia, and Mackenzie.

00:05:27.694 --> 00:05:30.196 line:95%,end
Trios are the hardest thing
to choreograph.

00:05:30.263 --> 00:05:31.564 line:95%,end
<i>So this is going to be a nightmare.</i>

00:05:31.631 --> 00:05:34.434 line:95%,end
The trio is entitled,
"Nothing's Gonna Stop Us."

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.135 line:95%,end
And I hope nothing does stop you.

00:05:36.202 --> 00:05:37.937 line:95%,end
Let's move on to the group dance.

00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:42.208 line:95%,end
The group number it's titled,
"All Kids Go."

00:05:42.275 --> 00:05:45.578 line:95%,end
We're talking about
our childhood going away.

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:49.115 line:95%,end
We're talking about Brooke
leaving the eighth grade

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:51.317 line:95%,end
and going to high school.
She's a teenager now.

00:05:51.384 --> 00:05:54.454 line:95%,end
Everybody is in the group dance
except Mackenzie.

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:59.592 line:95%,end
The nature of the dance
is a little mature for you.

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:01.961 line:5%,start
I'm really bummed that I'm not
in the group dance this week

00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:03.930 line:5%,start
because I like dancing
with the big girls.

00:06:03.996 --> 00:06:05.832 line:95%,end
Since I'm not using Mackenzie,

00:06:05.898 --> 00:06:08.668 line:95%,end
I need to bring somebody in
that looks like a teenager,

00:06:09.302 --> 00:06:11.404 line:95%,end
that the judges see instantly

00:06:11.471 --> 00:06:13.139 line:95%,end
as older than the rest of you.

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:15.274 line:95%,end
So moms, look out.

00:06:15.341 --> 00:06:16.976 line:95%,end
I'm putting Peyton in the number,

00:06:17.043 --> 00:06:19.445 line:95%,end
and Leslie will be joining us.

00:06:20.913 --> 00:06:23.316 line:95%,end
The moms and I don't like
whenever Abby brings

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:24.951 line:95%,end
somebody new into the team.

00:06:25.017 --> 00:06:27.553 line:95%,end
I think our team works great
the way it is.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.323 line:95%,end
I don't think that we need anybody else
to come into our group.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.024 line:95%,end
ABBY: I have one more piece of news.

00:06:32.091 --> 00:06:34.260 line:95%,end
You're going to be auditioning
for a TV show.

00:06:34.327 --> 00:06:36.829 line:95%,end
And that TV show is...

00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:38.698 line:95%,end
<i>Drop Dead Diva.</i>

00:06:38.765 --> 00:06:41.501 line:95%,end
(cheering and applause)

00:06:41.567 --> 00:06:44.804 line:95%,end
This week I got a casting call
from the casting agent

00:06:44.871 --> 00:06:46.406 line:95%,end
at <i>Drop Dead Diva.</i>

00:06:46.472 --> 00:06:49.475 line:95%,end
<i>They are looking for a little girl</i>
<i>to play a dancer.</i>


00:06:49.542 --> 00:06:52.145 line:95%,end
Moms, you're gonna put them on camera

00:06:52.211 --> 00:06:55.181 line:95%,end
and actually send the film to LA.

00:06:55.848 --> 00:06:57.483 line:95%,end
I know they're calling
other dance studios,

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:58.851 line:95%,end
other dance companies.

00:06:58.918 --> 00:07:01.320 line:95%,end
But I want my girls to do their very best.

00:07:01.387 --> 00:07:03.156 line:95%,end
They better put their best foot forward.

00:07:03.222 --> 00:07:04.924 line:95%,end
Ladies, up, spread apart.

00:07:04.991 --> 00:07:06.058 line:95%,end
Let's warm up.

00:07:08.494 --> 00:07:10.129 line:95%,end
I like your shoes.
Are they new?

00:07:10.196 --> 00:07:11.864 line:95%,end
Ugh, they are so old.

00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:14.200 line:95%,end
What is up with this TV thing?

00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:16.369 line:95%,end
MELISSA: It'll probably be like,
one line, you know?

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:18.538 line:95%,end
I think it's a great opportunity
for our girls.

00:07:18.604 --> 00:07:21.841 line:95%,end
I think that, you know,
if one of them gets the part

00:07:21.908 --> 00:07:23.843 line:95%,end
and they actually are on a TV show,

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:26.078 line:95%,end
I think that opens
so many doors for them.

00:07:26.145 --> 00:07:28.414 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I would love
to see our kids pull this off.

00:07:28.481 --> 00:07:30.082 line:95%,end
ABBY: Come on, Peyton,
we're ready to start.

00:07:30.149 --> 00:07:31.784 line:95%,end
She is not even part of our group.

00:07:31.851 --> 00:07:34.220 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Because she will be
the star of this dance,

00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:36.088 line:95%,end
just like she was the star
of the last dance.

00:07:36.155 --> 00:07:37.890 line:95%,end
Chloe's at the top
of the pyramid this week.

00:07:37.957 --> 00:07:39.559 line:95%,end
-Why isn't she the featured dancer?
-MELISSA: Mm-hmm.

00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:41.627 line:95%,end
Is this is the first time
that Peyton and Brooke

00:07:41.694 --> 00:07:43.362 line:95%,end
-are dancing together with this group?
-Yes.

00:07:43.429 --> 00:07:46.265 line:95%,end
HOLLY: <i>I struggle with the idea</i>
<i>that Peyton gets to join that group</i>

00:07:46.332 --> 00:07:48.000 line:95%,end
on a temporary basis.

00:07:48.067 --> 00:07:49.502 line:95%,end
And every time she joins the group,

00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:51.237 line:95%,end
she becomes a featured dancer.

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:52.772 line:95%,end
That's gonna be an interesting dynamic.

00:07:52.839 --> 00:07:56.509 line:95%,end
ABBY: Peyton, you will be traveling
to Atlanta, Georgia with us.

00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:59.912 line:95%,end
-Are you ready for that?
-Absolutely.

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:01.747 line:95%,end
Can you keep your mother under control?

00:08:03.249 --> 00:08:07.086 line:95%,end
Well, I'm expecting Leslie
to come up here and be combative.

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:08.321 line:95%,end
She scares me. I'm sorry.

00:08:08.387 --> 00:08:09.422 line:95%,end
Hey, ladies.

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:14.160 line:95%,end
I'm back.

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:18.764 line:95%,end
I am so thrilled to see Leslie again

00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:20.533 line:95%,end
because she's so cordial.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.602 line:95%,end
<i>She doesn't scream at you.</i>

00:08:22.668 --> 00:08:24.871 line:95%,end
And she really does keep
her opinions to herself.

00:08:24.937 --> 00:08:27.273 line:95%,end
I'm so sick of Christ sitting up here

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:28.941 line:95%,end
trying to belittle
and put my daughter down.

00:08:29.008 --> 00:08:30.309 line:95%,end
-Listen--
-Shut your face.

00:08:32.144 --> 00:08:33.746 line:95%,end
LESLIE: Hi, ladies.

00:08:33.813 --> 00:08:35.515 line:95%,end
-KELLY: Hello.
-You're awfully quiet.

00:08:38.217 --> 00:08:41.254 line:95%,end
ABBY:
Girls, we have three days

00:08:41.821 --> 00:08:44.857 line:95%,end
till we are on a plane
headed to Starbound.

00:08:44.924 --> 00:08:48.294 line:95%,end
<i>The last time we attended Starbound,</i>
<i>we got 10th place.</i>

00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:49.762 line:95%,end
And I was humiliated.

00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:51.797 line:95%,end
<i>So this is my redemption tour.</i>

00:08:51.864 --> 00:08:53.399 line:95%,end
<i>We're going back to win big.</i>

00:08:53.466 --> 00:08:54.700 line:95%,end
Let's do it.

00:08:54.767 --> 00:08:57.670 line:95%,end
We are doing a piece
called "All Kids Go."

00:08:57.737 --> 00:08:59.272 line:5%,start
(dramatic music playing)

00:08:59.338 --> 00:09:01.073 line:5%,start
Hit. Hit.

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.608 line:5%,start
Hit. Hit.

00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:04.810 line:95%,end
PliÃ©!

00:09:04.877 --> 00:09:06.479 line:95%,end
<i>It's very dark.</i>

00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:09.415 line:95%,end
It's elegant, classic, beautiful.

00:09:09.482 --> 00:09:11.350 line:95%,end
Everybody big!

00:09:11.417 --> 00:09:12.985 line:95%,end
There you go.

00:09:13.052 --> 00:09:15.388 line:95%,end
Do you see that intricate way of moving?

00:09:15.454 --> 00:09:18.357 line:95%,end
Do you see how captivating it is?

00:09:18.424 --> 00:09:20.493 line:95%,end
You have to be a special performer

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.062 line:95%,end
to get the audience to shut up.

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:26.065 line:95%,end
She is so excited.

00:09:26.132 --> 00:09:28.067 line:95%,end
She really deserves this.
This is great for her.

00:09:28.134 --> 00:09:29.835 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>Leslie will not shut up.</i>

00:09:29.902 --> 00:09:31.370 line:95%,end
Seriously, just hearing her voice

00:09:31.437 --> 00:09:33.573 line:95%,end
makes me want to poke my own eye out.

00:09:33.639 --> 00:09:35.441 line:95%,end
LESLIE: Where's Mackenzie?
Is she not in this?

00:09:35.508 --> 00:09:37.443 line:95%,end
KELLY: Peyton's replacing
Mackenzie this week.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:39.312 line:95%,end
Mackenzie's not mature enough
to be in this.

00:09:39.378 --> 00:09:41.147 line:95%,end
Well, she should not
be replacing anybody.

00:09:41.213 --> 00:09:42.882 line:95%,end
She should be a permanent dancer.

00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:44.083 line:95%,end
Who's doing solos this week?

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:45.585 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Chloe and Maddie.

00:09:45.651 --> 00:09:47.587 line:95%,end
LESLIE:
Maybe she'll let Peyton do a solo.

00:09:48.521 --> 00:09:52.592 line:95%,end
If everyone else is doing a solo
or a duet or a trio, why not?

00:09:52.658 --> 00:09:55.628 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Leslie's been here
for like a total of, what, five minutes?

00:09:55.695 --> 00:09:58.397 line:95%,end
And here she is not only thinking
that Peyton can join the group dance

00:09:58.464 --> 00:10:00.399 line:95%,end
but she's gonna have a solo.
Seriously?

00:10:00.466 --> 00:10:03.402 line:95%,end
Maybe she'll let her.
It won't hurt to ask.

00:10:03.469 --> 00:10:05.104 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>I don't know</i>
<i>where Leslie gets off thinking</i>

00:10:05.171 --> 00:10:08.240 line:95%,end
she can just waltz in here
and say Peyton deserves a solo.

00:10:08.307 --> 00:10:10.810 line:95%,end
<i>I can tell this is going to be</i>
<i>a really long week.</i>


00:10:13.579 --> 00:10:16.916 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:10:18.551 --> 00:10:21.153 line:95%,end
CATHY: <i>Hey, moms, dancers!</i>

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:22.922 line:95%,end
What do you guys think?

00:10:22.989 --> 00:10:23.956 line:95%,end
It's nice.

00:10:24.023 --> 00:10:27.893 line:95%,end
This room is totally dedicated
just for you guys.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.096 line:95%,end
(applause)

00:10:30.162 --> 00:10:33.799 line:95%,end
Now, I'm just filled with big news today,
everybody.

00:10:33.866 --> 00:10:36.469 line:95%,end
I don't think that we're going
to be seeing Kendall anymore.

00:10:36.535 --> 00:10:40.906 line:95%,end
Her mother made a great decision
to decide to leave.

00:10:40.973 --> 00:10:43.809 line:5%,start
Jill has decided to leave
Candy Apples Dance Center

00:10:43.876 --> 00:10:47.546 line:5%,start
because I'm not giving Kendall
enough time.

00:10:47.613 --> 00:10:51.117 line:95%,end
JILL: But if you can't give
my student enough time,

00:10:51.183 --> 00:10:53.586 line:95%,end
how can I continue
to keep bringing her to you?

00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:56.756 line:95%,end
She should have stuck around
to see what we had to offer.

00:10:56.822 --> 00:11:00.226 line:95%,end
We don't have any competitions
coming up right this very moment.

00:11:00.292 --> 00:11:03.229 line:95%,end
But I received a phone call
from a casting agent

00:11:03.295 --> 00:11:06.132 line:95%,end
who wants you girls to read

00:11:06.198 --> 00:11:08.734 line:95%,end
for the show "Drop Dead Diva."

00:11:08.801 --> 00:11:09.802 line:95%,end
Doesn't that sound like fun?

00:11:12.672 --> 00:11:13.572 line:95%,end
I beg.

00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:14.740 line:95%,end
Do not make me do it.

00:11:14.807 --> 00:11:17.276 line:95%,end
Excuse me, ladies,
you're all here to audition.

00:11:18.177 --> 00:11:20.346 line:95%,end
I'm going to take you in
one at a time.

00:11:20.413 --> 00:11:22.581 line:95%,end
I want you to memorize those lines.

00:11:22.648 --> 00:11:25.685 line:5%,start
Today we're going to record our auditions
for "Drop Dead Diva."

00:11:25.751 --> 00:11:28.354 line:95%,end
I'm really nervous about it
because I know

00:11:28.421 --> 00:11:30.923 line:95%,end
they're calling other dance studios
in the area too.

00:11:31.791 --> 00:11:33.325 line:95%,end
-ABBY: Hello.
-Hello.

00:11:33.392 --> 00:11:35.227 line:95%,end
-How are you today?
-Good, how are you?

00:11:35.294 --> 00:11:37.029 line:95%,end
Good. I'm gonna have you stand right here.

00:11:37.463 --> 00:11:38.931 line:95%,end
Look into the camera.

00:11:38.998 --> 00:11:41.167 line:95%,end
I really hope I get this part
because I think it would be fun

00:11:41.233 --> 00:11:43.903 line:95%,end
to be on a TV show
and see the set and everything.

00:11:43.969 --> 00:11:47.173 line:95%,end
TAYLOR: Hi, my name is Taylor,
and I'm auditioning "fer"--

00:11:47.239 --> 00:11:49.208 line:95%,end
-CATHY: For!
-TAYLOR: Yeah, for what?

00:11:49.275 --> 00:11:51.977 line:95%,end
-Yeah, for--you tell me for what.
-(laughter)

00:11:52.044 --> 00:11:53.045 line:95%,end
Now take it from the top.

00:11:53.112 --> 00:11:56.015 line:95%,end
Stop. I--I'm done.

00:11:56.716 --> 00:11:59.151 line:95%,end
-(inaudible)
-Chloe.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.321 line:95%,end
-Hello?
-Sorry, that was--

00:12:02.388 --> 00:12:03.889 line:95%,end
Okay, take 2.

00:12:03.956 --> 00:12:04.990 line:95%,end
It's all right.

00:12:05.057 --> 00:12:06.358 line:95%,end
No, it's not!

00:12:06.992 --> 00:12:08.794 line:95%,end
I--it was too hard.

00:12:08.861 --> 00:12:11.497 line:95%,end
I really hope I get the part
on <i>Drop Dead Diva</i>

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:13.466 line:95%,end
because it's just like
winning the lottery.

00:12:13.532 --> 00:12:15.267 line:95%,end
And I think that's really cool.

00:12:15.334 --> 00:12:16.669 line:95%,end
(stuttering)

00:12:17.536 --> 00:12:18.971 line:95%,end
-Choreography.
-VIVI: Chor--

00:12:19.038 --> 00:12:20.339 line:95%,end
Choreography.

00:12:20.406 --> 00:12:21.474 line:95%,end
I can't say it.

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:23.609 line:95%,end
Use another dancer. I'm done!

00:12:23.676 --> 00:12:25.010 line:95%,end
TAYLOR: Use another dancer.

00:12:25.077 --> 00:12:26.378 line:95%,end
I'm done.

00:12:26.445 --> 00:12:28.013 line:95%,end
-Where should I go?
-Go.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.048 line:95%,end
Out.

00:12:29.749 --> 00:12:30.883 line:95%,end
Okay, very nice audition.

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:32.351 line:95%,end
-Thank you.
-Thank you. You can go.

00:12:32.418 --> 00:12:35.020 line:95%,end
I think that my girls did
an outstanding job today.

00:12:35.087 --> 00:12:37.757 line:95%,end
<i>I think that one of my girls</i>
<i>is gonna get it,</i>

00:12:37.823 --> 00:12:40.159 line:95%,end
<i>maybe Paige, maybe Maddie.</i>

00:12:40.226 --> 00:12:41.660 line:95%,end
But that's not up to me now, is it?

00:12:41.727 --> 00:12:43.095 line:95%,end
It's up to the casting doctor.

00:12:45.698 --> 00:12:46.732 line:95%,end
MELISSA: <i>Happy birthday!</i>

00:12:46.799 --> 00:12:48.801 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Cheers to the circle
of impenetrable bitches.

00:12:48.868 --> 00:12:50.836 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>Today I'm going to lunch</i>
<i>with all the other moms</i>

00:12:50.903 --> 00:12:53.272 line:5%,start
and we're going to discuss
my birthday party.

00:12:53.339 --> 00:12:55.441 line:95%,end
<i>I certainly don't want</i>
<i>to have a boring party.</i>

00:12:55.508 --> 00:12:58.110 line:95%,end
So we got to like,
do all of our plans.

00:12:58.177 --> 00:13:01.013 line:95%,end
I think we should have like,
a signature drink at our party.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.848 line:95%,end
I have a signature drink,

00:13:02.915 --> 00:13:04.917 line:95%,end
-mommy juice.
-Mommy juice.

00:13:04.984 --> 00:13:05.918 line:95%,end
(laughs)

00:13:05.985 --> 00:13:07.286 line:95%,end
-CHRISTI: And I'm pissed at you.
-Why?

00:13:07.353 --> 00:13:09.488 line:95%,end
Why would you invite Leslie to your party?

00:13:10.256 --> 00:13:12.525 line:95%,end
-Well, what are we gonna do?
-CHRISTI: Why wouldn't you have waited?

00:13:12.591 --> 00:13:15.361 line:95%,end
Have it on Thursday,
and then like, Friday us go away

00:13:15.427 --> 00:13:16.929 line:95%,end
-and be like (indistinct) the party.
-CHRISTI: Yes.

00:13:16.996 --> 00:13:19.698 line:95%,end
I'm inviting Leslie to my party
because,

00:13:19.765 --> 00:13:21.333 line:95%,end
<i>you know, we didn't invite her</i>
<i>to lunch.</i>

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.636 line:95%,end
So I feel like even though
the other moms don't like her,

00:13:23.702 --> 00:13:25.004 line:95%,end
I feel like I have to invite her.

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:28.340 line:95%,end
I think Leslie
is the ultimate stage mother.

00:13:28.407 --> 00:13:29.375 line:95%,end
Oh, she is.

00:13:29.441 --> 00:13:31.210 line:95%,end
KELLY: Oh, I think she's way
more cutthroat than Jill was.

00:13:31.277 --> 00:13:34.313 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: She will knock you down
and steal your teeth

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:36.615 line:95%,end
if it means that her kid
will get a part over yours.

00:13:36.682 --> 00:13:38.851 line:5%,start
Abby and Leslie
are very similar creatures.

00:13:38.918 --> 00:13:40.152 line:5%,start
They want to be dominant.

00:13:40.219 --> 00:13:41.620 line:5%,start
They want to be the boss.

00:13:41.687 --> 00:13:42.788 line:95%,end
They want to be in control.

00:13:42.855 --> 00:13:45.257 line:95%,end
And they want to tell you exactly
what you need to think.

00:13:45.324 --> 00:13:47.259 line:95%,end
I actually have--I have some news.

00:13:47.326 --> 00:13:49.895 line:95%,end
Chloe is gonna miss rehearsal tonight.

00:13:49.962 --> 00:13:51.463 line:95%,end
-Oh.
-And I have not told Abby.

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:54.133 line:95%,end
Because I sent her away

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.402 line:95%,end
on her school field trip
that's overnight.

00:13:56.468 --> 00:13:58.437 line:95%,end
Last week I let Chloe go to the movies.

00:13:58.504 --> 00:14:01.607 line:95%,end
I think me telling Abby that Chloe
is not gonna be at rehearsal tonight

00:14:01.674 --> 00:14:03.542 line:95%,end
is gonna go down like the Titanic.

00:14:03.609 --> 00:14:06.245 line:5%,start
(upbeat music playing)

00:14:06.312 --> 00:14:09.548 line:5%,start
ABBY: Okay, ladies,
we have lots to do.

00:14:09.615 --> 00:14:10.716 line:95%,end
We're ready to start rehearsal.

00:14:10.783 --> 00:14:12.785 line:95%,end
<i>I walk into the den to gather the girls.</i>

00:14:12.852 --> 00:14:15.554 line:95%,end
I look around, and I figure
Chloe's just in the ladies room.


00:14:16.055 --> 00:14:17.389 line:95%,end
Late last night,

00:14:17.456 --> 00:14:19.925 line:95%,end
I decided to let Chloe go
on her school field trip.

00:14:20.392 --> 00:14:22.528 line:95%,end
She's not here this evening.
She'll be back tomorrow morning.

00:14:22.595 --> 00:14:24.363 line:95%,end
She made a commitment
to this group.

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:26.565 line:95%,end
You as a parent also made
a commitment to this group.

00:14:26.632 --> 00:14:28.968 line:95%,end
Yeah, and I made a commitment
to Chloe's education,

00:14:29.034 --> 00:14:30.269 line:95%,end
and this is a school field trip.

00:14:30.336 --> 00:14:32.872 line:95%,end
I'm livid. We've got a big weekend
ahead of us,

00:14:32.938 --> 00:14:34.540 line:95%,end
<i>and Chloe's not even at rehearsal.</i>

00:14:34.607 --> 00:14:37.176 line:95%,end
Do they not want to go
to Starbound this weekend,

00:14:37.243 --> 00:14:38.811 line:95%,end
or do they just not want to win?

00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:40.579 line:95%,end
Why didn't she tell me yesterday?

00:14:40.646 --> 00:14:41.747 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Because she didn't know.

00:14:41.814 --> 00:14:43.015 line:95%,end
I think you're lying.

00:14:43.082 --> 00:14:45.084 line:95%,end
I think you knew
she was going all the time

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:47.086 line:95%,end
and you want to make it seem
like you made this last-minute decision.

00:14:47.152 --> 00:14:48.821 line:95%,end
-No, I didn't.
-You're a snake and a liar,

00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:51.023 line:95%,end
and you're raising your kid
to be the same exact thing.

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:52.825 line:95%,end
Even though Chloe went
on the school field trip,

00:14:52.892 --> 00:14:54.894 line:95%,end
it was really important
that I be in attendance

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.528 line:95%,end
at rehearsals this evening.

00:14:56.595 --> 00:14:59.999 line:95%,end
Because it's my job to protect my kid
from the evil dance teacher.

00:15:00.065 --> 00:15:02.568 line:95%,end
You should have told me ahead of time.

00:15:02.635 --> 00:15:04.770 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: You're acting like a lunatic
because school

00:15:04.837 --> 00:15:06.338 line:95%,end
has taken priority for once.

00:15:06.405 --> 00:15:07.907 line:95%,end
It's not school. It's a field trip.

00:15:07.973 --> 00:15:08.941 line:95%,end
-It's a camping trip.
-It's school!

00:15:09.008 --> 00:15:11.377 line:95%,end
ABBY: Go to to freakin' Girl Scouts
and go camping.

00:15:11.443 --> 00:15:13.579 line:95%,end
Is she that dumb
that she doesn't know

00:15:13.646 --> 00:15:15.381 line:95%,end
there's a field trip
and she's not going on it?

00:15:15.447 --> 00:15:17.283 line:95%,end
I'm gonna pretend
you didn't call my daughter dumb.

00:15:17.349 --> 00:15:20.286 line:5%,start
Chloe is not present
because she went away on a school trip.

00:15:20.352 --> 00:15:23.122 line:95%,end
<i>I would love for Peyton to do a solo.</i>
<i>Why not?</i>

00:15:23.188 --> 00:15:25.424 line:95%,end
They all said that they have solos
and there's a trio.

00:15:25.491 --> 00:15:28.360 line:95%,end
And I just won--
can she do a solo this weekend?

00:15:29.828 --> 00:15:31.864 line:95%,end
Sure, Peyton, you're on.

00:15:31.931 --> 00:15:34.199 line:95%,end
Like, wow, Leslie,
the body's not even cold

00:15:34.266 --> 00:15:35.601 line:95%,end
and you're already swooping in.

00:15:36.335 --> 00:15:38.704 line:95%,end
Girls, remember, we have two days

00:15:39.505 --> 00:15:41.907 line:95%,end
to clean the number, perfect it.

00:15:41.974 --> 00:15:43.876 line:95%,end
-And it's not even finished yet.
-CHRISTI: You know what?

00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:46.745 line:95%,end
I don't give a crap what Abby thinks
because it's none of her concern.

00:15:46.812 --> 00:15:49.281 line:95%,end
Don't you call somebody dumb and stupid

00:15:49.348 --> 00:15:51.083 line:95%,end
because they want to expand
their horizons.

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:53.619 line:95%,end
Well, I wasn't taking anybody's spot.

00:15:53.686 --> 00:15:55.688 line:95%,end
I wanted Peyton to be added
onto the roster

00:15:55.754 --> 00:15:58.090 line:95%,end
whether Chloe was doing a solo
or not. So--

00:15:58.157 --> 00:16:00.626 line:95%,end
KELLY: So is Peyton going to learn
a new dance?

00:16:00.693 --> 00:16:03.862 line:95%,end
I don't understand why you
are questioning Peyton's solo.

00:16:03.929 --> 00:16:06.165 line:95%,end
I don't have--
I don't have a question with it.

00:16:06.231 --> 00:16:07.967 line:95%,end
I'm just asking,
is she learning a new dance?

00:16:08.033 --> 00:16:10.035 line:95%,end
-Is it because--
-Did I not speak to you, Leslie?

00:16:10.102 --> 00:16:11.770 line:95%,end
Nobody else is asking
about Peyton's solo?

00:16:11.837 --> 00:16:12.805 line:95%,end
KELLY: So what!

00:16:12.871 --> 00:16:14.907 line:95%,end
Even if Peyton didn't get
a solo this week,

00:16:14.974 --> 00:16:17.042 line:95%,end
<i>Kelly would have found</i>
<i>something else to yell about.</i>

00:16:17.109 --> 00:16:18.310 line:95%,end
That's just what she does.

00:16:19.311 --> 00:16:22.181 line:5%,start
(dramatic music playing)

00:16:22.247 --> 00:16:25.918 line:5%,start
Maddie's solo is exquisite.

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:29.254 line:95%,end
SINGER: <i>âª Stay with me âª</i>

00:16:29.321 --> 00:16:31.657 line:95%,end
ABBY: I've been holding on
to this music for a long time now

00:16:31.724 --> 00:16:34.793 line:95%,end
because I wanted Maddie
to be mature enough.

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:37.730 line:95%,end
Now, the choreography is fabulous.

00:16:37.796 --> 00:16:39.765 line:95%,end
But the story needs to be there.

00:16:39.832 --> 00:16:43.135 line:95%,end
I need you to convey that message,

00:16:44.336 --> 00:16:47.706 line:95%,end
that Mom,
it's never gonna be the same again.

00:16:47.773 --> 00:16:49.141 line:95%,end
All right.

00:16:49.208 --> 00:16:51.076 line:5%,start
<i>Out of all my numbers this week,</i>

00:16:51.143 --> 00:16:53.012 line:5%,start
<i>the trio has been the hardest to block.</i>

00:16:53.078 --> 00:16:55.414 line:95%,end
I have three different ages
I'm dealing with here.

00:16:55.481 --> 00:16:58.717 line:95%,end
The name of your routine
is "There's Nothing Gonna Stop Us."

00:16:58.784 --> 00:16:59.985 line:95%,end
It's fast.

00:17:00.052 --> 00:17:01.053 line:95%,end
It's peppy.

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:01.954 line:95%,end
Say it.

00:17:02.021 --> 00:17:04.523 line:95%,end
ALL: Nothing's gonna stop us!

00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:06.859 line:95%,end
They need energy.

00:17:06.925 --> 00:17:09.028 line:95%,end
And these three slugs don't have it.

00:17:09.595 --> 00:17:12.498 line:95%,end
SINGER: <i>âª Come on, can you feel it,</i>
<i>make your move âª</i>

00:17:12.564 --> 00:17:14.533 line:95%,end
<i>âª Get your friend on the floor,</i>
<i>together you can groove âª</i>

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:16.735 line:95%,end
You took all--
look up the room you took up.

00:17:16.802 --> 00:17:18.771 line:95%,end
Right here, you should land
right here in the middle

00:17:18.837 --> 00:17:20.072 line:95%,end
of that mirror, yes?

00:17:20.139 --> 00:17:21.707 line:95%,end
Not all the way over there
behind Paige.

00:17:21.774 --> 00:17:25.244 line:95%,end
Girls, this is why you never get
a group routine.

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:27.346 line:95%,end
If you could pick it up
and do it right the first time,

00:17:27.413 --> 00:17:28.480 line:95%,end
I can do it.

00:17:28.547 --> 00:17:29.615 line:95%,end
Continue.

00:17:31.016 --> 00:17:34.787 line:95%,end
The girls individually
can do every stunt pretty well.

00:17:34.853 --> 00:17:37.523 line:95%,end
But the three of them together,
not going so well.

00:17:37.589 --> 00:17:39.992 line:5%,start
SINGER: <i>âª Your black heart âª</i>

00:17:40.859 --> 00:17:42.594 line:95%,end
<i>âª So... âª</i>

00:17:42.661 --> 00:17:44.029 line:95%,end
She put Peyton in Chloe's spot.

00:17:44.096 --> 00:17:45.497 line:95%,end
Chloe has to be
in the dance because--

00:17:45.564 --> 00:17:46.865 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: No, no, Chloe's in the dance,

00:17:46.932 --> 00:17:48.834 line:95%,end
but she's no longer in her good spot.

00:17:53.372 --> 00:17:54.706 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>I don't even miss Chloe.</i>

00:17:56.575 --> 00:17:59.611 line:95%,end
I'm really glad that I allowed Chloe
to go on her field trip.

00:17:59.678 --> 00:18:01.814 line:95%,end
However, I am a nervous wreck.

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:05.484 line:95%,end
I would never really admit this
to Abby, but like,

00:18:05.551 --> 00:18:07.719 line:95%,end
Chloe not being here,
as much as I wanted her to go,

00:18:07.786 --> 00:18:09.388 line:95%,end
-does stress me out a little bit.
-Sure.

00:18:09.455 --> 00:18:11.924 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I think she'll be fine.
But it's still stressful for me.

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:13.659 line:95%,end
She does pick up very well.

00:18:13.725 --> 00:18:15.060 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Very easy.

00:18:15.127 --> 00:18:16.061 line:95%,end
Sometimes.


00:18:18.363 --> 00:18:21.900 line:5%,start
(chill music playing)

00:18:23.001 --> 00:18:24.636 line:95%,end
-ABBY: Hi.
-Hello.

00:18:24.703 --> 00:18:25.704 line:95%,end
Hello, girls.

00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:27.106 line:95%,end
Go ahead and get ready, girls.

00:18:27.973 --> 00:18:29.541 line:95%,end
Abby, I wanted to see
if I could talk to.

00:18:29.608 --> 00:18:31.343 line:95%,end
You keep bringing Peyton
into the group.

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:34.279 line:95%,end
Why does she get to come in
and get a solo,

00:18:34.346 --> 00:18:38.684 line:95%,end
when Nia, Paige,
Kenzie do this every weekend?

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:41.120 line:95%,end
You know they want to do it
or they wouldn't be here.

00:18:41.186 --> 00:18:42.621 line:5%,start
Peyton wants to work.

00:18:42.688 --> 00:18:43.989 line:95%,end
<i>She wants to be gone every weekend.</i>

00:18:44.056 --> 00:18:45.591 line:95%,end
These kids could care less.

00:18:45.657 --> 00:18:47.326 line:95%,end
KELLY: My daughter is here
every single practice.

00:18:47.392 --> 00:18:48.827 line:95%,end
I--it's my dance company.

00:18:48.894 --> 00:18:50.629 line:95%,end
That's fine.
You'll lose more students.

00:18:50.696 --> 00:18:53.465 line:5%,start
I think we all know
that Abby is gonna continue

00:18:53.532 --> 00:18:55.901 line:5%,start
to keep bringing Leslie and Peyton
into our group.

00:18:55.968 --> 00:18:58.670 line:95%,end
So I think we have come
to the decision that,

00:18:58.737 --> 00:19:00.873 line:95%,end
if we want to get rid of them,
we need to do it ourselves.

00:19:05.777 --> 00:19:08.147 line:95%,end
ABBY: We have one day to clean it,

00:19:08.213 --> 00:19:10.649 line:95%,end
perfect it, time it. So let's go.

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:13.685 line:5%,start
Finish that. Don't think about 3.

00:19:13.752 --> 00:19:15.120 line:5%,start
Think about 4.

00:19:16.555 --> 00:19:18.390 line:95%,end
Push! That's bad.

00:19:18.457 --> 00:19:20.225 line:95%,end
Back of the knee, lock it!

00:19:20.292 --> 00:19:22.427 line:95%,end
PEYTON: <i>I'm really happy</i>
<i>Abby gave me a solo this week</i>

00:19:22.494 --> 00:19:23.428 line:95%,end
<i>called "Eternally."</i>

00:19:23.495 --> 00:19:25.797 line:95%,end
We only have a certain
amount of time to learn it,

00:19:25.864 --> 00:19:28.066 line:95%,end
and I'm not used to it
like these girls are.

00:19:28.133 --> 00:19:29.835 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: What was the discussion
you were having

00:19:29.902 --> 00:19:31.303 line:95%,end
with our fearless leader?

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:34.506 line:95%,end
I was just asking why Peyton
was allowed to do a solo

00:19:34.573 --> 00:19:38.310 line:95%,end
when three of our kids who are part
of the group didn't get a solo.

00:19:38.377 --> 00:19:40.379 line:5%,start
If these people want
to waste their time

00:19:40.445 --> 00:19:43.582 line:5%,start
just worrying about what
another mother's daughter is getting,

00:19:43.649 --> 00:19:45.784 line:95%,end
let them do it. It's not for me.

00:19:45.851 --> 00:19:48.754 line:95%,end
I didn't think it was that
much of a crime to ask Abby

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:50.856 line:95%,end
if my daughter can do a solo
since everybody else was doing one.

00:19:50.923 --> 00:19:53.692 line:95%,end
KELLY: We really don't appreciate
you coming into our group

00:19:53.759 --> 00:19:56.461 line:95%,end
and changing our words and telling us

00:19:56.528 --> 00:19:58.997 line:95%,end
how your daughter deserves
to be in the group more than ours,

00:19:59.064 --> 00:20:01.066 line:95%,end
just like your daughter came
into our greenroom

00:20:01.133 --> 00:20:02.467 line:95%,end
and told her she was better than us.

00:20:02.534 --> 00:20:04.937 line:95%,end
I thought that I was better
than most of the people for all around.

00:20:05.003 --> 00:20:07.406 line:95%,end
ABBY: You thought were better
than most of the people in this group?

00:20:09.408 --> 00:20:10.409 line:95%,end
Hmm.

00:20:10.475 --> 00:20:12.044 line:95%,end
LESLIE: Your daughter has a trio.

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:13.679 line:95%,end
Does anybody make you happy?

00:20:13.745 --> 00:20:15.047 line:95%,end
<i>These women don't respect anything.</i>

00:20:15.113 --> 00:20:16.448 line:95%,end
They're never happy.

00:20:16.515 --> 00:20:20.285 line:95%,end
They're not happy
if somebody is not in the number.

00:20:20.352 --> 00:20:22.754 line:95%,end
They're not happy
if somebody is in the number.

00:20:22.821 --> 00:20:24.723 line:95%,end
They're not happy
if they're not getting a trio.

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:26.658 line:95%,end
But when they get the trio,
they're not happy if somebody

00:20:26.725 --> 00:20:29.061 line:95%,end
gets a solo while they get the trio.
It's ridiculous.

00:20:29.127 --> 00:20:32.130 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:20:36.401 --> 00:20:38.570 line:95%,end
CHLOE: Coming back to the studio
after my camping trip,

00:20:38.637 --> 00:20:40.272 line:95%,end
I'm a little bit nervous
to see Miss Abby

00:20:40.339 --> 00:20:42.007 line:95%,end
and see what she has to say to me.

00:20:43.075 --> 00:20:45.510 line:95%,end
Just remember, this is worst of it.
And wasn't it fun?

00:20:45.577 --> 00:20:49.314 line:95%,end
Wasn't last night worth it,
with the campfire and the hiking?

00:20:49.381 --> 00:20:50.782 line:95%,end
Yeah? Okay.

00:20:50.849 --> 00:20:52.384 line:5%,start
Chloe's back
from her school camping trip

00:20:52.451 --> 00:20:54.620 line:5%,start
and she's really nervous
to go talk to Abby.

00:20:54.686 --> 00:20:57.689 line:95%,end
She's afraid that Abby is gonna
cut her dance from the competition.

00:20:57.756 --> 00:21:00.125 line:95%,end
I won't let her do anything wicked to you.

00:21:00.192 --> 00:21:02.628 line:95%,end
Just let it go in one ear
and out the other.

00:21:02.694 --> 00:21:04.830 line:95%,end
Well, our little forest ranger's back.

00:21:04.896 --> 00:21:07.699 line:95%,end
She missed rehearsal yesterday,
and I really should pull her solo.

00:21:07.766 --> 00:21:09.568 line:95%,end
<i>But she's on top of the pyramid</i>
<i>this week.</i>

00:21:09.635 --> 00:21:12.070 line:95%,end
So I want to see
if Chloe can remember it.

00:21:12.137 --> 00:21:13.872 line:95%,end
The name of your routine is "Trouble."

00:21:13.939 --> 00:21:15.540 line:95%,end
And you're kind of in trouble today.

00:21:15.607 --> 00:21:17.542 line:95%,end
Anything that has to do
with school is fine.

00:21:17.609 --> 00:21:19.711 line:95%,end
But you just told me yourself today

00:21:19.778 --> 00:21:22.581 line:95%,end
that some kids didn't go on the trip
and it was optional.


00:21:22.648 --> 00:21:23.582 line:95%,end
I mean, really?

00:21:23.649 --> 00:21:25.417 line:95%,end
I can't even believe
she had the nerve to show up.

00:21:25.484 --> 00:21:28.487 line:5%,start
(dramatic music playing)

00:21:29.988 --> 00:21:33.225 line:95%,end
-What's the title of this dance?
-"Trouble" because, you know,

00:21:34.059 --> 00:21:35.761 line:95%,end
Chloe and trouble are synonyms.

00:21:35.827 --> 00:21:38.463 line:95%,end
ABBY: We should have done
the standing back tuck on upside down.

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:39.831 line:95%,end
Her mother thinks she can.

00:21:40.732 --> 00:21:43.035 line:95%,end
I am really excited
to do my solo this week.

00:21:43.101 --> 00:21:45.570 line:95%,end
<i>I think Miss Abby's putting</i>
<i>a lot of pressure on me.</i>

00:21:45.637 --> 00:21:49.675 line:95%,end
Your teachers have you
from 7:30 in the morning, then I get you.

00:21:49.741 --> 00:21:50.842 line:95%,end
So don't sign up for anything else.

00:21:50.909 --> 00:21:52.611 line:95%,end
If it's at night, you can't do it.

00:21:52.678 --> 00:21:53.945 line:95%,end
<i>I'm impressed.</i>

00:21:54.012 --> 00:21:56.315 line:95%,end
<i>Chloe knew her solo</i>
<i>and I think it's a winner.</i>

00:21:56.381 --> 00:21:58.383 line:95%,end
I knew she could do it.
I knew she was gonna know it.

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:00.619 line:95%,end
You're finished. Thank you.

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:08.327 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:22:10.228 --> 00:22:11.296 line:95%,end
KELLY: Hello!

00:22:11.363 --> 00:22:13.699 line:95%,end
I brought your two favorite things,

00:22:13.765 --> 00:22:15.667 line:95%,end
mineral water and abs.

00:22:15.734 --> 00:22:16.768 line:95%,end
(laughs)

00:22:16.835 --> 00:22:18.637 line:95%,end
You know, this was my 41st birthday,

00:22:18.704 --> 00:22:21.006 line:95%,end
and alls I wanted to do
was have a good time.

00:22:21.073 --> 00:22:22.374 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>That's called a Bitch Brew.</i>

00:22:22.441 --> 00:22:25.610 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Everybody has a nice
little dainty Lolita glass,

00:22:25.677 --> 00:22:28.180 line:95%,end
and I have like a jug.

00:22:28.246 --> 00:22:29.581 line:95%,end
(laughter)

00:22:29.648 --> 00:22:31.983 line:95%,end
We're having so much fun
at Kelly's house right now.

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:33.418 line:95%,end
You know, we're just relaxing.

00:22:33.485 --> 00:22:35.454 line:95%,end
<i>-We're not bitching.</i>
-(laughter)

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:36.822 line:95%,end
-Ah!
-HOLLY: The truth comes out.

00:22:36.888 --> 00:22:39.591 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: It's just kind of a--
it's a nice evening.

00:22:40.892 --> 00:22:42.961 line:95%,end
<i>Maybe we'll get lucky</i>
<i>and Leslie won't come.</i>

00:22:43.028 --> 00:22:45.230 line:95%,end
I really don't have a problem
with Leslie.

00:22:45.297 --> 00:22:47.032 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Oh, my God, yes, you do.

00:22:47.099 --> 00:22:48.166 line:95%,end
You lie like a rug.

00:22:48.233 --> 00:22:50.836 line:95%,end
KELLY: I just don't like
how Leslie comes in and,

00:22:50.902 --> 00:22:52.637 line:95%,end
like, we have seniority here.

00:22:52.704 --> 00:22:55.140 line:95%,end
<i>Our girls work their butts off every week.</i>

00:22:55.207 --> 00:22:57.676 line:95%,end
And Peyton just walks in
and gets to do a solo.

00:22:57.743 --> 00:22:58.810 line:95%,end
I don't think she earned it.

00:22:58.877 --> 00:22:59.978 line:95%,end
(doorbell)

00:23:00.045 --> 00:23:01.413 line:95%,end
Oh, somebody's here.

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:04.049 line:95%,end
Oh, how are you?

00:23:04.116 --> 00:23:05.517 line:95%,end
It's Leslie.

00:23:05.584 --> 00:23:06.985 line:95%,end
We thought you gave up on us.

00:23:07.052 --> 00:23:08.286 line:95%,end
Well, I did get lost.

00:23:08.353 --> 00:23:09.855 line:95%,end
Whatever, Leslie.

00:23:09.921 --> 00:23:11.790 line:95%,end
-Oh, don't start.
-Whatever.

00:23:11.857 --> 00:23:13.024 line:95%,end
How many drinks have you had?

00:23:13.091 --> 00:23:15.327 line:95%,end
KELLY: Leslie's been fighting
with all the moms this week.

00:23:15.394 --> 00:23:16.995 line:95%,end
So when she came into my party,

00:23:17.062 --> 00:23:18.897 line:95%,end
I wasn't really excited to see her.

00:23:18.964 --> 00:23:20.432 line:95%,end
Are you gonna bully us?

00:23:21.032 --> 00:23:24.169 line:95%,end
Because I feel like every time
we're up in the viewing room...

00:23:24.236 --> 00:23:25.771 line:95%,end
-Yeah?
-...every time we say something,

00:23:25.837 --> 00:23:28.006 line:95%,end
-you're like, jumping down our throats.
-You know I just talk loud.

00:23:28.073 --> 00:23:29.474 line:95%,end
My voice gets loud.

00:23:29.541 --> 00:23:31.376 line:95%,end
It's not bullying. It's how I talk.

00:23:31.443 --> 00:23:33.712 line:95%,end
I'm here to enjoy myself this week

00:23:33.779 --> 00:23:36.314 line:95%,end
and to watch the girls
and enjoy them dance.

00:23:36.381 --> 00:23:38.016 line:95%,end
-And everyone really claims...
-(interposing voices)

00:23:38.083 --> 00:23:39.785 line:95%,end
-KELLY: ...bullied all week.
-I'm loud. I'm loud.

00:23:39.851 --> 00:23:41.853 line:95%,end
I felt like I've been dealing
with it all week. I really don't--

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:44.322 line:95%,end
You told me to shut up
quite a few times.

00:23:44.389 --> 00:23:47.192 line:95%,end
Well, because sometimes
I just wish you would.

00:23:47.259 --> 00:23:48.593 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Well, I wish you would.

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:50.128 line:95%,end
-Okay.
-CHRISTI: I really wish you would.

00:23:50.195 --> 00:23:52.531 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Well, I take bullying
very seriously.

00:23:52.597 --> 00:23:54.599 line:95%,end
And I do too. And I'm not doing it.

00:23:54.666 --> 00:23:56.468 line:95%,end
So I'm just so sick of you guys
accusing me of it.

00:23:56.535 --> 00:23:58.670 line:95%,end
I think what the issue is,
at times, Leslie,

00:23:58.737 --> 00:24:02.441 line:95%,end
is that the tone of what you're saying,
it's very intense.

00:24:02.507 --> 00:24:05.644 line:95%,end
You're sitting here listening
to this woman, this drunk,

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:06.878 line:95%,end
say what she's saying and you're still--

00:24:06.945 --> 00:24:08.547 line:95%,end
Call me a drunk again.

00:24:09.381 --> 00:24:11.983 line:95%,end
I guess I just got a little sick and tired

00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:15.387 line:95%,end
of her constant telling us why
she belongs, why Peyton belongs,

00:24:15.454 --> 00:24:17.189 line:95%,end
why we need to accept her,
why we need to like her.

00:24:20.859 --> 00:24:22.994 line:95%,end
You know what? I have a whole list
of reasons why I don't.

00:24:23.061 --> 00:24:24.396 line:95%,end
<i>And I need to let you know.</i>


00:24:28.166 --> 00:24:30.535 line:5%,start
I can't tell you how many have said
that they have seen you

00:24:30.602 --> 00:24:32.604 line:95%,end
at competitions standing there
with your beer bottle

00:24:32.671 --> 00:24:33.672 line:95%,end
and your cigarette.

00:24:33.738 --> 00:24:36.408 line:95%,end
You are nothing but an intimidating bitch.

00:24:36.475 --> 00:24:40.011 line:95%,end
I don't know if I was pissed that Leslie
had been treating us crappy all week

00:24:40.078 --> 00:24:41.880 line:95%,end
or that she was ruining the party.

00:24:41.947 --> 00:24:44.282 line:95%,end
All I know is I didn't want
to see her face any longer.

00:24:44.716 --> 00:24:45.717 line:95%,end
Shoo.

00:24:48.253 --> 00:24:49.254 line:95%,end
Go away.

00:24:53.492 --> 00:24:54.726 line:95%,end
(crash)

00:24:54.793 --> 00:24:56.061 line:95%,end
Guess what?

00:24:56.127 --> 00:24:57.095 line:95%,end
You got it.

00:24:57.863 --> 00:24:59.464 line:95%,end
(tense music playing)

00:24:59.531 --> 00:25:02.534 line:5%,start
I think we're a really hard group
to be accepted into

00:25:02.601 --> 00:25:06.104 line:95%,end
because we've been together for so long
and we have so much history.

00:25:06.171 --> 00:25:08.507 line:95%,end
-MELISSA: Oh, don't.
-KELLY: Don't cry.

00:25:08.573 --> 00:25:09.975 line:95%,end
Oh, don't.

00:25:10.041 --> 00:25:12.177 line:95%,end
But if you want to be accepted
into the group,

00:25:12.244 --> 00:25:15.413 line:95%,end
stop telling us
everything you hate about us

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.015 line:95%,end
and why our kids are rotten people.

00:25:17.082 --> 00:25:19.251 line:95%,end
It was my party
and I cried if I want to.

00:25:19.317 --> 00:25:20.952 line:95%,end

ABBY: Mackenzie,
no tricks in the lobby.

00:25:39.337 --> 00:25:41.239 line:5%,start
We've arrived in Atlanta, Georgia,

Woohoo!

Oh, I could have worn fancy shoes.

Well, you know what, forest ranger?

Come on. Get over here, Yogi Bear,

00:26:31.656 --> 00:26:33.191 line:95%,end

No, I don't want her to be nervous.
I want her to win.

Abby was blaming me
for stressing Chloe out

00:26:39.564 --> 00:26:42.000 line:5%,start

CHRISTI: What are you doing here?

00:27:01.853 --> 00:27:03.688 line:95%,end
LESLIE: Did you really think
I was gonna allow you guys

00:27:03.755 --> 00:27:04.689 line:95%,end
to intimidate me not to come?

00:27:04.756 --> 00:27:06.424 line:95%,end
I don't think we were trying
to intimidate you.

00:27:06.491 --> 00:27:07.692 line:95%,end

00:27:08.393 --> 00:27:09.728 line:95%,end
LESLIE: Okay, listen.

00:27:09.794 --> 00:27:12.364 line:95%,end
We're here because
when we start something we finish it.

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:13.999 line:95%,end
I don't care what you think.

00:27:14.065 --> 00:27:15.133 line:95%,end

-You're not a member of this team.
-LESLIE: You're wrong.

00:27:17.636 --> 00:27:19.070 line:95%,end

Careful someone doesn't drop
a house on you.

00:27:30.015 --> 00:27:31.750 line:95%,end
I think it's pretty safe to say that,

00:27:31.816 --> 00:27:34.552 line:95%,end

at Leslie,

00:27:34.619 --> 00:27:36.254 line:95%,end

Did Abby forget so quickly that Maddie

00:34:06.744 --> 00:34:09.714 line:95%,end
<i>missed pretty much the same trick</i>
<i>a few weeks ago?</i>

00:34:09.781 --> 00:34:12.850 line:95%,end
And the reaction from Abby
is totally different.

00:34:12.917 --> 00:34:14.685 line:95%,end
-All right, Peyton--
-Let's go.

00:34:14.752 --> 00:34:16.120 line:95%,end
PEYTON: <i>I'm really nervous.</i>

00:34:16.187 --> 00:34:18.756 line:5%,start
I didn't feel I had enough preparation
to learn the solo.

(cheering)

00:35:08.773 --> 00:35:10.741 line:5%,start
I think Peyton did well

00:35:10.808 --> 00:35:12.777 line:5%,start
for her not being properly prepared

00:35:12.844 --> 00:35:14.278 line:95%,end
and not having a lot of rehearsal time.

00:35:14.345 --> 00:35:16.447 line:95%,end
-Good?
-Yeah.

00:35:16.514 --> 00:35:18.282 line:95%,end
Leslie, how was Peyton?

00:35:18.349 --> 00:35:20.284 line:95%,end
LESLIE: She got no practice time, so--

00:35:20.351 --> 00:35:21.919 line:95%,end
You know what, Leslie?
I don't want to hear it.

00:35:21.986 --> 00:35:23.321 line:95%,end
-You asked for the solo...
-LESLIE: She didn't get any.

00:35:23.387 --> 00:35:25.056 line:95%,end
-...we threw it at her.
-She didn't get any practice time.

ABBY: When you got to an audition,
do you get time to go practice on it?

00:35:27.592 --> 00:35:29.393 line:95%,end
No, you learn it right there,
and you do it

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:31.129 line:95%,end
in front of the producers
and the director.

00:35:31.195 --> 00:35:33.731 line:5%,start
All the moms need to zip it.

00:35:33.798 --> 00:35:35.433 line:95%,end
<i>It's my way or the highway.</i>

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:36.968 line:95%,end
And that's the way it's gonna be.

00:35:37.034 --> 00:35:38.269 line:95%,end
And if you don't like it...

00:35:39.137 --> 00:35:40.571 line:95%,end
Kelly, remember
when you came down to the desk

00:35:40.638 --> 00:35:42.807 line:95%,end
and asked me about,
why is Peyton here?

00:35:42.874 --> 00:35:44.175 line:95%,end
No, I didn't ask why she's here.

00:35:44.242 --> 00:35:45.843 line:95%,end
I asked why she was doing a solo.

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:47.912 line:95%,end
I think that the other girls
in the group

00:35:47.979 --> 00:35:49.981 line:95%,end
should have been offered a solo
before Peyton was.

00:35:50.047 --> 00:35:51.616 line:95%,end
LESLIE: All I did was ask.
That's all.

00:35:51.682 --> 00:35:53.885 line:95%,end
We already know that
they don't want us here.

00:35:53.951 --> 00:35:56.687 line:95%,end
<i>So if the group number doesn't do well,</i>

00:35:56.754 --> 00:35:58.089 line:95%,end
I have to be honest,

00:35:58.156 --> 00:36:00.258 line:95%,end
I will feel guilty

00:36:00.324 --> 00:36:02.326 line:95%,end
that they will blame it on Peyton.

00:36:02.393 --> 00:36:06.063 line:95%,end
Do you want to know why the kids
and us don't want Peyton here?

00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:08.199 line:95%,end
Because you bully them.

00:36:08.266 --> 00:36:10.134 line:95%,end
Save your tears for the pillow.

00:36:10.201 --> 00:36:11.903 line:95%,end
Don't talk to me like that.
I'm an adult.

00:36:11.969 --> 00:36:14.071 line:95%,end
Right. So you shouldn't be
sitting here boohooing.

00:36:14.138 --> 00:36:15.606 line:95%,end
And look at those three over there.

00:36:15.673 --> 00:36:18.776 line:95%,end
What in God's name
would you care

00:36:18.843 --> 00:36:20.111 line:95%,end
what they think?

00:36:20.178 --> 00:36:21.145 line:95%,end
Who are they?

00:36:21.212 --> 00:36:22.146 line:95%,end
They are nobody.

00:36:22.213 --> 00:36:23.581 line:95%,end
Just stop.

00:36:23.648 --> 00:36:26.517 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: I really hope that
this is the last we see of Leslie.

00:36:26.584 --> 00:36:28.419 line:5%,start
I mean, she's hard to take.

00:36:29.387 --> 00:36:31.222 line:95%,end
And we've taken a lot of her lately.

00:36:31.289 --> 00:36:33.891 line:95%,end
The last group number we did
at Starbound, you came in 10th.

00:36:33.958 --> 00:36:36.460 line:95%,end
If I'm sitting in that audience
and come in 10th,

00:36:37.395 --> 00:36:40.231 line:95%,end
put supportive shoes on because
you'll be walking back to Pittsburgh.

00:36:40.298 --> 00:36:41.899 line:95%,end
<i>I'm really worried</i>
<i>about this group number.</i>

00:36:41.966 --> 00:36:45.336 line:95%,end
The concept is very interesting
and I love the message

00:36:45.403 --> 00:36:46.571 line:95%,end
<i>they're trying to get across.</i>

00:36:46.637 --> 00:36:48.039 line:95%,end
<i>But will the audience understand it?</i>

00:36:48.105 --> 00:36:49.106 line:95%,end
Who knows.

ANNOUNCER: <i>Next up,</i>

I wasn't even looking
at the girls dancing.

00:37:12.063 --> 00:37:14.599 line:95%,end

(tense music playing)

00:37:53.871 --> 00:37:56.907 line:95%,end
The last time we were at Starbound,
we were 10th.

00:37:56.974 --> 00:37:57.842 line:95%,end
10th?

00:37:57.908 --> 00:37:59.010 line:95%,end
<i>And I was humiliated.</i>

00:37:59.076 --> 00:38:01.512 line:95%,end
<i>And I came back to Starbound</i>
<i>to clear the name</i>

<i>Fourth place,</i>

<i>It's Chloe from Abby Lee Miller Studio--</i>
<i>Dance Studio.</i>

00:38:17.828 --> 00:38:21.565 line:95%,end
I actually thought that Chloe
danced better than fourth place.

00:38:21.632 --> 00:38:23.534 line:95%,end
Do I think that she deserved first?

00:38:23.601 --> 00:38:24.902 line:95%,end
No, I'm not saying that.

00:38:24.969 --> 00:38:27.405 line:95%,end
<i>But I was a little surprised</i>

<i>Maddie from Abby Lee Dance Company!</i>

I was really surprised when they announced
Maddie as first place

00:38:43.854 --> 00:38:47.091 line:5%,start
because she was
in the 9 to 12-year-old category.

00:38:47.158 --> 00:38:48.359 line:95%,end
<i>And she's nine.</i>

00:38:48.426 --> 00:38:50.027 line:95%,end
And she won, I think, by 4 points,

00:38:50.094 --> 00:38:51.962 line:95%,end
which I've never seen at a competition.

Absolutely she wanted
a higher medal.

<i>But you know what?</i>
<i>I'm not gonna break her down.</i>

what she did this weekend.

<i>Step on up, ladies.</i>

00:39:23.794 --> 00:39:26.797 line:95%,end
ABBY: The trio came in fifth
because they did not do a good job.

00:39:26.864 --> 00:39:27.798 line:95%,end
<i>I think they were tired.</i>

00:39:27.865 --> 00:39:29.900 line:95%,end
And it didn't go over
as well as I had hoped.

<i>In my hands right here,</i>

00:39:31.635 --> 00:39:34.672 line:5%,start

-Woo!

00:40:06.604 --> 00:40:08.839 line:95%,end
We got first place overall
for our group dance.

00:40:08.906 --> 00:40:12.176 line:95%,end

00:40:13.644 --> 00:40:16.514 line:95%,end
I don't think you could pull it apart
because you were too busy watching it.

00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:17.715 line:95%,end
It was just pretty.

00:40:17.782 --> 00:40:20.084 line:95%,end
I think we should keep
all of us in the group.

00:40:20.151 --> 00:40:24.054 line:95%,end
And Brooke and I, because this is
the first time I've won with you guys.

Aw.

Yeah, ooh, yeah.

I'm proud of the kids.

They did what they needed to do.

00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:42.406 line:5%,start
And moms, you chased away Cathy.

You chased away Jill.
