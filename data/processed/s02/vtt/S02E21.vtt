00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:17.584 line:5%,start
ABBY: Melissa, I'm taking her over
to the other competition

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.552 line:5%,start
and she's going to do "Cry."

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.089 line:5%,start
KELLY: It's blatantly obvious
that she brought a costume for Maddie,

00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:25.425 line:5%,start
and didn't bring one for Chloe
or Nia or Paige.

00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:27.427 line:5%,start
This is the (bleep) that happens.

00:00:27.494 --> 00:00:31.464 line:5%,start

Fix this hair because it's horrible.

00:00:47.814 --> 00:00:48.948 line:5%,start
-Horrible.
-Why don't you fix your hair

00:00:49.015 --> 00:00:51.184 line:5%,start
and fix your face and your body
and everything else?

00:00:51.251 --> 00:00:53.620 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: <i>She makes sure that Maddie</i>

(tense music playing)

Abby, can I talk to you?

00:01:54.881 --> 00:01:55.782 line:95%,end
-ABBY: Jill--
-Yeah, we had some differences.

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:57.217 line:95%,end
You know what?
I'm right in the middle of...

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:58.118 line:95%,end
-I know.
-...the pyramid.

00:01:58.184 --> 00:01:59.285 line:95%,end
You know how this works.

00:01:59.352 --> 00:02:00.620 line:95%,end
I do know how it works.

00:02:00.687 --> 00:02:02.322 line:95%,end
I made a mistake going to Candy Apples.

00:02:02.388 --> 00:02:03.423 line:95%,end
You guys know that.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:04.390 line:95%,end
KELLY: Are you practicing your death drop?

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:06.025 line:95%,end
JILL: It was a mistake.

00:02:06.092 --> 00:02:09.696 line:95%,end
And I would really like for you
to find a spot for Kendall

00:02:09.762 --> 00:02:11.531 line:95%,end
on this team, like you did once before.
I know--

00:02:11.598 --> 00:02:13.099 line:95%,end
ABBY: Jill, I don't have time
for this today.

00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:15.101 line:95%,end
-I understand that.
-I have solo's, I have a group.

00:02:15.168 --> 00:02:16.402 line:95%,end
We have a competition this weekend.

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:17.337 line:95%,end
I want to be there with you.

00:02:17.403 --> 00:02:19.606 line:95%,end
I--I think that Kendall can fit
right in this group.

00:02:19.672 --> 00:02:20.807 line:95%,end
-ABBY: Kendall--
-JILL: She did it once before.

00:02:20.874 --> 00:02:22.208 line:95%,end
She can do it, again.

00:02:22.275 --> 00:02:24.644 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: I guess Candy Apples
just didn't give Jill what she wanted,

00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:27.013 line:5%,start
you know, a starring role in every number,

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.182 line:5%,start
a featured spot, a special part.

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:31.818 line:95%,end
So here she is, hop, hop, hop, hopping

00:02:31.885 --> 00:02:33.853 line:95%,end
right back to the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.588 line:95%,end
You are off your rocker.

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:37.724 line:95%,end
JILL: All I want
is what's best for Kendall.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.260 line:95%,end
Hey, I wanted
what was best for Kendall,

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:42.028 line:95%,end
and you didn't give me time to do that.

00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:43.796 line:95%,end
-I know I made a mistake.
-ABBY: You should be--

00:02:43.863 --> 00:02:45.098 line:95%,end
-I'll pack my bags...
-ABBY: The reason I did this--

00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:46.533 line:95%,end
...and go home right now.

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.369 line:95%,end
Is that--would that make you guys
all really happy?

00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:51.070 line:95%,end
No. That will not make me happy.

00:02:51.137 --> 00:02:52.272 line:95%,end
Because that's what I'm doing!

00:02:52.338 --> 00:02:54.140 line:95%,end
-ABBY: And you know who's going to lose?
-I'm sick of this (bleep)!

00:02:57.343 --> 00:03:00.346 line:95%,end
Are you going to turn my child away
knowing she's got talent

00:03:00.413 --> 00:03:01.781 line:95%,end
and she belongs in this group?

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:02.916 line:95%,end
I'm in the middle of a rehearsal!

00:03:02.982 --> 00:03:04.083 line:95%,end
Right. You know what? Rehearse.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.885 line:95%,end
I cannot believe this.

00:03:05.952 --> 00:03:07.387 line:95%,end
<i>I am literally speechless.</i>

00:03:07.453 --> 00:03:10.657 line:5%,start
Jill came in with a hot new hairdo

00:03:10.723 --> 00:03:14.294 line:5%,start
and a whole new wardrobe,
but it's still the same old Jill.

00:03:15.762 --> 00:03:17.030 line:95%,end
You know what, Abby?

00:03:17.096 --> 00:03:18.998 line:95%,end
Here. You hold your picture.

00:03:19.065 --> 00:03:21.334 line:95%,end
She deserves to be on that pyramid.

00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:23.069 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>Who walks into pyramid,</i>

00:03:23.136 --> 00:03:25.305 line:5%,start
right in the middle,
and just shoves their kid in there?

00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:27.040 line:95%,end
<i>I think it's totally desperate.</i>

00:03:27.106 --> 00:03:28.174 line:95%,end
-ABBY: Girls!
-JILL: You go on.

00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:31.010 line:95%,end
ABBY: Girls, this is not about friends.

00:03:31.077 --> 00:03:33.413 line:95%,end
Do you want to see Kendall?
Invite her to your house.

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:35.248 line:95%,end
This is my business.

00:03:35.315 --> 00:03:37.183 line:95%,end
Can you find it in your heart
to allow Kendall...

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.918 line:95%,end
-Jill.
-JILL: ...to be a part of this team?

00:03:38.985 --> 00:03:40.853 line:95%,end
Jill, I will be glad to talk to you
at a later date.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:41.754 line:95%,end
Okay.

00:03:41.821 --> 00:03:43.056 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>I am furious with Jill.</i>

00:03:43.122 --> 00:03:45.625 line:95%,end
How she thinks
she's going to walk back in here

00:03:45.692 --> 00:03:47.293 line:95%,end
and get this kid back on the team,

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.996 line:95%,end
<i>it's not this girl's fault.</i>
<i>She's a great dancer.</i>

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:50.997 line:95%,end
<i>Let her rehearse.</i>

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:52.265 line:95%,end
<i>Stick her on the end.</i>

00:03:52.332 --> 00:03:53.399 line:95%,end
<i>It's not a big deal.</i>

00:03:53.466 --> 00:03:56.302 line:95%,end
Now, we're going
to Starpower in Lancaster.

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:59.606 line:95%,end
Not very far, but a big competition.

00:03:59.672 --> 00:04:02.275 line:95%,end
Lots of people from New Jersey
and the New York area

00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:03.910 line:95%,end
will be in attendance.


00:04:03.977 --> 00:04:05.044 line:95%,end
<i>It's a really big deal.</i>

00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:07.580 line:95%,end
They enter 50, 60 numbers.

00:04:07.647 --> 00:04:09.215 line:95%,end
We're going with one group.

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.251 line:95%,end
Moving on to the pyramid--

00:04:11.317 --> 00:04:14.387 line:95%,end
on the bottom of the pyramid,
Mackenzie.

00:04:14.454 --> 00:04:16.389 line:95%,end
When things are done
in "The Contagion"

00:04:16.456 --> 00:04:19.592 line:95%,end
<i>and you do it first</i>
<i>and then Paige and then Nia,</i>

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:20.893 line:95%,end
when you do it so fast,

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.129 line:95%,end
you make Paige and Nia look like
they're off,

00:04:23.196 --> 00:04:25.031 line:95%,end
like they're the ones that are wrong.

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:27.567 line:95%,end
Next, Nia.

00:04:27.634 --> 00:04:30.536 line:95%,end
The area walkover got you into trouble.

00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:32.138 line:95%,end
<i>Don't let it happen again.</i>

00:04:32.205 --> 00:04:33.773 line:95%,end
You need to slow down.

00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:38.878 line:95%,end
Paige, you really didn't do anything wrong
but you're part of the trio,

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:41.547 line:95%,end
so you have to take responsibility for it.

00:04:42.382 --> 00:04:43.750 line:95%,end
Chloe.

00:04:43.816 --> 00:04:47.353 line:95%,end
Chloe, it was good
but you get into those categories

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.355 line:95%,end
with 11 and 12-year-olds,

00:04:49.422 --> 00:04:52.959 line:95%,end
and you never get up there
where I think you belong.

00:04:53.026 --> 00:04:56.296 line:95%,end
Next, I have Brooke.

00:04:56.362 --> 00:04:59.232 line:95%,end
Brooke, you did a great job.

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:00.500 line:95%,end
Your technique was clean.

00:05:00.566 --> 00:05:02.101 line:95%,end
<i>From where I was sitting,</i>

00:05:02.168 --> 00:05:04.671 line:95%,end
<i>I thought your facial expressions</i>
<i>were wonderful.</i>

00:05:04.737 --> 00:05:06.406 line:95%,end
I thought you were outstanding.

00:05:06.472 --> 00:05:09.876 line:95%,end
And on top of the pyramid, Maddie.

00:05:09.942 --> 00:05:11.577 line:95%,end
You went out there in "9:00 to 12:00"

00:05:11.644 --> 00:05:13.813 line:95%,end
and you won at nine years old.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.581 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>Maddie wins all the time,</i>

00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:18.418 line:95%,end
<i>and it's not that we're jealous</i>
<i>of Maddie's victories.</i>

00:05:18.484 --> 00:05:21.754 line:95%,end
<i>I would never rub Chloe's victories</i>

00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:23.056 line:95%,end
<i>in anyone else's faces.</i>

00:05:23.122 --> 00:05:25.992 line:95%,end
If anything, I try to downplay
any kind of success Chloe has

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:28.728 line:95%,end
because you don't want to create
any kind of animosity

00:05:28.795 --> 00:05:30.196 line:95%,end
and tension between these girls.

00:05:30.263 --> 00:05:34.067 line:95%,end
Maddie, you will be doing a solo
this week entitled

00:05:34.133 --> 00:05:36.135 line:95%,end
"I Can't Find the Words."

00:05:36.202 --> 00:05:38.871 line:95%,end
Paige, you also have a solo
this weekend.

00:05:38.938 --> 00:05:40.239 line:95%,end
(applause)

00:05:40.306 --> 00:05:44.110 line:95%,end
Your music is entitled
"Creme de la Creme."

00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:46.612 line:95%,end
KELLY: Paige is getting a solo this week
and I'm very excited.

00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:49.182 line:95%,end
Because I thought after
I changed her last solo,

00:05:49.248 --> 00:05:51.551 line:95%,end
<i>that it would be a while</i>
<i>before Paige got another one.</i>

00:05:51.617 --> 00:05:54.320 line:95%,end
Nia, you have a solo this weekend.

00:05:54.387 --> 00:05:56.189 line:95%,end
(cheering and applause)

00:05:56.255 --> 00:06:01.461 line:95%,end
The music is entitled
"Workin' Girl" by Laquifa.

00:06:01.527 --> 00:06:05.198 line:95%,end
(cheering and applause)

00:06:05.264 --> 00:06:07.367 line:95%,end
SINGER: <i>âªLaquifa,what?âª</i>

00:06:07.433 --> 00:06:08.835 line:95%,end

Five, six--run, Maddie.

You're going this way.

MADDIE: I'm so excited that
Nick's in our group dance

It's cute.

-I think it looks cute.
-...young.

00:07:19.305 --> 00:07:21.207 line:95%,end
When you first walked in the door
I'm like, oh, my God.

-Is that Cathy?
-KELLY: Ew!

00:07:22.642 --> 00:07:23.643 line:95%,end

You have guts, girlfriend.

JILL: <i>I know.</i>

(laughs)

00:07:35.021 --> 00:07:35.988 line:95%,end
I'm just saying,
I thought she'd be like,

00:07:36.055 --> 00:07:37.123 line:95%,end
-yeah, put her at the bottom.
-Really?

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:40.193 line:95%,end
Did you seriously think
that walking in the door

00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:41.394 line:95%,end
and saying to Abby,
put her in the group,

00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:42.428 line:95%,end
would work out in your favor?

00:07:42.495 --> 00:07:44.430 line:95%,end
Because that's unexpected, to me.

00:07:44.497 --> 00:07:45.565 line:95%,end
JILL: <i>She wouldn't talk to me.</i>

00:07:45.631 --> 00:07:47.099 line:95%,end

KELLY: <i>What's there to talk about?</i>

00:07:48.134 --> 00:07:49.502 line:95%,end
She's dancing.

00:07:52.238 --> 00:07:54.507 line:95%,end
Kendall did have an opportunity.

00:07:54.574 --> 00:07:57.477 line:95%,end
She auditioned for our company,
she made it,

00:07:57.543 --> 00:08:00.880 line:95%,end
and Jill blew her top and left.

00:08:00.947 --> 00:08:05.351 line:95%,end
Top, ball change, glissade, Russian.

00:08:05.418 --> 00:08:06.919 line:95%,end

00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:10.456 line:95%,end

<i>Big mistake.</i>

00:08:11.791 --> 00:08:14.927 line:95%,end
Now she thinks,
I'm just going to show up,

00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:16.829 line:95%,end
she's going to put us back on the team.

00:08:16.896 --> 00:08:17.964 line:95%,end
<i>Wrong.</i>

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:19.665 line:95%,end
I'm hoping that you can understand...

00:08:19.732 --> 00:08:20.666 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I do you understand
because I see--

00:08:20.733 --> 00:08:21.567 line:95%,end
...why I left.

00:08:21.634 --> 00:08:22.635 line:95%,end
I couldn't tolerate no--

00:08:22.702 --> 00:08:25.137 line:95%,end
But I have to tell you,
when I saw your daughter do her solo

00:08:25.204 --> 00:08:26.906 line:95%,end
a couple weeks ago,
I was so disappointed

00:08:26.973 --> 00:08:27.940 line:95%,end
-in the choreography.
-I know.

00:08:28.007 --> 00:08:29.709 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>Jill is back for five minutes,</i>

00:08:29.775 --> 00:08:31.444 line:95%,end
<i>and already Melissa</i>
<i>is best friends with her, again.</i>

00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:33.179 line:95%,end
I don't think there's anything honest
about Jill.

00:08:33.246 --> 00:08:36.082 line:95%,end
Now she even lies about her hair color,
not that I ever would.

00:08:36.148 --> 00:08:38.251 line:95%,end
You know what, Kendall?

00:08:38.317 --> 00:08:39.218 line:95%,end
Time has come.

00:08:39.285 --> 00:08:40.453 line:95%,end
You're finished for the night.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.955 line:95%,end
I have a lot of thinking to do.

00:08:43.022 --> 00:08:43.856 line:95%,end

Well, she's not crying.

Jill, stand right over there.

00:09:32.638 --> 00:09:34.240 line:95%,end
I'm going to let her do it again

00:09:42.782 --> 00:09:43.883 line:95%,end
It's ridiculous.

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:45.618 line:95%,end
I don't know how Cathy does it,

00:09:45.685 --> 00:09:47.753 line:95%,end
but we keep working,
working, working, working.

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.522 line:95%,end
And that's what I want for my kid.

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:51.223 line:95%,end

00:09:52.525 --> 00:09:54.226 line:95%,end
Well, you didn't sign anything.

You didn't tell anybody you were here.

00:09:56.062 --> 00:10:00.132 line:95%,end
I think coming into the room
was really inappropriate.

00:10:00.199 --> 00:10:01.701 line:95%,end
I--I didn't have any choice,

00:10:01.767 --> 00:10:02.935 line:95%,end

you would understand that.

00:11:58.384 --> 00:11:59.752 line:95%,end
Hi, how are you?

00:11:59.819 --> 00:12:01.520 line:95%,end
CAROL (over phone):
<i>I just wanted to let you know</i>

00:12:01.587 --> 00:12:04.457 line:95%,end
<i>that after watching all of the auditions,</i>

00:12:04.523 --> 00:12:06.892 line:95%,end
<i>we have decided that</i>
<i>we are going to go with...</i>

00:12:06.959 --> 00:12:09.895 line:95%,end
(suspenseful music playing)


00:12:12.231 --> 00:12:13.365 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>Hello?</i>

00:12:13.432 --> 00:12:15.234 line:95%,end
CAROL (over phone):
<i>Hi. My name is Carol,</i>

00:12:15.301 --> 00:12:17.670 line:95%,end
<i>and I'm the casting director</i>
<i>for</i> Drop Dead Diva.

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:19.438 line:95%,end
ABBY: Hi. How are you?

00:12:19.505 --> 00:12:21.373 line:95%,end
CAROL (over phone):
<i>I just wanted to let you know</i>

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:25.044 line:95%,end
<i>that after watching all of the auditions</i>

00:12:25.111 --> 00:12:27.580 line:95%,end
<i>for the role of Young Deb,</i>

00:12:27.646 --> 00:12:31.450 line:95%,end
<i>we have decided that we</i>
<i>are going to go with Maddie.</i>

00:12:31.517 --> 00:12:33.552 line:95%,end
<i>She did a great, great reading.</i>

00:12:33.619 --> 00:12:35.554 line:95%,end
<i>Her--her dance was beautiful</i>

00:12:35.621 --> 00:12:37.857 line:95%,end
<i>and we thought that she was great.</i>

00:12:37.923 --> 00:12:38.924 line:95%,end
<i>And we decided to go with her.</i>

00:12:38.991 --> 00:12:40.292 line:95%,end
-HOLLY: Something's going on.
-CHRISTI: No.

00:12:40.359 --> 00:12:42.361 line:95%,end
They just said Maddie got <i>Drop Dead Diva.</i>

00:12:42.428 --> 00:12:44.063 line:95%,end
-HOLLY: How do you know?
-Because the kids just told me.

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:45.331 line:95%,end
-Oh.
-ABBY: All right.

00:12:45.397 --> 00:12:47.266 line:95%,end
Super. Thank you so much.

00:12:47.333 --> 00:12:49.702 line:95%,end
And isn't it funny
how they wanted a blonde

00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:52.838 line:95%,end
and she's the only one that auditioned
that wasn't a blonde?

00:12:52.905 --> 00:12:54.874 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: And isn't it funny that
I'm pretty sure that Maddie had that part

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:56.509 line:95%,end
before she even auditioned for it.

00:12:58.410 --> 00:12:59.678 line:95%,end
CAROL (over phone):
<i>Thank you. Have a good day.</i>

00:12:59.745 --> 00:13:00.613 line:95%,end
<i>-I'll talk to you later.</i>
-Okay.

00:13:00.679 --> 00:13:02.882 line:95%,end
-CAROL (over phone): <i>Bye-bye.</i>
-Bye-bye.

00:13:02.948 --> 00:13:04.817 line:95%,end
(screams)

00:13:05.551 --> 00:13:06.619 line:95%,end
Are you excited?

00:13:08.988 --> 00:13:11.524 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>I think all the other girls know</i>

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:13.292 line:95%,end
<i>that it's not a level playing field.</i>

00:13:13.359 --> 00:13:16.228 line:5%,start
So it's no big surprise
when Maddie gets chosen for parts.

00:13:16.295 --> 00:13:17.663 line:95%,end
I think the girls are used to it,

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:19.231 line:95%,end
but they shouldn't have to be.

00:13:19.298 --> 00:13:20.933 line:95%,end
HOLLY: I know how things like this work.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.302 line:95%,end
And it's political and they already have
the ones they wanted.

00:13:23.369 --> 00:13:24.970 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>I don't even know why</i>
<i>they have our kids audition for things.</i>

00:13:25.037 --> 00:13:25.871 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>Because it's real.</i>

00:13:25.938 --> 00:13:28.174 line:95%,end
-It's a real part, so--
-HOLLY: Well, I wouldn't--

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.842 line:95%,end
We just auditioned for the show

00:13:29.909 --> 00:13:31.644 line:95%,end
because Maddie was slated for that part

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:33.279 line:95%,end
before she ever opened her mouth.

00:13:33.345 --> 00:13:36.816 line:5%,start
I always said that that role
had someone's name on it.

00:13:36.882 --> 00:13:39.485 line:95%,end
And in my mind, that child was Maddie.

00:13:39.552 --> 00:13:42.488 line:95%,end
ABBY: Go tell your mom you got the job.

00:13:42.555 --> 00:13:44.323 line:95%,end
Woo-hoo!

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:46.325 line:95%,end
<i>The part goes to Maddie.</i>

00:13:46.392 --> 00:13:47.560 line:5%,start
Is Maddie the best?

00:13:47.626 --> 00:13:48.828 line:5%,start
Who knows.

00:13:48.894 --> 00:13:50.296 line:5%,start
It's not about being the best,

00:13:50.362 --> 00:13:52.731 line:95%,end
it's about being right for the part.

00:13:52.798 --> 00:13:54.400 line:95%,end
(dramatic music playing)

00:13:54.466 --> 00:13:55.701 line:95%,end
Good job, honey!

00:13:55.768 --> 00:13:57.169 line:95%,end
-I'm so proud of you.
-MADDIE: Thank you.

00:13:57.236 --> 00:13:58.838 line:95%,end
-Congratulations.
-I'm so excited.

00:13:59.605 --> 00:14:00.739 line:95%,end
Excited?

00:14:00.806 --> 00:14:02.308 line:95%,end
<i>It's not fair to Maddie.</i>

00:14:02.374 --> 00:14:04.643 line:95%,end
<i>When she gets a job</i>
<i>I want her to be excited.</i>

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:06.645 line:5%,start
If any of the other girls got it,

00:14:06.712 --> 00:14:09.481 line:5%,start
all the moms would be jumping
and screaming and hipping and hollering.

00:14:09.548 --> 00:14:11.784 line:95%,end
But when it's my daughter
they get jealous.

00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:12.918 line:95%,end
Honey, I'm excited for you.

00:14:12.985 --> 00:14:13.953 line:95%,end
Thanks.

00:14:14.019 --> 00:14:16.689 line:95%,end
HOLLY: <i>I'm sure all of your team members</i>
<i>are excited, too, for you.</i>

00:14:16.755 --> 00:14:18.657 line:95%,end
MADDIE: <i>When Miss Abby announced</i>
<i>that I got the part,</i>

00:14:18.724 --> 00:14:21.994 line:5%,start
I was just smiling and I tried
to stay as humble as I could.

00:14:22.061 --> 00:14:25.231 line:95%,end
Because I didn't want to have
my other friends feel bad.

00:14:25.297 --> 00:14:27.132 line:95%,end
I'm proud of you, honey.
Go back into class.

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:28.968 line:95%,end
Good job.

00:14:29.034 --> 00:14:30.336 line:95%,end
-Thank you.
-CHRISTI: Congratulations.

00:14:30.402 --> 00:14:32.972 line:95%,end
<i>I just wish that things</i>
<i>were fair and even.</i>

00:14:33.038 --> 00:14:35.140 line:95%,end
Abby absolutely 100% made sure

00:14:35.207 --> 00:14:37.877 line:95%,end
that Maddie was going to get that role,
come hell or high water.

00:14:40.746 --> 00:14:43.616 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:14:50.589 --> 00:14:51.790 line:95%,end
ABBY: Whoa!

00:14:51.857 --> 00:14:54.159 line:95%,end
I see some bad feet
sitting right there.

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:55.761 line:95%,end
Stop with the hair.

00:14:55.828 --> 00:14:57.496 line:95%,end
It keeps on falling out. Why?

00:14:57.563 --> 00:14:58.631 line:95%,end
Because you have too much hair!

00:14:58.697 --> 00:14:59.965 line:95%,end
Posture.

00:15:00.032 --> 00:15:01.200 line:95%,end
Go.

00:15:01.267 --> 00:15:03.335 line:5%,start
SINGER: <i>âª</i> ...<i>you've lost your faithâª</i>

00:15:03.402 --> 00:15:05.004 line:5%,start
<i>âªThere's nothing more...âª</i>

00:15:06.005 --> 00:15:08.440 line:95%,end
<i>I need to put my best foot forward</i>
<i>at Starpower.</i>

00:15:08.507 --> 00:15:10.376 line:95%,end
<i>I'm going to pull out a winning number.</i>

00:15:10.442 --> 00:15:11.377 line:95%,end
<i>It's about a vampire</i>

00:15:11.443 --> 00:15:15.748 line:95%,end
<i>and little girls that are dreaming</i>
<i>Mr. Right.</i>


00:15:15.814 --> 00:15:17.349 line:95%,end
The number is really cool.

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:20.286 line:95%,end
Let him bite you.
It's okay if you're late.

00:15:22.054 --> 00:15:22.888 line:95%,end
Boom!

00:15:22.955 --> 00:15:24.123 line:95%,end
He's really holding onto that arm.

00:15:24.189 --> 00:15:26.158 line:95%,end
Girls, just make sure you're over there.

00:15:26.225 --> 00:15:28.093 line:95%,end
Abby, I'm going to send her
in rehearsal.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.162 line:95%,end
I wasn't sure what time it was,
so she's here.

00:15:30.229 --> 00:15:31.263 line:95%,end
Go ahead, baby.

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:32.264 line:95%,end
Oh, she's shoving her in, again.

00:15:32.331 --> 00:15:33.165 line:95%,end
-Yup.
-Look at her.

00:15:33.232 --> 00:15:34.266 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Oh, there's Jill!

00:15:34.333 --> 00:15:35.401 line:95%,end
She looks like a different person.

00:15:35.467 --> 00:15:37.102 line:95%,end
She's in the Witness Protection Program.

00:15:37.169 --> 00:15:39.271 line:95%,end
<i>She's trying to escape Cathy.</i>

00:15:39.338 --> 00:15:40.739 line:95%,end
I think I like it the other color better.

00:15:40.806 --> 00:15:43.442 line:95%,end
Jill, when I left here last night
I had two more meetings.

00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:45.010 line:95%,end
You're the one who said
this is where she belongs.

00:15:45.077 --> 00:15:46.946 line:95%,end
ABBY: Okay. You know what?
You--you're interrupting rehearsal.

00:15:47.012 --> 00:15:48.814 line:95%,end
I told you last night it's inappropriate.

00:15:48.881 --> 00:15:50.082 line:95%,end
I don't do it to you.

00:15:50.149 --> 00:15:51.550 line:95%,end
I want you out the door.

00:15:51.617 --> 00:15:52.451 line:95%,end
Go.

00:15:52.518 --> 00:15:54.420 line:95%,end
It's ridiculous.

00:15:54.486 --> 00:15:56.989 line:95%,end
You need some control
over your mother.

00:15:57.056 --> 00:15:57.990 line:95%,end
Yes?

00:15:58.057 --> 00:16:00.259 line:95%,end
I am much more concerned
with the choreography

00:16:00.326 --> 00:16:03.295 line:95%,end
in this routine
than I am with Jill and Kendall.

00:16:03.362 --> 00:16:05.331 line:95%,end
I need to get back into rehearsal

00:16:05.397 --> 00:16:08.367 line:95%,end
and make sure that this routine
is ready to go to Starpower.

00:16:08.434 --> 00:16:09.568 line:95%,end
-MELISSA: Why is she screaming at you?
-CHRISTI: What happened?

00:16:09.635 --> 00:16:11.070 line:95%,end
I didn't know what time
rehearsal was and--

00:16:11.136 --> 00:16:12.137 line:95%,end
MELISSA: What did she say?

00:16:12.204 --> 00:16:13.339 line:95%,end
-She said, get out of here.
-To you?

00:16:13.405 --> 00:16:14.373 line:95%,end
Mm-hmm.

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.976 line:95%,end
ABBY: She is the one
that made you quit to begin with.

00:16:17.042 --> 00:16:19.745 line:95%,end
Your mother's actions,
throwing a shoe in Texas,

00:16:19.812 --> 00:16:22.815 line:95%,end
is why she pulled you
out of this studio.

00:16:22.881 --> 00:16:24.750 line:95%,end
JILL: <i>Despite Abby's behavior,</i>

00:16:24.817 --> 00:16:26.618 line:5%,start
I still want Kendall on this team.

00:16:26.685 --> 00:16:29.321 line:95%,end
I want her to have
these opportunities

00:16:29.388 --> 00:16:31.757 line:95%,end
and to dance every week
at these competitions.

00:16:31.824 --> 00:16:32.791 line:95%,end
ABBY: You didn't want to leave.

00:16:32.858 --> 00:16:34.326 line:95%,end
Now you just want to waltz right back in?

00:16:34.393 --> 00:16:36.028 line:95%,end
Kendall, it doesn't work like that.

00:16:36.095 --> 00:16:38.297 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>Abby has made it very clear</i>
<i>that she likes Kendall,</i>

00:16:38.364 --> 00:16:39.765 line:95%,end
<i>yet she doesn't like Jill.</i>

00:16:39.832 --> 00:16:42.434 line:5%,start
I'm thinking maybe Abby
will let Kendall back on the team

00:16:42.501 --> 00:16:43.836 line:5%,start
just to piss Cathy off,

00:16:43.902 --> 00:16:46.038 line:95%,end
just because she hates Candy Apple
so much.

00:16:47.039 --> 00:16:49.241 line:95%,end
ABBY: Try to pick it up. Get in line.

00:16:49.308 --> 00:16:50.376 line:95%,end
This is ridiculous.

00:16:50.442 --> 00:16:56.615 line:95%,end
SINGER: <i>âªYou cry,</i>
<i>and I want to save you tonightâª</i>

00:16:56.682 --> 00:16:58.283 line:95%,end
ABBY: Get out of the way, Kendall!

00:17:00.419 --> 00:17:01.553 line:95%,end
<i>We're still rehearsing the routine</i>

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:04.323 line:95%,end
with Nick and six girls.

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:08.527 line:95%,end
<i>MacKenzie was not appropriate for this,</i>
<i>certainly, so I let her go.</i>

00:17:08.594 --> 00:17:09.828 line:95%,end
Take your belly out of here.

00:17:09.895 --> 00:17:11.030 line:95%,end
Go to tap.

00:17:11.096 --> 00:17:14.233 line:95%,end
<i>But I have Kendall, who I'm trying</i>
<i>to ignore but I can't ignore.</i>

00:17:15.134 --> 00:17:19.471 line:95%,end
<i>And then I also have Paige and Nia</i>
<i>who are a beat behind,</i>

00:17:19.538 --> 00:17:20.973 line:95%,end
especially Nia.

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.241 line:95%,end
I'm going to cut some people.

00:17:22.908 --> 00:17:24.143 line:95%,end
What do you think, Gianna?

00:17:24.209 --> 00:17:25.411 line:95%,end
I think I would do it smaller.

00:17:25.477 --> 00:17:27.012 line:95%,end
ABBY: Smaller?

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:29.415 line:95%,end
I just feel like Nick's part
is getting lost

00:17:29.481 --> 00:17:31.316 line:95%,end
because there's so much chaos going on.

00:17:31.383 --> 00:17:34.486 line:95%,end
<i>I need to cut this routine</i>
<i>down to three girls and a boy.</i>

00:17:34.553 --> 00:17:36.688 line:95%,end
I'm going to watch each girl
in rehearsal

00:17:36.755 --> 00:17:39.591 line:95%,end
and then make my final decision
at the competition.

00:17:39.658 --> 00:17:42.094 line:95%,end
Okay, Nia, I'm really
on the border with you.

00:17:42.161 --> 00:17:44.229 line:95%,end
I want you to concentrate on your solo.

00:17:44.296 --> 00:17:46.131 line:95%,end
Yes? And you have to do something
with that hair.

00:17:46.198 --> 00:17:48.967 line:95%,end
It's not appropriate.
Every time I look at you it's, like, fun.

00:17:49.034 --> 00:17:51.303 line:95%,end
HOLLY: <i>It's routine that</i>
<i>they don't get picked necessarily</i>

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:52.938 line:95%,end
<i>for a trio or a duet.</i>

00:17:53.005 --> 00:17:54.740 line:95%,end
But now there's a possibility

00:17:54.807 --> 00:17:56.341 line:95%,end
that they will not be picked
for group numbers?

You got to be kidding me.

00:17:57.443 --> 00:18:00.446 line:95%,end
ABBY: Paige, I know
you're a really nice little girl.

00:18:00.512 --> 00:18:02.448 line:95%,end
You're teaching Kendall the number.

00:18:03.649 --> 00:18:05.918 line:95%,end
What happens if I put her
in instead of you?

00:18:05.984 --> 00:18:07.986 line:95%,end
Are you going to feel bad?

00:18:08.053 --> 00:18:10.589 line:95%,end
What if she ends up doing it
better than you?

00:18:10.656 --> 00:18:11.757 line:95%,end
Just saying.

00:18:11.824 --> 00:18:12.991 line:95%,end
I'm just saying.


00:18:15.461 --> 00:18:17.029 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:18:17.096 --> 00:18:21.767 line:95%,end
ABBY: Five, six, seven, eight,
and one, two--

00:18:21.834 --> 00:18:23.869 line:95%,end
oh, lock that back of that knee.

00:18:23.936 --> 00:18:25.537 line:95%,end
We finished? We're good?

00:18:25.604 --> 00:18:26.772 line:95%,end
You think that's it?

00:18:26.839 --> 00:18:28.073 line:95%,end
Okay.

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:31.743 line:95%,end
<i>I've called everybody together</i>
<i>to discuss the </i>Drop Dead Diva part.

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:34.813 line:5%,start
These mothers go on and on
about role models.

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:35.948 line:95%,end
Well, I'll tell you what.

00:18:36.014 --> 00:18:39.051 line:95%,end
Not being happy
for someone else's success--

00:18:39.118 --> 00:18:41.420 line:95%,end
that's the worst role model
you could be.

00:18:41.487 --> 00:18:44.323 line:95%,end
I wanted to talk a little bit
about yesterday,

00:18:44.389 --> 00:18:48.026 line:95%,end
the role for <i>Drop Dead Diva.</i>

00:18:48.994 --> 00:18:53.932 line:95%,end
I don't know if everybody was truly happy
that Maddie got the role.

00:18:53.999 --> 00:18:56.101 line:95%,end
It could have been any one
of the kids that auditioned for it.

00:18:56.168 --> 00:18:58.403 line:95%,end
-We all congratulated Maddie.
-HOLLY: I think that (indistinct)

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:01.373 line:95%,end
The girls all congratulated Maddie.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.175 line:95%,end
I don't know what else you want us to do.

00:19:03.242 --> 00:19:06.678 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>Irony of ironies,</i>
<i>Abby wants to reprimand all of us</i>

00:19:06.745 --> 00:19:08.447 line:95%,end
<i>for not being happy enough for Maddie</i>

00:19:08.514 --> 00:19:10.115 line:95%,end
<i>getting the role on </i>Drop Dead Diva.

00:19:10.182 --> 00:19:12.184 line:5%,start
I wanted to look at her
and say, really, Ab?

00:19:12.251 --> 00:19:14.453 line:5%,start
Because you didn't seem
very happy when Chloe got,

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:15.854 line:95%,end
I don't know, the music video,

00:19:15.921 --> 00:19:17.723 line:95%,end
the Joffrey audition or first place

00:19:17.789 --> 00:19:20.526 line:95%,end
when, you know,
you ran out of the room crying

00:19:20.592 --> 00:19:21.994 line:95%,end
because you were mortified.

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:24.730 line:95%,end
ABBY: Well, Melissa told me
that you said it was rigged.

00:19:24.796 --> 00:19:26.932 line:95%,end
-HOLLY: I'm entitled to my opinion...
-Exactly.

00:19:26.999 --> 00:19:28.967 line:95%,end
...because I'm 42 years old

00:19:29.034 --> 00:19:30.569 line:95%,end
and I'm a free American citizen.

00:19:30.636 --> 00:19:32.704 line:95%,end
So I get to say whatever I want
and believe whatever I want.

00:19:32.771 --> 00:19:35.174 line:95%,end
I stand on my credentials
and my knowledge.

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:36.141 line:95%,end
ABBY: That's fine.

00:19:36.208 --> 00:19:37.709 line:95%,end
Something you can never take away.

00:19:37.776 --> 00:19:41.947 line:95%,end
Then fix this hair
because it's horrible.

00:19:42.014 --> 00:19:43.348 line:95%,end
-Horrible.
-And why don't you fix your hair

00:19:43.415 --> 00:19:45.684 line:95%,end
and fix your face and your body
and everything else?

00:19:45.751 --> 00:19:48.453 line:95%,end
That's fine. When I join
your dance company, I'll do it.

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:50.622 line:95%,end
HOLLY: If we start critiquing people,
let's start with you.

00:19:50.689 --> 00:19:52.357 line:95%,end
Look in the mirror.

00:19:52.424 --> 00:19:55.360 line:95%,end
Holly had to go after me,
you know, go for the jugular.

00:19:55.427 --> 00:19:57.829 line:95%,end
<i>Look in the mirror.</i>
<i>Fix your own body. Fix your own hair.</i>

00:19:57.896 --> 00:19:59.665 line:95%,end
Holly, let's start.

00:19:59.731 --> 00:20:00.966 line:95%,end
Get a padded bra.

00:20:01.033 --> 00:20:02.034 line:95%,end
Don't wear dresses.

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.169 line:95%,end
What else do you want me to tell you. Huh?

00:20:04.236 --> 00:20:05.337 line:95%,end
And, you know what?

00:20:05.404 --> 00:20:07.573 line:95%,end
I got approval for those braids
when I got them put in.

00:20:07.639 --> 00:20:08.941 line:95%,end
Not in--from my dance company, you didn't.

00:20:09.007 --> 00:20:10.175 line:95%,end
-HOLLY: Yes, I did.
-It says right in it...

00:20:10.242 --> 00:20:11.710 line:95%,end
-HOLLY: Yes, I did.
-...do not change your hair color.

00:20:11.777 --> 00:20:13.312 line:95%,end
HOLLY: And, you know what?
I did get approval for it.

00:20:13.378 --> 00:20:15.080 line:95%,end
And this is part of her ethnicity.

00:20:15.147 --> 00:20:17.549 line:95%,end
Well, it's weighing her down.
It's weighing her down.

00:20:17.616 --> 00:20:18.817 line:95%,end
HOLLY: There are four other people
here without a bun.

00:20:18.884 --> 00:20:21.119 line:95%,end
When she--when you made the bun
the last three weeks, Holly,

00:20:21.186 --> 00:20:23.388 line:95%,end
it's like a log coming out
of the side of her head.

00:20:23.455 --> 00:20:25.190 line:95%,end
And on all this, Nia--

00:20:25.257 --> 00:20:29.728 line:95%,end
the lunge, the arch, all of that stuff
is late and sloppy.

00:20:29.795 --> 00:20:31.763 line:95%,end
Your mother thinks you're early.

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:32.831 line:95%,end
You're not.

00:20:33.899 --> 00:20:35.200 line:95%,end
HOLLY: <i>Enough is enough.</i>

00:20:35.267 --> 00:20:37.135 line:5%,start
If you want to fix someone up,
and you you're such,

00:20:37.202 --> 00:20:39.404 line:5%,start
like, a miss fix it, fix yourself.

00:20:39.471 --> 00:20:40.472 line:95%,end
Look at the mirror.

00:20:40.539 --> 00:20:42.774 line:95%,end
Start with the woman in the mirror
and leave my kid alone.

00:20:43.842 --> 00:20:45.010 line:5%,start
(upbeat music playing)

00:20:45.077 --> 00:20:47.746 line:5%,start
ABBY: <i>Ankle, flat back, side,</i>
<i>and up, and then reverse it.</i>

00:20:47.813 --> 00:20:50.182 line:95%,end
Just four, five, six, seven, eight...

00:20:50.249 --> 00:20:51.850 line:95%,end
<i>We're two days away</i>
<i>from the competition,</i>

00:20:51.917 --> 00:20:54.019 line:95%,end
and I've got my hands full.

00:20:54.086 --> 00:20:56.688 line:95%,end
I have the solo rehearsals,
and I still haven't decided

00:20:56.755 --> 00:20:59.424 line:95%,end
who is going to be in the group number
and who isn't.

00:20:59.491 --> 00:21:02.995 line:5%,start
Contestant number blank,
entered in the title division.

00:21:03.061 --> 00:21:05.764 line:95%,end
(ballad music playing)

00:21:05.831 --> 00:21:09.334 line:95%,end
MADDIE: <i>This week I have a lyrical solo</i>
<i>called "I Can't Find the Words."</i>

00:21:09.401 --> 00:21:11.069 line:5%,start
And they're excited for it

00:21:11.136 --> 00:21:12.971 line:5%,start
because I have to write and love note.

00:21:13.038 --> 00:21:16.842 line:95%,end
But I know over here
there's some slamming, angry, boom,

00:21:16.908 --> 00:21:18.377 line:95%,end
look back, da, da, da, da, da.

00:21:18.443 --> 00:21:21.079 line:95%,end
That should be angry
and mad and frustrated.


00:21:21.146 --> 00:21:24.416 line:5%,start
MELISSA: It's basically just saying
that she loves someone

00:21:24.483 --> 00:21:27.653 line:5%,start
but she doesn't know how
to find the words to write it down.

00:21:27.719 --> 00:21:29.021 line:95%,end
So it's a really beautiful number.

00:21:29.087 --> 00:21:31.223 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>I need to see</i>
<i>that big, beaming smile,</i>

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:34.826 line:95%,end
the same big smile
I need to see if you win.

00:21:34.893 --> 00:21:36.728 line:95%,end
Beaming, happy!

00:21:36.795 --> 00:21:39.931 line:95%,end
I don't want Maddie to be affected
by all this <i>Drop Dead Diva</i> drama.

00:21:39.998 --> 00:21:42.234 line:95%,end
Get you to make this bigger.

00:21:42.301 --> 00:21:43.568 line:95%,end
<i>The truth is...</i>

00:21:43.635 --> 00:21:45.237 line:95%,end
Yes, thank you.

00:21:45.304 --> 00:21:49.308 line:95%,end
...jealousy and success
go hand in hand.

00:21:49.374 --> 00:21:51.143 line:95%,end
Maddie needs to get used to it

00:21:51.209 --> 00:21:53.211 line:95%,end
because she's going to be successful.

00:21:55.647 --> 00:21:56.982 line:95%,end
I need the girls to come in.

00:21:57.049 --> 00:21:58.350 line:95%,end
I need everybody to come in.

00:21:58.417 --> 00:22:00.952 line:95%,end
But I need you to get your crowns

00:22:01.019 --> 00:22:01.987 line:95%,end
and get them on that table.

00:22:02.054 --> 00:22:03.555 line:95%,end
<i>I even had her bring her crowns in.</i>

00:22:03.622 --> 00:22:04.956 line:95%,end
<i>Because I want her to realize</i>

00:22:05.023 --> 00:22:06.858 line:95%,end
<i>that this is something to be proud of.</i>

00:22:06.925 --> 00:22:08.393 line:95%,end
<i>it's a huge accomplishment.</i>

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:10.295 line:95%,end
<i>And Starpower is proud of her.</i>

00:22:10.362 --> 00:22:13.165 line:95%,end
<i>She is a little star right now.</i>

00:22:13.231 --> 00:22:14.132 line:95%,end
<i>She's the winner.</i>

00:22:14.199 --> 00:22:15.567 line:95%,end
<i>Own it. Be proud.</i>

00:22:15.634 --> 00:22:17.803 line:95%,end
Rub it in their faces if you have to.

00:22:17.869 --> 00:22:21.239 line:95%,end
This is a piece of metal

00:22:21.306 --> 00:22:24.643 line:95%,end
and two combs and some rhinestones.

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:26.945 line:95%,end
This does not make you a winner.

00:22:27.012 --> 00:22:28.714 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: What, was she saying
how many crowns have you won?

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:29.815 line:95%,end
Oh.

00:22:29.881 --> 00:22:31.149 line:95%,end
Right. This is the best--

00:22:31.216 --> 00:22:32.718 line:95%,end
Let me bring these
and rub them in your face.

00:22:32.784 --> 00:22:33.752 line:95%,end
Exactly.

00:22:33.819 --> 00:22:35.554 line:95%,end
ABBY: These are recent.

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:36.988 line:95%,end
This is Petite Miss Dance?

00:22:37.556 --> 00:22:38.790 line:95%,end
That was a toughie.

00:22:38.857 --> 00:22:41.326 line:95%,end
KELLY: But, once again,
you can't win a crown

00:22:41.393 --> 00:22:43.228 line:95%,end
if you're never sent to go.

00:22:43.295 --> 00:22:44.296 line:95%,end
Starbound.

00:22:44.363 --> 00:22:45.430 line:95%,end
Ooh, that's pretty.

00:22:45.497 --> 00:22:46.832 line:95%,end
Energy.

00:22:46.898 --> 00:22:47.866 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: And Maddie still wins,

00:22:47.933 --> 00:22:49.301 line:95%,end
just because she has
better choreography.

00:22:49.368 --> 00:22:51.970 line:95%,end
And Abby makes sure of that
every week.

00:22:52.037 --> 00:22:53.905 line:95%,end
She makes sure that Maddie
has the best choreography

00:22:53.972 --> 00:22:55.107 line:95%,end
out of this group.

00:22:55.173 --> 00:22:57.542 line:95%,end
And you can sit here and get mad at me,
but you know it's true.

00:22:58.810 --> 00:22:59.678 line:95%,end
HOLLY: There's no question.

00:22:59.745 --> 00:23:00.679 line:95%,end
ABBY: DEA.

00:23:00.746 --> 00:23:02.481 line:95%,end
Oh, running out of room.

00:23:02.547 --> 00:23:05.250 line:95%,end
MADDIE: <i>I didn't wanted to show</i>
<i>all the crowns to the girls,</i>

00:23:05.317 --> 00:23:07.519 line:95%,end
<i>but I followed the rules and I did it.</i>

00:23:07.586 --> 00:23:10.722 line:95%,end
But then the moms kind of got mad,
and I didn't like that at all.

00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:12.691 line:95%,end
But, Melissa,
why would you bring them?

00:23:12.758 --> 00:23:14.559 line:95%,end
MELISSA: She told me to.
And they called me this morning--

00:23:14.626 --> 00:23:15.894 line:95%,end
KELLY: But when she tells you
to bring them, say

00:23:15.961 --> 00:23:17.229 line:95%,end
no, my daughter's uncomfortable...

00:23:17.295 --> 00:23:19.765 line:95%,end
-MELISSA: She is uncomfortable.
-...doing this in front of her friends.

00:23:20.766 --> 00:23:22.534 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Your kid is uncomfortable.

00:23:22.601 --> 00:23:23.902 line:95%,end
KELLY: But you're getting them out now,
Melissa.

00:23:23.969 --> 00:23:24.836 line:95%,end
They already did it.

00:23:24.903 --> 00:23:26.238 line:95%,end
I'm not getting them out.

00:23:26.304 --> 00:23:27.839 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Are you going to tattle on us?

00:23:27.906 --> 00:23:29.641 line:95%,end
MELISSA:
Yeah. I'm going to go tattle on you.

00:23:29.708 --> 00:23:31.643 line:95%,end
HOLLY: I wouldn't be surprised.

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:33.545 line:95%,end
ABBY: You need to get these set up

00:23:33.612 --> 00:23:36.515 line:95%,end
so that you put a sticker
on the back of these.

00:23:36.581 --> 00:23:38.049 line:95%,end
Girls, I just want to tell you,

00:23:38.116 --> 00:23:40.051 line:95%,end
I don't want you to think that
Maddie's doing this

00:23:40.118 --> 00:23:41.253 line:95%,end
to make you feel bad.

00:23:41.319 --> 00:23:43.388 line:95%,end
Maddie was instructed to do this.

00:23:43.455 --> 00:23:45.991 line:95%,end
And I see your faces,
and I feel really bad.

00:23:46.057 --> 00:23:47.526 line:95%,end
ABBY: I'm sick of hearing it.

00:23:47.592 --> 00:23:50.328 line:95%,end
And you are taking her successes
and you're squashing them down.

00:23:50.395 --> 00:23:53.732 line:95%,end
She has a right to jump up
and scream and yell and be excited.

00:23:53.799 --> 00:23:54.933 line:95%,end
It's ridiculous.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.836 line:95%,end
If you want a crown, work for it.

00:23:57.903 --> 00:24:00.005 line:95%,end

Melissa doesn't own the studio.

You actually accused me

Are you kidding me?

my kid's going to get a bow

00:33:49.794 --> 00:33:51.562 line:95%,end

Okay. Well, don't tape her.

You're not in the dance.

But, you know what?

00:35:06.003 --> 00:35:09.006 line:95%,end
I can't risk her injuring herself
any further.

All right. We have Paige out
by default with an injury.

00:38:45.022 --> 00:38:48.359 line:95%,end
Congratulations!

00:38:48.426 --> 00:38:49.994 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Isn't it awesome?

00:38:50.061 --> 00:38:52.963 line:95%,end
Once again,
I think I proved I was right.

00:38:54.098 --> 00:38:56.267 line:95%,end
Jill, nothing to say?

00:38:56.334 --> 00:38:57.401 line:95%,end
No last remarks?

00:38:58.202 --> 00:38:59.036 line:95%,end
Not really.

00:38:59.103 --> 00:39:02.106 line:95%,end
Bottom line, Abby's dancers won.

00:39:02.173 --> 00:39:05.409 line:95%,end
And that is exactly why
I need my daughter

00:39:05.476 --> 00:39:07.478 line:95%,end
to be at Abby Lee Miller's dance company.

00:39:07.545 --> 00:39:08.913 line:95%,end
ABBY: You stick a bow in your kid's hair

00:39:08.979 --> 00:39:10.881 line:95%,end
and think they're going to go on stage
and be in a competition number?

00:39:10.948 --> 00:39:12.583 line:95%,end
JILL: That's not why I put
the bow in her hair, Abby.

00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:13.884 line:95%,end
It's just not that easy.

00:39:13.951 --> 00:39:15.319 line:95%,end
I know what I'm doing.

00:39:15.386 --> 00:39:16.253 line:95%,end
When the time is right--

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:18.322 line:95%,end
Well, how about then you let me know?

00:39:18.389 --> 00:39:21.659 line:95%,end
I won't be back until you let me know
when the time is right.

00:39:21.726 --> 00:39:23.127 line:95%,end
I told you before that
I would think about it.

00:39:23.194 --> 00:39:24.195 line:95%,end
Sh, sh.

00:39:24.261 --> 00:39:25.262 line:95%,end
Did you shush me?

00:39:25.329 --> 00:39:26.163 line:95%,end
Yes, I did.

00:39:28.032 --> 00:39:30.935 line:95%,end
When the time is right for you,
if we're still available,

00:39:31.001 --> 00:39:34.205 line:95%,end
you contact me and you say,
okay, I would like for Kendall...

00:39:34.271 --> 00:39:35.139 line:95%,end
No. I don't call students.

00:39:35.206 --> 00:39:36.340 line:95%,end
-JILL: ...to be a student.
-I don't solicit students.

00:39:36.407 --> 00:39:37.575 line:95%,end
Okay. Then I don't--
then what do you want?

00:39:37.641 --> 00:39:40.978 line:95%,end
Abby knew all along
that she was not going to allow Kendall

00:39:41.045 --> 00:39:42.480 line:95%,end
to dance in that group number.

00:39:42.546 --> 00:39:44.448 line:95%,end
<i>I realize that Abby is a punisher</i>

00:39:44.515 --> 00:39:46.283 line:95%,end
<i>and she punished Kendall and I.</i>

00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:48.252 line:95%,end
What you say goes.
You don't care about the kids.

00:39:48.319 --> 00:39:50.087 line:95%,end
You don't care about anybody
but yourself.

00:39:50.821 --> 00:39:53.691 line:95%,end
-That's terrible.
-Why would I be in this business

00:39:53.758 --> 00:39:55.426 line:95%,end
if I didn't care about their futures?

00:39:55.493 --> 00:39:56.727 line:95%,end
JILL: Well, then why don't you care
about this one's?

00:39:56.794 --> 00:39:57.828 line:95%,end
You're the one that screwed her up!

00:39:57.895 --> 00:39:59.063 line:95%,end
If you think that I own a dance studio--

00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:01.265 line:95%,end
JILL: You know what?
I really want you to be quiet.

00:40:01.332 --> 00:40:02.800 line:95%,end
-I don't care what you think.
-You know what?

00:40:02.867 --> 00:40:04.201 line:95%,end
Who do you think you are?

00:40:04.268 --> 00:40:06.804 line:95%,end
JILL: Who do you think you are,
hurting a little child?

00:40:06.871 --> 00:40:10.441 line:95%,end
You people all suck,
every one of you.

00:40:10.508 --> 00:40:12.543 line:95%,end
You're being insane!

00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:13.511 line:95%,end
I'm insane?

00:40:13.577 --> 00:40:15.913 line:95%,end
Melissa is the only one
who ever comes to her aid.

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:18.482 line:95%,end
What is wrong with you people?

00:40:18.549 --> 00:40:21.819 line:95%,end
They have learned from Abby,
the biggest bully in the block.

00:40:21.886 --> 00:40:23.254 line:95%,end
<i>And now they're bullying, too.</i>

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:26.023 line:95%,end
This is going cost me a lot of money
in therapy.

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:27.091 line:5%,start
ABBY: Stop. Stop.

00:40:27.158 --> 00:40:28.926 line:5%,start
-This is not worth it.
-Because she's embarrassed!

00:40:28.993 --> 00:40:31.195 line:5%,start
-She's mortified of your behavior!
-JILL: She's humiliated!

00:40:31.262 --> 00:40:33.631 line:5%,start
I think Jill is having a mid-life crisis.

00:40:33.697 --> 00:40:35.933 line:5%,start
Kendall should come to class.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.602 line:5%,start
-JILL: She did.
-ABBY: It starts in class, Jill.

00:40:38.669 --> 00:40:42.840 line:5%,start
JILL: <i>Abby's acting like</i>
<i>a total immature baby,</i>

00:40:42.907 --> 00:40:46.911 line:5%,start
and I'm not going to let this happen again
to my child and I.

00:40:46.977 --> 00:40:48.946 line:5%,start
<i>She's just sick.</i>

00:40:49.013 --> 00:40:51.048 line:5%,start
I can't believe I'm sitting here

00:40:51.115 --> 00:40:52.783 line:5%,start
and that woman walked out, again.

00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:54.285 line:5%,start
(laughs)
