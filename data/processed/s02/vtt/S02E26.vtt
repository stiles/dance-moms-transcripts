We are on our way.

00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:16.082 line:5%,start
Maddie is doing a solo this weekend.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:18.218 line:5%,start
Abby's gonna tell you you're doing a solo,

Maddie, do you get it?

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:25.959 line:5%,start
Do you understand why
I wanted you to do your solo?

00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:29.095 line:5%,start
Paige hurts her foot.

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:29.996 line:5%,start

who is dancing at nationals.

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:38.171 line:5%,start
Do I have a solo?

00:00:38.238 --> 00:00:39.606 line:5%,start
I'm just not sure yet.

00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:40.507 line:5%,start
Toughen up.

00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:42.842 line:5%,start
You're going to go to an audition
and not get picked someday.

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:44.010 line:5%,start
While I'm out here in LA,

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:46.780 line:5%,start
we want to record Brooke's
song professionally,

<i>Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears</i>

All right, ladies, this week,

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.230 line:95%,end

But I want to talk about
the iHollywood competition.

00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:46.339 line:95%,end
You are not focused on that competition.

00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:49.008 line:95%,end
Hey, guys, I need everybody dressed.

00:01:49.075 --> 00:01:51.811 line:95%,end
I haven't even said who's in the dance
and who isn't in the dance.

00:01:51.878 --> 00:01:55.014 line:95%,end
And I want to compliment
each and every one of you

00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:58.318 line:95%,end
on that little girl, Nicaya
that came to our studio.

00:01:58.384 --> 00:02:00.487 line:95%,end
<i>I want everyone to notice this pyramid,</i>

00:02:00.553 --> 00:02:04.624 line:5%,start
that there's no Kaya
and no little Nicaya.

00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:05.792 line:95%,end
You were all friendly.

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:08.628 line:95%,end
You all behaved like
nice, young ladies.

00:02:09.262 --> 00:02:11.831 line:95%,end
You guys, I don't know
what happened.

00:02:11.898 --> 00:02:15.502 line:95%,end
You don't know a thing, (bleep).

00:02:15.568 --> 00:02:16.469 line:95%,end
Uh, beat it, (bleep).

00:02:16.536 --> 00:02:18.605 line:95%,end
Don't let the door hit you
on the way out then.

00:02:18.671 --> 00:02:20.140 line:95%,end
Thank you, moms.

00:02:20.206 --> 00:02:22.675 line:95%,end
They've run off another potential student.

00:02:22.742 --> 00:02:24.711 line:95%,end
Let's put iHollywood behind us.

00:02:24.777 --> 00:02:26.579 line:95%,end
We are moving on to the pyramid.

00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:28.114 line:95%,end
On the bottom of the pyramid...

00:02:30.016 --> 00:02:30.850 line:95%,end
Kendall,

00:02:30.917 --> 00:02:32.318 line:95%,end
you're back on the team.

00:02:32.385 --> 00:02:33.419 line:95%,end
That's where you have to start.

00:02:34.187 --> 00:02:36.356 line:95%,end
I thought you were outstanding
in the group routine.

00:02:36.422 --> 00:02:38.558 line:95%,end
(applause)

00:02:42.362 --> 00:02:44.898 line:95%,end
It's those shoulders,
the technique,

00:02:44.964 --> 00:02:47.033 line:95%,end
everything that has to
continue to improve.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.736 line:5%,start
I tried my hardest
to get back on this team,

00:02:49.802 --> 00:02:51.137 line:95%,end
<i>but I'm also sad</i>

00:02:51.204 --> 00:02:55.008 line:95%,end
because I don't think it's fair
that I have to be last on pyramid.

00:02:55.074 --> 00:02:55.909 line:95%,end
ABBY: Next.

00:02:57.243 --> 00:02:59.712 line:95%,end
Paige, you're coming off an injury.

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:01.114 line:95%,end
You did the group routine.

00:03:01.614 --> 00:03:03.116 line:95%,end
I thought you did very well.

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:06.553 line:95%,end
(dramatic music playing)

00:03:08.154 --> 00:03:10.123 line:95%,end
You should be 100% by this week.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.624 line:95%,end
You need to dance full out.

00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:13.459 line:95%,end
Paige hasn't done a solo in weeks.

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:16.563 line:95%,end
<i>She needs to get out on that stage</i>
<i>and start dancing again.</i>

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:18.398 line:95%,end
Come on, Paige,
show me what you have.

00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:22.602 line:95%,end
And next, Brooke.

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:23.903 line:95%,end
You were in a group dance

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.941 line:95%,end
and you did not finish the routine in time
with everybody else.

00:03:28.007 --> 00:03:30.577 line:95%,end
And next, we have Maddie.

00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:34.881 line:95%,end
Maddie, in the group dance,
you just kind of blended in.

00:03:34.948 --> 00:03:36.549 line:95%,end
A dancer like you

00:03:36.616 --> 00:03:38.952 line:95%,end
should stand out amongst the crowd.

00:03:39.018 --> 00:03:41.054 line:95%,end
<i>Maddie was at the bottom row,</i>

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.623 line:5%,start
so it is what it is.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:44.757 line:5%,start
What are you going to do?

00:03:44.824 --> 00:03:47.260 line:95%,end
Moving up the ladder, Nia.


00:03:47.327 --> 00:03:48.962 line:95%,end
You were given something different.

00:03:49.028 --> 00:03:51.898 line:95%,end
The music was very difficult
for me to choreograph to.

00:03:51.965 --> 00:03:54.100 line:95%,end
It was also difficult to dance to.

00:03:54.167 --> 00:03:55.702 line:95%,end
I thought you handled it really well.

00:03:55.768 --> 00:03:58.771 line:95%,end
(gentle music playing)

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:04.544 line:95%,end
Your big problem
is the technique,

00:04:04.611 --> 00:04:06.246 line:95%,end
so you need to step it up, babe.

00:04:06.546 --> 00:04:08.781 line:95%,end
Next, Chloe.

00:04:09.115 --> 00:04:11.084 line:95%,end
Chloe, you made the top five.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.085 line:95%,end
I want number one.

00:04:12.151 --> 00:04:13.720 line:95%,end
You need to be consistent.

00:04:13.786 --> 00:04:14.654 line:95%,end
You came out.

00:04:14.721 --> 00:04:17.323 line:95%,end
You did two turns
and bobbled all over the place.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.325 line:95%,end
<i>This is the week before nationals,</i>

00:04:19.392 --> 00:04:23.296 line:95%,end
so now I'm feeling pressure
to do really good.

00:04:23.363 --> 00:04:26.232 line:95%,end
On top of the pyramid is Mackenzie.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.470 line:95%,end
Mackenzie was third overall
high scorer in her division,

00:04:30.536 --> 00:04:32.305 line:95%,end
so that put her on top of the pyramid,

00:04:32.372 --> 00:04:33.806 line:95%,end
and I was very proud of you.

00:04:33.873 --> 00:04:36.376 line:95%,end
MELISSA: <i>Mackenzie's on the top</i>
<i>of the pyramid this week.</i>

00:04:36.442 --> 00:04:37.610 line:95%,end
She's very excited

00:04:37.677 --> 00:04:39.412 line:95%,end
because it doesn't happen
very often for her.

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:41.347 line:95%,end
So she's really tickled.

00:04:41.714 --> 00:04:45.618 line:95%,end
This week, we will be attending
In10sity Dance Competition.

00:04:45.685 --> 00:04:49.422 line:95%,end
This is the competition that determines

00:04:49.489 --> 00:04:51.491 line:95%,end
who is dancing at nationals.

00:04:51.557 --> 00:04:53.192 line:95%,end
<i>This is a really big week for us.</i>

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:55.662 line:95%,end
I need to figure out
what's going to nationals,

00:04:55.728 --> 00:04:59.999 line:95%,end
so I proceed to announce the new
routines for In10sity Dance.

00:05:00.066 --> 00:05:01.801 line:95%,end
Mackenzie, you are doing a solo.

00:05:01.868 --> 00:05:03.303 line:95%,end
(applause)

00:05:03.369 --> 00:05:07.206 line:95%,end
ABBY:
It's called "A Perfect Day in the Sun."

00:05:07.707 --> 00:05:12.045 line:95%,end
Chloe, you will be doing another
contemporary lyrical routine

00:05:12.111 --> 00:05:13.179 line:95%,end
entitled "Ghost."

00:05:14.047 --> 00:05:16.482 line:95%,end
And Paige, you have a solo also.

00:05:16.549 --> 00:05:18.618 line:95%,end
(cheering and applause)

00:05:18.685 --> 00:05:21.220 line:95%,end
Kendall, you will be doing a solo.

00:05:21.788 --> 00:05:25.158 line:95%,end
The name of your is "Kiss Kiss."

00:05:25.758 --> 00:05:29.195 line:95%,end
Nia, we're changing it up again for you.

00:05:29.262 --> 00:05:31.898 line:95%,end
You're going to be doing
a '60s-inspired number.

00:05:31.964 --> 00:05:33.266 line:95%,end
And Brooke,

00:05:34.634 --> 00:05:36.703 line:95%,end
you're going to have to get
your butt up in the air.

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:39.539 line:95%,end
The name of your solo is "Fly."

00:05:39.605 --> 00:05:42.008 line:95%,end
So all of your aerial work
needs to be in there.

00:05:44.911 --> 00:05:48.414 line:95%,end
I see Melissa out of the corner
of my eye going...

00:05:48.481 --> 00:05:49.515 line:95%,end
(soft voice)
"Maddie, get your hand up."

00:05:49.582 --> 00:05:51.150 line:95%,end
<i>Maddie, get your hand.</i>
<i>Raise your hand.</i>

00:05:51.217 --> 00:05:53.353 line:95%,end
Melissa, butt out.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.555 line:95%,end
Do I have a solo?

00:05:55.621 --> 00:05:57.023 line:95%,end
<i>I know darn well</i>

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.759 line:95%,end
that Maddie is one of the
strongest dancers on my team

00:05:59.826 --> 00:06:01.728 line:95%,end
and that she should be doing a solo.

00:06:01.794 --> 00:06:02.762 line:95%,end
<i>But you know what?</i>

00:06:02.829 --> 00:06:04.364 line:95%,end
I can't give her one.

00:06:04.764 --> 00:06:06.599 line:95%,end
Maddie, I'm not hurting your feelings.

00:06:06.666 --> 00:06:08.368 line:95%,end
She has to want it.

00:06:08.434 --> 00:06:11.904 line:95%,end
Maddie has to come to me
and beg for that solo back.

00:06:11.971 --> 00:06:14.874 line:95%,end
But I have a bunch of other kids
that want to do solos.

00:06:14.941 --> 00:06:16.609 line:95%,end
She wants to do a solo very bad.

00:06:16.676 --> 00:06:19.145 line:95%,end
I understand that,
but you interrupted her

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:20.513 line:95%,end
and wanted her not to do it

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.482 line:95%,end
because you were afraid
of losing all your friends.

00:06:22.548 --> 00:06:24.617 line:95%,end
MELISSA: <i>It was really hard</i>
<i>to see Maddie's face.</i>

00:06:24.684 --> 00:06:27.353 line:95%,end
I'm the one that didn't let her
do a solo a few weeks ago.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.389 line:95%,end
Abby's gonna tell you you're doing a solo,
and you're not.

00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:33.726 line:95%,end
<i>And I'm not trying to speak</i>
<i>for my children,</i>

00:06:33.793 --> 00:06:36.062 line:95%,end
but it's very hard
when you see your child cry.

00:06:36.662 --> 00:06:37.764 line:95%,end
ABBY:
Maddie, toughen up.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.299 line:95%,end
You're going to go to an audition
and not get picked some day.

00:06:40.366 --> 00:06:41.234 line:95%,end
Get it?

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.336 line:95%,end
And you need to stand there
with a smile on your face.

00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:44.937 line:95%,end
<i>Everything for nationals</i>

00:06:45.004 --> 00:06:47.173 line:5%,start
rests on how they perform this week.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.209 line:95%,end
And I, at this point,
I feel so sad for Maddie

00:06:50.276 --> 00:06:52.378 line:95%,end
<i>because she's upset that</i>
<i>she doesn't have a solo,</i>

00:06:52.445 --> 00:06:55.782 line:95%,end
and then she's dealing with like
Abby's pent up frustration

00:06:55.848 --> 00:06:57.450 line:95%,end
<i>that she's no longer her favorite.</i>

00:06:57.517 --> 00:06:58.651 line:95%,end
All right.

00:06:58.718 --> 00:07:00.920 line:95%,end
Moms, you're dismissed.

00:07:00.987 --> 00:07:01.988 line:95%,end
Ladies, spread apart.

00:07:02.054 --> 00:07:03.589 line:95%,end
Let's start warming up.

00:07:03.656 --> 00:07:05.591 line:95%,end
Reach towards the mirror. Arch.

00:07:05.658 --> 00:07:08.761 line:95%,end
Two, three, four.

00:07:08.828 --> 00:07:10.863 line:95%,end
Nationals is next week,

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.400 line:95%,end
so to prepare,
I'm giving each one of the girls a solo

00:07:14.467 --> 00:07:16.202 line:95%,end
at In10sity Dance Competition.

00:07:16.836 --> 00:07:18.871 line:95%,end
<i>Well, almost everybody.</i>

00:07:18.938 --> 00:07:20.773 line:95%,end
Maddie was trying to fight back the tears,

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.842 line:95%,end
but she just couldn't, you know.

00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:25.445 line:95%,end
KELLY: But why was she crying,
just because she didn't get a solo?

00:07:25.511 --> 00:07:27.380 line:95%,end
Yeah. I mean, because
everybody has a solo.

00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:28.815 line:95%,end
-And when your--
-Melissa, my kids

00:07:28.881 --> 00:07:30.750 line:95%,end
-never have a solo, ever.
-I know, but if--

00:07:30.817 --> 00:07:34.687 line:95%,end
Kelly, if you're all--if everybody
got a solo except your daughter,


00:07:34.754 --> 00:07:35.988 line:95%,end
you don't think she would be hurt?

00:07:36.055 --> 00:07:39.459 line:95%,end
If my kid goes up and raises
her hand and asks for a solo,

00:07:39.525 --> 00:07:40.526 line:95%,end
is she going to give her one?

00:07:40.593 --> 00:07:41.727 line:95%,end
Mm-hmm.

00:07:41.794 --> 00:07:42.728 line:95%,end
-No.
-CHRISTI: No.

00:07:42.795 --> 00:07:44.797 line:95%,end
No! So why does it work that way?

00:07:44.864 --> 00:07:46.098 line:95%,end
-Because my kids would like...
-But she can get--

00:07:46.165 --> 00:07:47.533 line:95%,end
to have a solo every week, too.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.168 line:95%,end
It gets to work that way for Maddie.

00:07:49.235 --> 00:07:51.771 line:5%,start
When Brooke was little,
she used to be the favorite.

00:07:51.838 --> 00:07:54.106 line:5%,start
She used to be the "Maddie" of the group.

00:07:54.173 --> 00:07:56.576 line:95%,end
<i>And this is how Abby works.</i>

00:07:56.642 --> 00:07:59.312 line:95%,end
She finds somebody
that's young and amazing,

00:07:59.378 --> 00:08:01.047 line:95%,end
<i>and then once they win it all</i>

00:08:01.113 --> 00:08:04.217 line:95%,end
and they start losing the ambition,
because she burns them out,

00:08:04.283 --> 00:08:05.685 line:95%,end
she moves on to somebody else.

00:08:06.219 --> 00:08:09.555 line:95%,end
Mackenzie, you only have four days
to learn this solo.

00:08:09.622 --> 00:08:11.190 line:95%,end
You need to step it up. Get it?

00:08:12.258 --> 00:08:15.061 line:95%,end
All right. So it's called
"A Perfect Day in the Sun."

00:08:15.127 --> 00:08:16.929 line:95%,end
Mackenzie has a darling little solo.

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:19.098 line:95%,end
I just hope she can remember.

00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:20.433 line:95%,end
And go.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.400 line:95%,end
<i>Chaine.</i>

00:08:21.467 --> 00:08:23.269 line:95%,end
(French)
<i>Chaine.</i>

00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:25.004 line:95%,end
(French)
Sit.

00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:27.573 line:95%,end
Boom.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.675 line:95%,end
Up. (indistinct)
Just here.

00:08:29.742 --> 00:08:30.977 line:95%,end
No body roll.
Just here.

00:08:31.043 --> 00:08:33.312 line:95%,end
But you're facing this way.
You need to face the corner.

00:08:33.379 --> 00:08:36.215 line:5%,start
It's a lot of pressure because
I'm at the top of the pyramid

00:08:36.649 --> 00:08:39.118 line:95%,end
and I have to remember it all.

00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:40.786 line:95%,end
(chuckles)

00:08:40.853 --> 00:08:41.988 line:95%,end
I'm leaving.

00:08:42.054 --> 00:08:42.922 line:95%,end
Where are you going?

00:08:42.989 --> 00:08:44.123 line:95%,end
I'm going to take my kids somewhere.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:45.992 line:95%,end
To do what?

00:08:46.058 --> 00:08:47.627 line:95%,end
Just leaving.
There's only 20 minutes left so...

00:08:47.693 --> 00:08:49.228 line:95%,end
-What have you got going on?
-I'm just going.

00:08:49.295 --> 00:08:50.129 line:95%,end
I'm leaving.

00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:52.198 line:95%,end
I'm going. There's no reason to be here.

00:08:52.265 --> 00:08:53.599 line:95%,end
My liar radar went up.

00:08:53.666 --> 00:08:55.067 line:95%,end
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

00:08:55.134 --> 00:08:58.971 line:95%,end
Because there is no way
Melissa was leaving dance early

00:08:59.038 --> 00:09:00.573 line:95%,end
because dance is her life.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.275 line:95%,end
I knew she was going somewhere.

00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:03.676 line:95%,end
It was somewhere important.

00:09:03.743 --> 00:09:04.877 line:95%,end
Please.

00:09:04.944 --> 00:09:06.512 line:95%,end
She probably has meeting, meeting,

00:09:06.579 --> 00:09:07.813 line:95%,end
meeting, meeting, meeting,
meeting, meeting,

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.815 line:95%,end
-commercial meeting set up.
-But why is it such a secret?

00:09:09.882 --> 00:09:13.819 line:95%,end
Like why does she just sneak out
and do it behind our backs?

00:09:13.886 --> 00:09:15.454 line:95%,end
That's how she operates.

00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:20.660 line:95%,end
Okay, come on, kids.

00:09:20.726 --> 00:09:22.094 line:95%,end
Right here in this cool door.

00:09:25.264 --> 00:09:26.866 line:95%,end
JEN: <i>Hi, gorgeous.</i>
<i>How are you?</i>

00:09:26.933 --> 00:09:29.802 line:5%,start
-Hello.
-Hi, Katie. How are you?

00:09:29.869 --> 00:09:33.239 line:95%,end
I have been in contact with an agency
since last summer,

00:09:33.306 --> 00:09:36.442 line:95%,end
so I thought I'd take my children
to a general meeting,

00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:37.476 line:95%,end
to MSA.

00:09:37.543 --> 00:09:39.078 line:95%,end
How long have you been dancing, honey?

00:09:39.145 --> 00:09:40.613 line:95%,end
For seven years.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.415 line:95%,end
For seven years.
Okay, great.

00:09:42.481 --> 00:09:44.417 line:95%,end
Well, I think you guys
would be really fantastic,

00:09:44.483 --> 00:09:45.585 line:95%,end
obviously, for commercials.

00:09:45.651 --> 00:09:47.320 line:95%,end
Commercials are great for kids.

00:09:47.386 --> 00:09:49.355 line:95%,end
What would the next step be
'cause we like--

00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:52.692 line:95%,end
to get Mackenzie into a commercial,
or you know.

00:09:52.758 --> 00:09:55.094 line:95%,end
As soon as something comes up
that they're right for, you know,

00:09:55.161 --> 00:09:56.295 line:95%,end
I'll let you guys know.

00:09:56.362 --> 00:09:57.496 line:95%,end
I'll submit them
and we'll go from there.

00:09:57.563 --> 00:09:58.564 line:95%,end
-Okay, great.
-JEN: Cool?

00:09:58.631 --> 00:09:59.832 line:95%,end
-Thank you so much...
-You're welcome.

00:09:59.899 --> 00:10:01.133 line:95%,end
...for meeting with us
on such short notice.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.501 line:95%,end
I understand.
It's no problem.

00:10:02.568 --> 00:10:05.104 line:95%,end
Maddie and Kenzie both shined
at the interview, I feel,

00:10:05.171 --> 00:10:07.974 line:95%,end
and Jen and the girls
really made a connection.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.208 line:95%,end
<i>So I'm hoping for the best.</i>

00:10:09.275 --> 00:10:10.343 line:95%,end
(chatter)

00:10:10.409 --> 00:10:13.946 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:18.551 line:5%,start
ABBY: So ready?
Let's take it from the top.

00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:20.252 line:5%,start
("City Of Angels" playing)

00:10:20.319 --> 00:10:23.856 line:5%,start
<i>âª See the yoga buddies</i>
<i>in their SUVs âª</i>

00:10:23.923 --> 00:10:28.027 line:95%,end
<i>âª They got their cups of coffee</i>
<i>and their inner peace âª</i>

00:10:28.094 --> 00:10:31.897 line:95%,end
<i>âª See the homeless dude</i>
<i>sleeping in a box âª</i>

00:10:31.964 --> 00:10:34.800 line:95%,end
<i>âª Just look the other way,</i>
<i>but it never stops âª</i>

00:10:34.867 --> 00:10:37.470 line:95%,end
PAIGE: <i>I'm running my dance,</i>
<i>"City of Angels."</i>

00:10:37.536 --> 00:10:39.105 line:5%,start
And I really like it,

00:10:39.171 --> 00:10:42.875 line:5%,start
but I know that Abby is watering it down
just because of my foot.

00:10:42.942 --> 00:10:44.310 line:95%,end
<i>And it's starting to hurt,</i>

00:10:44.377 --> 00:10:46.879 line:95%,end
so I don't know if I'll be able
to dance at competition.

00:10:46.946 --> 00:10:48.648 line:95%,end
ABBY: Let's go.
We got to move.

00:10:48.714 --> 00:10:50.282 line:95%,end
You're out of here.
Thank you, Kelly.

00:10:50.349 --> 00:10:53.019 line:95%,end
Paige's foot is not 100% healed yet,

00:10:53.085 --> 00:10:56.288 line:95%,end
so I can't make her run the routine
over and over and over.

00:10:56.355 --> 00:10:58.124 line:95%,end
It could cause more injury to the foot.

00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:59.592 line:95%,end
-How are you feeling?
-Do you like your number?

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:01.060 line:95%,end
-Are you on the couch most of the time?
-HOLLY: Don't cry.

00:11:01.127 --> 00:11:02.528 line:95%,end
-Oh, no, no, no.
-JILL: Don't cry, Paige.

00:11:04.997 --> 00:11:06.632 line:95%,end
KELLY:
Did Abby say something?

00:11:06.699 --> 00:11:08.801 line:95%,end
My foot hurts.

00:11:09.435 --> 00:11:11.237 line:95%,end
KELLY:
<i>Paige has had a broken foot.</i>

00:11:11.303 --> 00:11:12.772 line:95%,end
<i>And for her to go out there</i>

00:11:12.838 --> 00:11:15.474 line:95%,end
after having one hour
to learn a dance

00:11:15.541 --> 00:11:17.543 line:95%,end
and to practice on a prop is not fair.


00:11:21.147 --> 00:11:24.350 line:5%,start
(subtle music playing)

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:28.888 line:95%,end
Hi, ladies.

00:11:28.954 --> 00:11:30.222 line:95%,end
Hey.

00:11:30.289 --> 00:11:33.059 line:95%,end
ABBY:
<i>This is a busy day for me.</i>

00:11:33.125 --> 00:11:35.561 line:5%,start
We have two more days
until the competition,

00:11:35.628 --> 00:11:36.896 line:5%,start
48 hours.

00:11:36.962 --> 00:11:39.298 line:95%,end
<i>I have six solos to look at.</i>

00:11:39.365 --> 00:11:41.200 line:95%,end
So girls, we're going to work.

00:11:41.267 --> 00:11:44.270 line:5%,start
(soft dance music playing)

00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:51.077 line:95%,end
Chloe is doing a routine called "Ghost."

00:11:51.143 --> 00:11:52.545 line:95%,end
The music is pretty.

00:11:52.611 --> 00:11:54.146 line:95%,end
<i>It gets bigger and bigger.</i>

00:11:54.213 --> 00:11:56.115 line:95%,end
I think this is a good number for her.

00:11:56.182 --> 00:11:59.185 line:95%,end
(soft dance music continuing)

00:12:04.523 --> 00:12:07.059 line:95%,end
ABBY: Chloe, remember,
I am watching everybody.

00:12:07.126 --> 00:12:10.863 line:95%,end
This routine this week
is my decision for nationals.

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:13.265 line:95%,end
I've been very impressed with
Chloe for the last two weeks.

00:12:13.332 --> 00:12:14.333 line:95%,end
She's worked hard.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.701 line:95%,end
Keep working on it.

00:12:15.768 --> 00:12:16.669 line:95%,end
Tell me a story.

00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:18.971 line:95%,end
This kid has got it.

00:12:20.139 --> 00:12:21.774 line:95%,end
So guys, Brooke and I were talking,

00:12:21.841 --> 00:12:23.576 line:95%,end
and you know how she wrote a song?

00:12:23.642 --> 00:12:24.877 line:95%,end
While I'm out here in LA,

00:12:24.944 --> 00:12:27.947 line:95%,end
we want to record Brooke's
song professionally,

00:12:28.013 --> 00:12:28.848 line:95%,end
(gasps)

00:12:28.914 --> 00:12:30.116 line:95%,end
-That's awesome.
-...and we want you guys

00:12:30.182 --> 00:12:32.318 line:95%,end
to come with us
and be her backup singers.

00:12:32.384 --> 00:12:33.519 line:95%,end
(gasps)

00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:34.987 line:95%,end
(cheering)

00:12:37.223 --> 00:12:39.125 line:5%,start
Brooke wants to have a singing career.

00:12:39.191 --> 00:12:42.428 line:5%,start
Well, I've hired a music producer
to record her song.

00:12:42.495 --> 00:12:45.064 line:5%,start
SINGER:
<i>âª Woo, come on, girls âª</i>

00:12:45.131 --> 00:12:47.867 line:95%,end
<i>âª We got a bunch of kids,</i>
<i>the coolest ones around âª</i>

00:12:47.933 --> 00:12:50.603 line:95%,end
<i>âª Shake it, shake it, baby,</i>
<i>make the world go round âª</i>

00:12:50.669 --> 00:12:53.606 line:95%,end
Nia's routine is packed
full of entertainment value.

00:12:53.672 --> 00:12:54.974 line:95%,end
SINGER:
<i>âª We're going to get the party going âª</i>

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.208 line:95%,end
<i>âª Pump that crowd âª</i>

00:12:56.275 --> 00:12:57.843 line:95%,end
<i>âª Shake it âª</i>

00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:59.612 line:95%,end
And that's Nia does best.

00:12:59.678 --> 00:13:01.614 line:95%,end
Okay, this is a '60s number.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:02.681 line:95%,end
Some people may love it.

00:13:02.748 --> 00:13:04.250 line:95%,end
Some people may hate it.

00:13:04.316 --> 00:13:07.219 line:95%,end
You have to make them love you,

00:13:07.286 --> 00:13:09.021 line:95%,end
regardless of the choreography

00:13:09.088 --> 00:13:10.823 line:95%,end
or the costume
or the music.

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:12.091 line:95%,end
Get it?

00:13:12.158 --> 00:13:13.058 line:95%,end
All right.

00:13:15.294 --> 00:13:16.929 line:95%,end
So yesterday, I got a phone call.

We had a general meeting with MSA.

00:13:18.864 --> 00:13:20.065 line:95%,end
It was pretty cool.

00:13:22.067 --> 00:13:23.435 line:95%,end

CHRISTI:
<i>Melissa hates to be one upped.</i>

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:27.306 line:5%,start
As soon as Kelly said
she was doing anything for her kids,

00:13:27.373 --> 00:13:29.675 line:5%,start
Melissa's like, "Oh, I already
did something for mine."

00:13:29.742 --> 00:13:30.910 line:5%,start
I took them to an agent.

00:13:30.976 --> 00:13:32.511 line:95%,end
Why didn't you tell us
you were going somewhere?

00:13:32.578 --> 00:13:34.580 line:95%,end
Because I just wanted to go.

00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:36.782 line:95%,end
Because you like to do
stuff without telling us.

00:13:37.683 --> 00:13:39.318 line:95%,end
Yeah, why was it such a big secret?

00:13:39.385 --> 00:13:41.654 line:95%,end
They called me yesterday
and asked if they could see me.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.589 line:95%,end
But you still could have told us.

00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:45.090 line:95%,end
Like that's what we get
mad about, Melissa.

00:13:45.157 --> 00:13:47.593 line:95%,end
I just think that these kinds of things

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.528 line:95%,end
are the things that make Maddie feel bad.

00:13:51.263 --> 00:13:53.332 line:95%,end
Maddie wants to be part of our group.

00:13:53.399 --> 00:13:54.400 line:95%,end
MELISSA:
I know she does.

00:13:54.466 --> 00:13:56.135 line:95%,end
But you and Abby don't let her.

00:13:56.202 --> 00:13:57.303 line:95%,end
JILL:
Are you going to tell Abby?

00:13:57.369 --> 00:14:00.606 line:95%,end
Is this something that
is her business or--

00:14:00.673 --> 00:14:01.640 line:95%,end
I'm just curious.

00:14:01.707 --> 00:14:04.543 line:95%,end
Yesterday, Melissa left
the rehearsal early

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:05.778 line:95%,end
with both of her kids.

00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:06.879 line:95%,end
I don't know where she went,

00:14:06.946 --> 00:14:08.547 line:95%,end
but I'm gonna get to the bottom of it.

00:14:08.614 --> 00:14:10.916 line:95%,end
So tell me where you went.

00:14:10.983 --> 00:14:13.118 line:95%,end
We went to MSA.

00:14:13.185 --> 00:14:14.320 line:95%,end
-ABBY: To a guy?
-A girl.

00:14:14.386 --> 00:14:16.222 line:95%,end
MACKENZIE:
We went to a girl named Jen.

00:14:16.288 --> 00:14:17.256 line:95%,end
Okay, I know Jen.

00:14:17.323 --> 00:14:18.390 line:95%,end
I know who Jen is.

00:14:18.457 --> 00:14:19.925 line:95%,end
Does anybody know?

00:14:19.992 --> 00:14:22.194 line:95%,end
I think my mom told everyone
you were fine with it.

00:14:23.128 --> 00:14:25.698 line:95%,end
(dramatic music playing)

00:14:25.764 --> 00:14:28.367 line:95%,end
Maddie, you can't worry
if they're not fine with it.

00:14:28.434 --> 00:14:31.403 line:95%,end
I've been trying to tell
your mother, who cares?

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:34.340 line:95%,end
You're gonna graduate from high school
and never see these people again.

00:14:34.406 --> 00:14:36.275 line:95%,end
Do you get it? These vultures?

00:14:36.342 --> 00:14:38.611 line:95%,end
That's not the way they run,
they don't really care.

00:14:39.645 --> 00:14:41.046 line:95%,end
They don't care. I care.

00:14:42.314 --> 00:14:43.148 line:95%,end
All right?

00:14:43.215 --> 00:14:44.617 line:95%,end
Okay? So, get back in line,

00:14:44.683 --> 00:14:47.119 line:95%,end
and do not discuss MSA.
Do you understand?

00:14:47.186 --> 00:14:48.988 line:95%,end
Yes? All right, go ahead,
get back in there.

00:14:49.054 --> 00:14:49.889 line:95%,end
MACKENZIE:
Thank you.

00:14:49.955 --> 00:14:53.559 line:95%,end
I know Melissa wants what's best
for Maddie and Mackenzie,

00:14:53.626 --> 00:14:55.461 line:95%,end
but it's not about signing
them with an agent.

00:14:55.527 --> 00:14:57.696 line:95%,end
It's about concentrating
on their dancing,

00:14:57.763 --> 00:14:58.831 line:95%,end
their education,

00:14:58.898 --> 00:14:59.965 line:5%,start

you have two more days

00:15:03.402 --> 00:15:05.738 line:95%,end
Your jumps need to be higher

Your tumbling skills...

00:15:07.773 --> 00:15:09.008 line:95%,end

Let's do it.

00:15:10.175 --> 00:15:12.278 line:5%,start
My solo this week is called "Fly,"

00:15:12.344 --> 00:15:13.846 line:5%,start
and it's an acrobatic routine.

00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:16.115 line:5%,start

00:19:44.917 --> 00:19:47.519 line:5%,start

00:19:47.586 --> 00:19:49.054 line:95%,end
Run up.
Run down.

00:19:49.121 --> 00:19:50.422 line:95%,end
You're just having fun.
Like da, da, da.

00:19:50.489 --> 00:19:52.157 line:95%,end
You don't even know
there's a camera on you.

00:19:52.224 --> 00:19:53.625 line:95%,end
Up, up, up,

00:19:53.692 --> 00:19:54.893 line:95%,end
And back up in the middle.

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.528 line:95%,end
Oh, there's some guy
taking my picture.

00:19:56.595 --> 00:19:58.564 line:95%,end
Yes? And then turn up.

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:00.065 line:95%,end
High arms, big butt.

00:20:00.132 --> 00:20:01.934 line:95%,end
Look, and then take
that camera with you.

00:20:03.035 --> 00:20:04.436 line:95%,end
Got it? All right, ready?

00:20:04.503 --> 00:20:07.372 line:95%,end
A lot of the ideas that Abby
has for the video

00:20:07.439 --> 00:20:08.340 line:95%,end

-Yes.

-ABBY: Okay.

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:21.420 line:95%,end
Shooting a music video in LA?
I mean, come on.

00:20:21.486 --> 00:20:22.955 line:95%,end
That's a dream job.

00:20:23.922 --> 00:20:24.890 line:95%,end
Run, Maddie, run.

00:20:24.957 --> 00:20:28.093 line:5%,start

Yeah. We're done.

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:45.944 line:95%,end
<i>All right, ladies.</i>

00:20:46.011 --> 00:20:48.747 line:5%,start
I only have the studio
for 45 more minutes,

00:20:49.248 --> 00:20:51.283 line:95%,end
because we did a video today.

00:20:51.783 --> 00:20:53.285 line:95%,end
This week is very important.

00:20:53.352 --> 00:20:54.853 line:95%,end
I'm making my decision

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.321 line:95%,end
<i>on who gets to dance at nationals.</i>

00:20:56.922 --> 00:20:59.524 line:95%,end
So these girls need to bring
everything they have

00:20:59.591 --> 00:21:01.660 line:95%,end
and impress me with their solos.

00:21:03.562 --> 00:21:05.597 line:95%,end
I really wanted to do a solo this week

00:21:05.664 --> 00:21:09.601 line:95%,end
because of the competition
and because we're in LA,

00:21:09.668 --> 00:21:12.371 line:95%,end
and I just love doing solos.

00:21:12.437 --> 00:21:14.706 line:95%,end
All right. Well, if you love doing solos,

00:21:14.773 --> 00:21:17.409 line:95%,end
then whenever you're offered one,
you should jump at the opportunity,

00:21:17.476 --> 00:21:19.244 line:95%,end
because it's not going to always come by.

00:21:19.311 --> 00:21:21.713 line:95%,end
I can tell Maddie really wants a solo,

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:23.682 line:95%,end
and I think she's learned her lesson,

00:21:23.749 --> 00:21:26.318 line:95%,end
<i>so it's time to put this kid</i>
<i>back in the game.</i>

00:21:26.385 --> 00:21:29.154 line:95%,end
Maddie, you haven't had a solo in weeks,

00:21:29.221 --> 00:21:31.290 line:95%,end
so this is your big chance to show me

00:21:31.356 --> 00:21:32.924 line:95%,end
that you still have the ambition.

00:21:32.991 --> 00:21:35.527 line:95%,end
I'm so glad Miss Abby
gave me a solo,

00:21:35.594 --> 00:21:38.730 line:95%,end
because I think that
I really deserved it,

00:21:38.797 --> 00:21:40.832 line:95%,end
and I don't want to let her down.

00:21:42.701 --> 00:21:45.704 line:5%,start
ABBY: Turn your knees out
when you land that <i>chaine.</i>

00:21:45.771 --> 00:21:47.839 line:5%,start
You're not stepping on
a turned out foot.

00:21:48.874 --> 00:21:50.776 line:95%,end
Lean your back foot in the attitude.

00:21:50.842 --> 00:21:52.678 line:95%,end
You are rusty, kid.

00:21:56.048 --> 00:21:58.984 line:95%,end
I always expected that Maddie
would have a solo going into nationals.

00:21:59.051 --> 00:22:00.686 line:95%,end
I knew she was going to have a solo,

00:22:00.752 --> 00:22:03.021 line:95%,end
whether she took off
two weeks, five weeks.

00:22:03.088 --> 00:22:04.489 line:95%,end
I don't want that kid
to go to nationals.

00:22:04.556 --> 00:22:07.526 line:95%,end
I think the most telling thing in there,
when she was yelling at Maddie

00:22:07.592 --> 00:22:08.994 line:95%,end
that she was rusty after three weeks.

00:22:09.061 --> 00:22:11.563 line:95%,end
Hello? None of the other kids ever dance.

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:12.898 line:95%,end
It proved our point.

00:22:12.964 --> 00:22:16.234 line:95%,end
You only get better
by having more practice on stage.

00:22:16.301 --> 00:22:17.703 line:95%,end

I think I'm ready to pull off a solo,

00:22:24.776 --> 00:22:27.979 line:95%,end
but I need to show Miss Abby
that I did deserve it.

00:22:31.316 --> 00:22:32.818 line:95%,end
ABBY:
Okay, stand up.

00:22:32.884 --> 00:22:34.920 line:95%,end
You wanted this solo,
you got it.

00:22:36.455 --> 00:22:39.624 line:95%,end
The kids are working their
butts off to impress me.

This competition is very important

Not only do they have to win,
but they have to impress me.

I'm making my decision for nationals.

00:23:24.669 --> 00:23:27.172 line:95%,end
These solos today need to be top notch.

00:23:27.239 --> 00:23:28.874 line:95%,end
Today is not the day for mistakes.

00:23:30.008 --> 00:23:31.109 line:95%,end
Girls, you have to understand.

00:23:31.176 --> 00:23:33.145 line:95%,end
Not only is just today a big day

00:23:33.211 --> 00:23:36.047 line:95%,end
because of the other dance studios
that are here,


00:23:36.114 --> 00:23:38.216 line:95%,end
but this is the end of the road.

00:23:38.784 --> 00:23:40.585 line:95%,end
Maybe the end of the line for some of you.

You ready?

You need to run it over again?

00:36:08.199 --> 00:36:12.403 line:95%,end
Brooke, you can get out there
and you can be gorgeous

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:15.439 line:95%,end
and everybody's going to leave here
talking about the acrobat

00:36:15.506 --> 00:36:17.074 line:95%,end
and how great she was.

00:36:17.141 --> 00:36:20.545 line:95%,end

and crash and burn.

It's up to you, kid.

00:36:24.315 --> 00:36:28.019 line:5%,start
I'm about to go onstage for <i>Fly,</i>
and I'm pretty confident,

00:36:28.085 --> 00:36:30.922 line:95%,end

I'm going to forget it,

with our divisional overall.

00:38:05.082 --> 00:38:06.550 line:95%,end
Well, we are going to start off

00:38:08.386 --> 00:38:12.189 line:95%,end

00:38:18.329 --> 00:38:22.166 line:5%,start
Congratulations to all
of our elite mini soloists.

00:38:22.233 --> 00:38:25.102 line:5%,start
I got first place, and I'm really excited.

00:38:25.169 --> 00:38:27.438 line:95%,end
We are now going to be acknowledging
our top 10


00:38:27.505 --> 00:38:30.074 line:95%,end
highest scoring elite junior soloists.

CHLOE: <i>My solo "Ghost" placed sixth.</i>

00:38:38.883 --> 00:38:40.084 line:5%,start
And there were a lot of good girls here,

00:38:40.151 --> 00:38:42.253 line:5%,start
but I could have done better,

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:44.055 line:95%,end
<i>so I'm just going to try harder next time.</i>

00:38:44.522 --> 00:38:47.558 line:95%,end
Fifth place, with a score of 270.5 points,

00:38:47.625 --> 00:38:51.195 line:5%,start

JILL: <i>Kendall has just beat Chloe.</i>

My little girl just beat
one of Abby's "bit time" students.

00:39:00.671 --> 00:39:01.806 line:95%,end
This is good.

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:06.844 line:95%,end
Finally, ladies and gentlemen,
your highest scoring elite junior soloist

MELISSA: <i>So Maddie placed first.</i>

00:39:19.824 --> 00:39:21.292 line:5%,start
I was so proud of her.

00:39:21.359 --> 00:39:24.362 line:5%,start
And, you know,
she learned her dance in one day,

00:39:24.428 --> 00:39:27.164 line:95%,end
and she worked her butt off
so she can win.

00:39:27.231 --> 00:39:30.201 line:95%,end
Congratulations to our elite
junior soloists.

00:39:30.267 --> 00:39:31.702 line:95%,end
NIA: <i>I'm very disappointed</i>

00:39:31.769 --> 00:39:34.004 line:5%,start
because I knew I could always do better,

00:39:34.071 --> 00:39:37.007 line:5%,start
and next time
I'll make sure that I do better.

00:39:37.074 --> 00:39:38.242 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: <i>Maddie beat Chloe.</i>

00:39:38.309 --> 00:39:39.343 line:5%,start
So did Kendall.

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:41.712 line:5%,start
And I have known Abby long enough to know

00:39:41.779 --> 00:39:43.848 line:95%,end
<i>that she may hold sixth place</i>
<i>against Chloe</i>

00:39:43.914 --> 00:39:46.317 line:95%,end
and not give her a solo for nationals.

00:39:47.151 --> 00:39:48.452 line:95%,end
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are going to start

00:39:48.519 --> 00:39:51.122 line:95%,end
with our elite team of the solo division
of the competition.

00:39:51.188 --> 00:39:55.860 line:95%,end
Fourth place with a score of 271.2 points,

00:39:55.926 --> 00:39:58.729 line:95%,end
Miss Brooke with act number 301.

00:40:00.965 --> 00:40:03.000 line:5%,start
BROOKE: <i>I placed fourth for </i>Fly,

00:40:03.067 --> 00:40:05.269 line:95%,end
but I think Abby will still be proud of me

00:40:05.336 --> 00:40:09.206 line:95%,end
because she saw how amazing
the dancers were.

00:40:09.273 --> 00:40:11.509 line:95%,end
<i>So I think she'll be happy with fourth.</i>

00:40:11.575 --> 00:40:13.277 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>I'm really concerned</i>
<i>about nationals</i>

00:40:13.344 --> 00:40:15.379 line:95%,end
<i>because, you know, Paige went on stage</i>

00:40:15.446 --> 00:40:19.517 line:5%,start
and she didn't place
and Brooke got fourth.

00:40:19.583 --> 00:40:22.820 line:5%,start
So my kids really don't have a good chance

00:40:22.887 --> 00:40:24.355 line:95%,end
<i>of performing at nationals.</i>

00:40:24.422 --> 00:40:26.724 line:95%,end
ABBY: I think, all things considered,

00:40:26.791 --> 00:40:28.993 line:95%,end
I'm glad that we were in the top five,
and I always am.

00:40:29.059 --> 00:40:30.161 line:95%,end
I just want that clean sweep.

00:40:30.227 --> 00:40:31.595 line:95%,end
I want to walk into a competition

00:40:31.662 --> 00:40:33.998 line:95%,end
and walk out winning everything.

00:40:34.064 --> 00:40:35.433 line:95%,end
Melissa, I guess it was your lucky day.

00:40:35.499 --> 00:40:37.468 line:95%,end
Both of your kids
were the overall highest winners.

00:40:37.535 --> 00:40:38.402 line:95%,end
You're doing something right.

00:40:39.637 --> 00:40:42.339 line:5%,start
Girls, this was a test for nationals.

00:40:42.406 --> 00:40:46.343 line:5%,start
And I said, it doesn't matter really
what the judges think.

00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:47.478 line:5%,start
It's what I think.

00:40:47.545 --> 00:40:49.280 line:5%,start
Who grew? Who learned?

00:40:49.346 --> 00:40:51.015 line:5%,start
This competition, ladies,

00:40:51.081 --> 00:40:52.850 line:5%,start
was to see what we're going to do
at nationals.

00:40:52.917 --> 00:40:54.952 line:5%,start
I don't know what's going to happen
next week for nationals.

00:40:55.019 --> 00:40:56.454 line:5%,start
<i>I might use the whole group.</i>

00:40:56.854 --> 00:40:58.122 line:5%,start
I might not.

00:40:58.189 --> 00:41:01.258 line:5%,start
I have to worry about what's best
for the Abby Lee Dance Company,

00:41:01.325 --> 00:41:02.693 line:5%,start
and if that means some people not dancing,

00:41:03.093 --> 00:41:04.261 line:5%,start
that's what it means.
