CHRISTI: That's a $68,000 floor,
and you're going to throw a chair on it?

00:00:04.704 --> 00:00:05.538 line:95%,end
Tonight...

00:00:05.605 --> 00:00:06.740 line:95%,end
Kelly has never lied to me.

00:00:06.806 --> 00:00:08.842 line:95%,end
I can't say the same for Melissa.

00:00:08.908 --> 00:00:09.976 line:95%,end
JEFF: <i>...for the very first time...</i>

00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:11.544 line:95%,end
HOLLY: I think Kelly speaks her mind.

00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:13.446 line:95%,end
And when she does, watch out.

00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:15.749 line:95%,end
JEFF: ...the women of <i>Dance Moms</i> reunite.

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:18.018 line:95%,end
KELLY: I don't need her
to tell me I'm a bitch.

00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:19.352 line:95%,end
-I already know I am.
-Right.

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:21.788 line:95%,end
JEFF: <i>It's a two-part </i>Dance Moms<i> reunion.</i>

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:24.224 line:95%,end
-Hold on, hold on, hold on.
-KELLY: I swear on my children's life.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.159 line:95%,end
-I swear on my mother's grave.
-Knock it off.

00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:27.894 line:95%,end
CATHY: I'm not done, so close your mouth.

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:29.996 line:95%,end
-I did not say that.
-KELLY: Go back and watch that clip.

00:00:30.063 --> 00:00:30.930 line:95%,end
Cuckoo.

00:00:30.997 --> 00:00:32.232 line:95%,end
JEFF: I just hope I can survive.

SINGER: <i>âª Living on the dance floor âª</i>

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:39.139 line:5%,start
Hi, everybody, and welcome
to <i>Dance Moms,</i> the Reunion.

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:42.075 line:5%,start
I'm Jeff Collins,
the executive producer of the show.

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:45.011 line:95%,end
Joining me is the woman
at the center of it all,

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:48.448 line:95%,end
the owner of the renowned
Abby Lee Dance Company,

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:49.582 line:95%,end
Abby Lee Miller.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.618 line:95%,end
-How are you?
-Good.

00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:53.053 line:95%,end
-It's great to see you.
-I'm so nervous.

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:55.221 line:95%,end
I feel like I should call you Miss Abby,
like the kids.

00:00:55.288 --> 00:00:57.257 line:95%,end
-Well, you can.
-(Jeff laughs)

00:00:57.323 --> 00:01:01.728 line:95%,end
Also joining us, the always opinionated,
always fabulous Dance Moms.

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:06.066 line:95%,end
Welcome, Melissa Gisoni,
Dr. Holly Frazier,

00:01:06.132 --> 00:01:09.369 line:95%,end
Christi Lukasiak, and Kelly Hyland.

00:01:09.436 --> 00:01:10.470 line:95%,end
How are you ladies?

00:01:10.537 --> 00:01:12.038 line:95%,end
-ALL: Great.
-It's good to have you here.

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:13.306 line:95%,end
-WOMAN: Thanks, Jeff.
-Thanks for having us.

00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:17.210 line:95%,end
JEFF: One of the things that you say a lot
is that everybody's replaceable.

00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:22.348 line:95%,end
But one thing that we know
is that there's only one Abby Lee Miller.

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:23.316 line:95%,end
Take a look at this.

00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:25.385 line:95%,end
WOMAN: <i>Everybody is replaceable.</i>

00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:27.153 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>We all know everyone is replaceable.</i>

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.621 line:95%,end
Everyone's replaceable.

00:01:28.688 --> 00:01:31.124 line:95%,end
I have the success rate

00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:35.295 line:95%,end
I have with producing professional dancers
because of the delivery.

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:37.864 line:95%,end
This is my domain. I'm the principal here.

00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:39.365 line:95%,end
It's my (indistinct)

00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:40.900 line:95%,end
-What you fail to realize, Abby...
-ABBY: I don't fail to realize anything.

00:01:40.967 --> 00:01:42.635 line:95%,end
...is that you don't control me.

00:01:42.702 --> 00:01:45.038 line:95%,end
ABBY: I will not be bossed around
in my own studio.

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:48.641 line:95%,end
She has a deep voice
that you will be very afraid of.

00:01:48.708 --> 00:01:50.543 line:95%,end
Who's afraid of it, you?

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.112 line:95%,end
-Well, no.
-I'm a little afraid of it.

00:01:52.612 --> 00:01:53.446 line:95%,end
ABBY: Listen to me.

00:01:53.513 --> 00:01:56.649 line:95%,end
I don't want to look at the sad,
horrible kid all day, yes?

00:01:56.716 --> 00:01:58.151 line:95%,end
So put a smile on your face.

00:01:58.218 --> 00:01:59.385 line:95%,end
Walk, walk, walk.

00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:01.354 line:95%,end
Woo-hoo! Smaller steps.

00:02:01.421 --> 00:02:03.756 line:95%,end
Wow! One, two, three. Woo-hoo.

00:02:03.823 --> 00:02:05.091 line:95%,end
WOMAN: You're not throwing her out.

00:02:05.158 --> 00:02:06.826 line:95%,end
ABBY: Oh, yes, I am. And you with her.

00:02:06.893 --> 00:02:08.428 line:95%,end
Every week we put the trash out.

00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:09.329 line:95%,end
Go.

00:02:10.063 --> 00:02:11.698 line:95%,end
Then take yourself out,

00:02:11.764 --> 00:02:14.501 line:95%,end
because you're the biggest
piece of trash there is.

00:02:14.567 --> 00:02:15.768 line:95%,end
What do you think the spoon is for?

00:02:15.835 --> 00:02:17.871 line:95%,end
ALL: Ice cream.

00:02:17.937 --> 00:02:20.073 line:95%,end
-Are we right?
-Yes, we're right.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.407 line:95%,end
-We're having a treat.
-BOTH: Yes!

00:02:21.474 --> 00:02:23.143 line:95%,end
ABBY: A treat. Cheers.

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.146 line:95%,end
HOLLY: I stand on my credentials
and my knowledge.

00:02:26.212 --> 00:02:28.248 line:95%,end
-ABBY: That's fine.
-That's something you can never take away.

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:31.885 line:95%,end
Then fix this hair, because it's horrible.

00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:35.054 line:95%,end
(cheering)

00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:37.257 line:95%,end
No one's gonna hug me? Yay!

00:02:37.323 --> 00:02:39.759 line:95%,end
Woo!
We won first place with our group number.

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:41.494 line:95%,end
Yeah! Oh, yeah!

00:02:42.128 --> 00:02:43.129 line:95%,end
I'm proud of the kids.

00:02:43.196 --> 00:02:44.497 line:95%,end
They did what they needed to do.

00:02:44.564 --> 00:02:47.233 line:95%,end
And moms, you chased away Cathy.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.668 line:95%,end
You chased away Jill.

00:02:48.735 --> 00:02:50.270 line:95%,end
And now you're after Leslie.

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:52.739 line:95%,end
When you start messing with my livelihood,

00:02:52.805 --> 00:02:54.541 line:95%,end
that's when the curtain closes.

00:02:54.607 --> 00:02:56.309 line:95%,end
And I'll start messing with your kid.

00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:57.243 line:95%,end
Learn that.

00:03:00.313 --> 00:03:02.048 line:95%,end
So listen, let's get right to it.

00:03:02.115 --> 00:03:05.552 line:95%,end
Abby's way of talking to students,
some people say,

00:03:05.618 --> 00:03:07.353 line:95%,end
is a little harsh.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.588 line:95%,end
Christi, what do you think?

00:03:08.655 --> 00:03:10.390 line:95%,end
Oh, God. Yes, absolutely.

00:03:10.456 --> 00:03:12.625 line:95%,end
I worked with children for eight years

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:15.862 line:95%,end
before I became a full-time dance mom.

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:18.898 line:95%,end
And if I had talked to students that way,
I would have never had a business.

00:03:18.965 --> 00:03:20.967 line:95%,end
But it's not always with everyone.

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:22.802 line:95%,end
You know, she talks to certain kids
a certain way,

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:24.003 line:95%,end
and she talks to others another way.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.638 line:95%,end
-So--
-Well, what do you say about that, Holly?

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:27.307 line:95%,end
As an educator for 20 years,

00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:29.475 line:95%,end
we see a variety of teaching styles
and methods.

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:31.411 line:95%,end
And what I like about Abby is

00:03:31.477 --> 00:03:35.248 line:95%,end
she's very direct about
certain aspects of students' dancing

00:03:35.315 --> 00:03:36.916 line:95%,end
that she finds difficult.

00:03:36.983 --> 00:03:39.752 line:95%,end
So I think the message is often on target.

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.088 line:95%,end
I think her delivery
is sometimes off base.

00:03:42.155 --> 00:03:44.524 line:95%,end
JEFF: So Melissa,
Abby a good teacher or not?

00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:46.426 line:95%,end
I think Abby is a fabulous teacher.

00:03:46.492 --> 00:03:49.095 line:95%,end
She's been teaching my little Mackenzie
since she's three years old,

00:03:49.162 --> 00:03:52.632 line:95%,end
and Mackenzie has really blossomed
over the last year.

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:54.133 line:95%,end
And it's all because of Abby.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.070 line:95%,end
JEFF: So you say that dance moms
over the years have changed.

00:03:57.136 --> 00:03:59.672 line:95%,end
What's the difference between
what dance moms used to be like

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:00.740 line:95%,end
compared to these ladies?

00:04:00.807 --> 00:04:03.977 line:95%,end
ABBY: Many years ago, you had people
that couldn't leave their jobs.

00:04:04.043 --> 00:04:06.045 line:95%,end
They weren't stay-at-home moms.

00:04:06.112 --> 00:04:09.115 line:95%,end
Most of my clientele now
live a more privileged lifestyle.

00:04:09.182 --> 00:04:13.019 line:95%,end
And, you know, today,
kids get a trophy for being born.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.389 line:95%,end
So Melissa, you've been around
the dance world a long time.

00:04:16.456 --> 00:04:19.559 line:95%,end
How do you think other moms
would characterize you as a dance mom?

00:04:19.626 --> 00:04:22.262 line:95%,end
I think that they would say
that I'm an involved dance mom,

00:04:22.328 --> 00:04:24.998 line:95%,end
because I'm very involved in my kids,
just like all of us.

00:04:25.064 --> 00:04:26.866 line:95%,end
Christi, what do you think
other dance moms would say

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:28.268 line:95%,end
about what kind of dance mom she is?

00:04:28.334 --> 00:04:31.337 line:95%,end
Melissa spent a lot of time in the studio
in years past.

00:04:31.404 --> 00:04:34.073 line:95%,end
No one is going to disagree that

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.242 line:95%,end
we all want to be involved in
our children's lives.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.579 line:95%,end
And our kids go to school all day,

00:04:39.646 --> 00:04:41.614 line:95%,end
and they spend a lot of time
in the dance studio.

00:04:41.681 --> 00:04:44.450 line:95%,end
And so oftentimes, that's the only time
we get to spend with them.

00:04:44.517 --> 00:04:48.087 line:95%,end
So I think that that's what people say,
like, you're always at the dance studio.

00:04:48.154 --> 00:04:50.490 line:95%,end
Well, I don't look at it
that we're always at the dance studio.

00:04:50.556 --> 00:04:52.492 line:95%,end
I look at it as we're spending time
with our kids,

00:04:52.558 --> 00:04:54.861 line:95%,end
because if we weren't there,
I would never see them,

00:04:54.927 --> 00:04:57.330 line:95%,end
and we would turn around one day
and they'd be 18, moving out.

00:04:57.397 --> 00:05:00.333 line:95%,end
We're just willing to put the time in
to be with our children,


00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.601 line:95%,end
because I don't want to
turn around someday

00:05:01.668 --> 00:05:03.503 line:95%,end
and go, I missed their childhood.

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:06.272 line:95%,end
ABBY: Jeff, if I may,
Melissa's the kind of person that

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:07.840 line:95%,end
if a piece of paper
is laying on the floor,

00:05:07.907 --> 00:05:09.042 line:95%,end
she doesn't step over it.

00:05:09.108 --> 00:05:10.510 line:95%,end
She picks it up and throws it away.

00:05:10.576 --> 00:05:13.513 line:95%,end
And I think that
rubbed people the wrong way.

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:16.082 line:95%,end
People that had been there
for years and years and years,

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:19.419 line:95%,end
but they expected me to go
and ask them for help.

00:05:19.485 --> 00:05:20.987 line:95%,end
And I'm sure they would have helped me.

00:05:21.054 --> 00:05:23.089 line:95%,end
Melissa just started doing it.

00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:26.092 line:95%,end
We've had a couple of very
hectic seasons of rehearsals, road trips,

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:27.493 line:95%,end
and grueling competitions.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.363 line:95%,end
Thanks to these women right here,
the world has learned

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.333 line:95%,end
that it's definitely not easy
to be a dance mom.

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:36.135 line:95%,end
I want to know from each of you,
and you have to be absolutely honest,

00:05:36.202 --> 00:05:39.038 line:95%,end
who do you think, Holly,
is the most outrageous dance mom?

00:05:40.106 --> 00:05:40.940 line:95%,end
I don't know.

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:43.609 line:95%,end
I think we all equally share
that title at the moment.

00:05:43.676 --> 00:05:46.379 line:95%,end
You need to run for politics.
I keep telling you that.

00:05:46.446 --> 00:05:48.681 line:95%,end
Throw somebody under that bus!

00:05:48.748 --> 00:05:50.416 line:95%,end
HOLLY: I would say it's a tie
between Christi and Kelly.

00:05:50.483 --> 00:05:52.785 line:95%,end
I think Kelly definitely speaks her mind.

00:05:52.852 --> 00:05:54.821 line:95%,end
And when she does, watch out.

00:05:54.887 --> 00:05:57.290 line:95%,end
Let's go, Paige.
Brooke, you can leave class, too.

00:05:58.324 --> 00:06:01.160 line:95%,end
I do not want to support Abby
as a dance teacher.

00:06:01.227 --> 00:06:03.429 line:95%,end
I'm not doing it to my kids. I'm not.

00:06:03.496 --> 00:06:04.364 line:95%,end
Don't cry.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.632 line:95%,end
It's all your fault to begin with.
You can't just be smart.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.302 line:5%,start
-MELISSA: She just lets it fly.
-JEFF: All right.

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:10.603 line:95%,end
So since we've nailed Kelly,

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:14.207 line:95%,end
Kelly, who do you think is
the most outrageous, outspoken

00:06:14.273 --> 00:06:15.475 line:95%,end
craziest dance mom?

00:06:15.541 --> 00:06:16.376 line:95%,end
I think Christi.

00:06:16.442 --> 00:06:18.978 line:95%,end
You're not pecking at something,
and you're not pooping.

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:20.813 line:95%,end
Like, you just straighten your knees.

00:06:22.115 --> 00:06:23.049 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: Chloe!

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.285 line:95%,end
I think she pushes her kids more.

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:29.589 line:95%,end
-Like, when we're behind--
-You pushed Brooke when she was young.

00:06:29.655 --> 00:06:31.057 line:95%,end
-When she was young I did.
-You still push Paige.

00:06:31.124 --> 00:06:32.892 line:95%,end
Yeah, but Chloe's still young.

00:06:33.326 --> 00:06:34.327 line:95%,end
KELLY: No, she's 11.

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:35.928 line:95%,end
Yeah, but you were pushing Brooke
when she was 11.

00:06:35.995 --> 00:06:40.199 line:95%,end
Brooke, from, like, six to nine,
I really worked with Brooke.

00:06:40.266 --> 00:06:41.134 line:95%,end
Except I was friends with you,

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.836 line:95%,end
when you were still pushing her
when she was 10 and 11.

00:06:43.903 --> 00:06:46.672 line:95%,end
I don't--I disagree.
I don't think she pushed her at all.

00:06:46.739 --> 00:06:48.541 line:95%,end
I think she'd already live here,
and Brooke would have already been a star.

00:06:48.608 --> 00:06:52.145 line:95%,end
I think I fight with Abby a lot
and I speak my mind

00:06:52.211 --> 00:06:55.047 line:95%,end
because I'm standing up
for what I believe is right.

00:06:55.114 --> 00:06:57.116 line:95%,end
But I don't think I push my kids.

00:06:57.183 --> 00:06:58.851 line:95%,end
I don't think you do. I don't think so.

00:06:58.918 --> 00:07:00.653 line:95%,end
You know what's amazing
about the two of you,

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.422 line:95%,end
you guys are actually besties,

00:07:02.488 --> 00:07:04.357 line:95%,end
but yet you tell each other the truth.

00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:05.358 line:95%,end
-Yes.
-JEFF: You tell it like it is.

00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:07.794 line:95%,end
Well, everyone always thinks
that we don't argue.

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.061 line:95%,end
-That is not true.
-JEFF: Oh, I've seen you.

00:07:09.128 --> 00:07:10.630 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Kelly and I argue often.

00:07:10.696 --> 00:07:13.232 line:95%,end
I don't need her to tell me I'm a bitch.
I already know I am.

00:07:13.299 --> 00:07:15.067 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: But we're good enough friends

00:07:15.134 --> 00:07:19.372 line:95%,end
to know that if I tell her how I'm feeling
and I'm having a bad day,

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:21.808 line:95%,end
it's going to be fine tomorrow
because we get it.

00:07:21.874 --> 00:07:23.376 line:95%,end
People will come up to me and say,

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:25.745 line:95%,end
"How can you guys look at each other
after you sit and say something?"

00:07:25.812 --> 00:07:28.080 line:95%,end
But there's nothing that I say on the show
about any of these women--

00:07:28.147 --> 00:07:30.550 line:95%,end
-CHRISTI: That we haven't said.
-...that I wouldn't say to their face.

00:07:30.616 --> 00:07:32.985 line:95%,end
Kelly lives real close to me,
and I go to her house

00:07:33.052 --> 00:07:35.621 line:95%,end
after I take the kids to school sometimes
in my pajamas,

00:07:35.688 --> 00:07:36.889 line:95%,end
and we just sit and chat, have coffee.

00:07:36.956 --> 00:07:38.624 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I think that
that's what people don't understand.

00:07:38.691 --> 00:07:40.693 line:95%,end
We are ugly and nasty with each other.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.296 line:95%,end
But when the chips are down,
everyone has each other's back.

00:07:43.362 --> 00:07:45.531 line:95%,end
Everyone thinks Melissa and I
have this tension between us,

00:07:45.598 --> 00:07:47.600 line:95%,end
and we do to a certain degree.

00:07:47.667 --> 00:07:49.635 line:95%,end
But when I need something, I call Melissa.

00:07:49.702 --> 00:07:51.337 line:95%,end
And she's the first one to help me.

00:07:51.404 --> 00:07:53.005 line:95%,end
HOLLY: And that's the thing
about our relationship.

00:07:53.072 --> 00:07:54.874 line:95%,end
I think in many ways it's like a family

00:07:54.941 --> 00:07:58.244 line:95%,end
and we're dysfunctional
in our relationships in some respects.

00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:01.013 line:95%,end
But you don't get to pick
and choose members of your family.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.749 line:95%,end
We're all thrown into this
because we have a common bond.

00:08:03.816 --> 00:08:05.785 line:95%,end
Our daughters dance.

00:08:05.852 --> 00:08:08.855 line:95%,end
We're here,
and we learned how to navigate that.

00:08:08.921 --> 00:08:10.156 line:95%,end
I get to choose that.

00:08:10.223 --> 00:08:11.591 line:95%,end
-And I'm an only child.
-You don't get to choose that.

00:08:11.657 --> 00:08:14.193 line:95%,end
I'm an only child, so the whole family
thing is just like, whatever.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.329 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Yes,
but you created this family, Abby.

00:08:16.395 --> 00:08:18.130 line:95%,end
So the dysfunctionality
of our relationship--

00:08:18.197 --> 00:08:22.301 line:95%,end
I'm so glad to hear you say that,
because I can create another one.

00:08:22.368 --> 00:08:24.237 line:95%,end
Well, you could,
but that would be your loss.

00:08:24.303 --> 00:08:26.539 line:95%,end
JEFF: So listen, let's talk about
one of the things in the show

00:08:26.606 --> 00:08:28.808 line:95%,end
that is a very controversial
element of the show,

00:08:28.875 --> 00:08:31.043 line:95%,end
which is Abby's famous pyramid.

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:33.479 line:95%,end
Girls, let's go. Come on, girls.

00:08:33.546 --> 00:08:36.616 line:95%,end
(tense music playing)

00:08:36.682 --> 00:08:38.551 line:95%,end
JEFF: Why do you do the pyramid?

00:08:38.618 --> 00:08:40.353 line:95%,end
Every dance teacher in the country--

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:43.689 line:95%,end
I mean, choreographers that I deal with
and my colleagues,

00:08:43.756 --> 00:08:45.458 line:95%,end
we all have a pyramid in our head.

00:08:46.125 --> 00:08:47.927 line:95%,end
That pyramid sets it up.

00:08:47.994 --> 00:08:49.795 line:95%,end
The kids are standing right there.

00:08:49.862 --> 00:08:54.367 line:95%,end
So I feel like it's a really big lesson
in the way the world works.

00:08:54.433 --> 00:08:55.668 line:95%,end
You go to a cattle call,

00:08:55.735 --> 00:08:59.338 line:95%,end
you walk in, you stand on that line,
the famous chorus line,

00:08:59.405 --> 00:09:02.008 line:95%,end
yes, no, no, yes, no.

00:09:02.408 --> 00:09:03.643 line:95%,end
Nobody tells you why.

00:09:04.176 --> 00:09:07.513 line:95%,end
At least I'm explaining to the kids
why you're here.

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:09.515 line:95%,end
What did you do right?
What did you do wrong?

00:09:09.582 --> 00:09:12.251 line:95%,end
What happened? This is where you ended up.

00:09:12.318 --> 00:09:14.754 line:95%,end
Now, Christi, I can feel your energy.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:15.655 line:95%,end
-I can feel it.
-Oh.

00:09:15.721 --> 00:09:18.224 line:95%,end
JEFF: I know that you have
a very strong opinion about the pyramid.

00:09:18.291 --> 00:09:21.460 line:95%,end
I just think that it's one thing
when you are in a work environment

00:09:21.527 --> 00:09:23.162 line:95%,end
and you kind of see
the hierarchy of things.

00:09:23.229 --> 00:09:25.698 line:95%,end
I think it's a different thing
when you have little girls involved.

00:09:25.765 --> 00:09:28.501 line:95%,end
Our kids have done the pyramid
for many weeks now,

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:30.403 line:95%,end
and I still think that it's hurtful.

00:09:30.469 --> 00:09:32.471 line:95%,end
And I think there's other ways
to go about things.

00:09:32.838 --> 00:09:37.610 line:95%,end
I think the kids are smarter
than Christi is giving them credit for.

00:09:37.677 --> 00:09:40.713 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Although I am not
a fan of the pyramid, I will say this,

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:44.083 line:95%,end
it holds Abby accountable
for her thinking.

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:48.955 line:95%,end
So she can't just say it's in her head
or she can deny that she favors a child.

00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:53.159 line:95%,end
So you see it right there in front of you,
all the photographs, what she's thinking,

00:09:53.225 --> 00:09:56.095 line:95%,end
and you can hold her accountable,
whether you agree or disagree.

00:09:56.162 --> 00:09:58.364 line:95%,end
SINGER: <i>âª Living on the dance floor âª</i>


00:09:59.932 --> 00:10:01.634 line:95%,end
JEFF: Melissa, a lot of people think that

00:10:01.701 --> 00:10:05.237 line:95%,end
Abby plays favoritism to Maddie.

00:10:05.304 --> 00:10:07.206 line:95%,end
And obviously we know in the show

00:10:07.273 --> 00:10:10.009 line:95%,end
that Maddie ends up
at the top of the pyramid a lot.

00:10:10.376 --> 00:10:11.777 line:95%,end
ABBY: Maddie,
you're on the top of the pyramid

00:10:11.844 --> 00:10:13.245 line:95%,end
because you won a national title.

00:10:13.312 --> 00:10:15.047 line:95%,end
Again, it's Maddie.

00:10:15.648 --> 00:10:17.116 line:95%,end
Maddie. Maddie.

00:10:18.084 --> 00:10:18.951 line:95%,end
It's Maddie.

00:10:19.018 --> 00:10:22.622 line:95%,end
Second person on top of the pyramid
is also Maddie.

00:10:25.024 --> 00:10:28.594 line:95%,end
JEFF: Are you ever concerned
about Maddie's future

00:10:28.661 --> 00:10:31.430 line:95%,end
when someday she's not
at the top of the pyramid?

00:10:31.497 --> 00:10:32.365 line:95%,end
I'm really not concerned,

00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:34.400 line:95%,end
because she's not always
at the top of the pyramid.

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:37.536 line:95%,end
And Abby is strict with her
and tells her all of her flaws.

00:10:37.603 --> 00:10:40.539 line:95%,end
But sometimes Abby does it in private,
not in front of everybody.

00:10:40.606 --> 00:10:41.474 line:95%,end
JEFF: How do you guys feel?

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:44.677 line:95%,end
I think she's doing a disfavor to Maddie.

00:10:44.744 --> 00:10:48.781 line:95%,end
Anytime we have a competition or something
and Maddie doesn't win, she loses it.

00:10:48.848 --> 00:10:49.949 line:95%,end
She's not lost it.

00:10:50.016 --> 00:10:51.083 line:95%,end
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:53.686 line:95%,end
Like, we had a turn contest
at bootie camp.

00:10:53.753 --> 00:10:54.687 line:95%,end
-Right.
-Chloe won.

00:10:54.754 --> 00:10:56.022 line:95%,end
All of a sudden Maddie had a headache.

00:10:56.088 --> 00:10:59.191 line:95%,end
We had the watermelon contest
in Abby's pool.

00:10:59.258 --> 00:11:00.326 line:95%,end
Nia won.

00:11:00.393 --> 00:11:01.494 line:95%,end
All of a sudden, Maddie got hurt.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.929 line:95%,end
Like, she's never going to win
all the time.

00:11:03.996 --> 00:11:05.698 line:95%,end
-MELISSA GISONI: I know that.
-And I just think that--

00:11:05.765 --> 00:11:07.767 line:95%,end
-But that's her maturity level.
-KELLY: Letting your child think

00:11:07.833 --> 00:11:09.101 line:95%,end
that she's going to win all the time.

00:11:09.168 --> 00:11:11.170 line:95%,end
I think those are the kids
that end up anorexic

00:11:11.237 --> 00:11:14.106 line:95%,end
because the girl beside her got the part
because she was skinnier than she was.

00:11:14.173 --> 00:11:16.308 line:95%,end
I never tell Maddie
she's going to win, ever.

00:11:16.375 --> 00:11:18.644 line:95%,end
I mean, I don't.
And I--she works on her own.

00:11:18.711 --> 00:11:20.579 line:95%,end
I don't work with her on her routines

00:11:20.646 --> 00:11:22.148 line:95%,end
because I never pretend
to be a dance teacher.

00:11:22.214 --> 00:11:24.083 line:95%,end
JEFF: So while we're on
the subject of Maddie,

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:26.819 line:95%,end
for most of the season,
Maddie seemed absolutely unstoppable.

00:11:26.886 --> 00:11:30.456 line:95%,end
She's won crown after crown
at dance competitions around the country.

00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:34.193 line:95%,end
We don't know if it's her magnetic smile
or her emotional performances,

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.363 line:95%,end
but it seemed like nobody
could take their eyes off of her,

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:38.731 line:95%,end
especially you, Abby.

00:11:39.365 --> 00:11:40.700 line:95%,end
(indistinct chatter)

00:11:40.766 --> 00:11:43.436 line:95%,end
-I love you.
-ABBY: <i>That child works so hard.</i>

00:11:43.502 --> 00:11:47.106 line:95%,end
Maddie's solo is exquisite.

00:11:47.173 --> 00:11:48.040 line:95%,end
(applause)

00:11:48.107 --> 00:11:51.110 line:95%,end
MELISSA: <i>Maddie's choreography</i>
<i>and Chloe's choreography</i>

00:11:51.177 --> 00:11:53.379 line:95%,end
<i>were not even in the same stratosphere.</i>

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:56.749 line:95%,end
<i>I would say Maddie and Chloe</i>
<i>go back and forth</i>

00:11:56.816 --> 00:11:58.217 line:95%,end
<i>for the best dancer in the group.</i>

00:11:58.284 --> 00:12:00.886 line:95%,end
CHLOE: <i>I kind of wish Miss Abby</i>
<i>gave the same attention</i>

00:12:00.953 --> 00:12:04.123 line:95%,end
that she gave to Maddie
to the other girls and I.

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:07.126 line:95%,end
I guess she's setting us up
for another Maddie-Chloe showdown.

00:12:07.193 --> 00:12:08.461 line:95%,end
<i>It'll be the same old, same old.</i>

00:12:08.527 --> 00:12:10.830 line:95%,end
<i>You know, Abby will be working with Maddie</i>
<i>right before she goes on stage,</i>

00:12:10.896 --> 00:12:13.065 line:95%,end
and it'll be me in the back hallway
with my daughter,

00:12:13.132 --> 00:12:14.834 line:95%,end
because that's how it always is.

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:16.469 line:95%,end
<i>All the focus is on Maddie.</i>

00:12:16.535 --> 00:12:18.637 line:95%,end
And then there's nothing left
for anybody else.

00:12:18.704 --> 00:12:19.538 line:95%,end
Right.

There is not a tear shed

That's my issue.

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:32.451 line:95%,end
These are children,

00:12:32.518 --> 00:12:35.755 line:95%,end
and you cry for whatever reason
for one child and not the other?

00:12:40.626 --> 00:12:42.328 line:95%,end
You should be so lucky
to have Chloe as your student,

00:12:42.394 --> 00:12:45.397 line:95%,end
because she's a great dancer,
and everybody knows it, except for you.

00:12:45.865 --> 00:12:46.832 line:95%,end
I made her! I know it!

00:12:46.899 --> 00:12:49.668 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: You did not make her.
Were you pregnant for nine months?

00:12:49.735 --> 00:12:51.804 line:95%,end
I made her. You know what?

00:12:51.871 --> 00:12:54.206 line:95%,end
You couldn't have given
a (bleep) about her for so many years

00:12:54.273 --> 00:12:56.242 line:95%,end
when I sat up there
and I told her what to do,

00:12:56.308 --> 00:12:59.011 line:95%,end
because you were too busy
looking at everybody else.

00:12:59.078 --> 00:13:00.412 line:95%,end
Oh, who else was I looking at?

00:13:00.479 --> 00:13:01.914 line:95%,end
-Oh, let me guess.
-ABBY: Everybody.

00:13:01.981 --> 00:13:02.815 line:95%,end
Who?

00:13:02.882 --> 00:13:04.083 line:95%,end
Who else?

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:07.987 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>Abby does not put any value</i>
<i>on any child in her studio</i>

00:13:08.053 --> 00:13:10.122 line:95%,end
except for Maddie, and those kids know it.

00:13:10.189 --> 00:13:11.423 line:95%,end
And it is a shame.

00:13:11.857 --> 00:13:15.961 line:95%,end
So Christi, does that upset you
when you see Chloe say on tape

00:13:16.028 --> 00:13:18.130 line:95%,end
that she wished Abby spent
as much time with her

00:13:18.197 --> 00:13:19.098 line:95%,end
-as she spent with Maddie?
-Yeah.

00:13:19.165 --> 00:13:21.133 line:95%,end
Yeah, I also wished--
I think all the girls wished

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.502 line:95%,end
that Abby talked to them
like she speaks to Maddie.

00:13:23.569 --> 00:13:25.971 line:95%,end
She says to our kids,
"Why are you so stupid?

00:13:26.038 --> 00:13:27.273 line:95%,end
You're so stupid. You're so stupid."

00:13:27.339 --> 00:13:28.941 line:95%,end
To Maddie she says,
"You're smarter than that."

00:13:29.008 --> 00:13:31.277 line:95%,end
-Like--
-When Maddie comes in to work on a solo,

00:13:31.977 --> 00:13:34.513 line:95%,end
she is open minded.

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:38.918 line:95%,end
She wants to help along the choreography.

00:13:38.984 --> 00:13:42.721 line:95%,end
She is experimental, if you will.

00:13:42.788 --> 00:13:44.957 line:95%,end
She--and that face.

00:13:45.024 --> 00:13:47.593 line:95%,end
She just dances with her face first.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.728 line:95%,end
She has a great facility.

00:13:49.795 --> 00:13:50.663 line:95%,end
She has a beautiful body.

00:13:50.729 --> 00:13:53.032 line:95%,end
She should have a crown on her head
all the time.

00:13:53.098 --> 00:13:54.800 line:95%,end
You know, that's what you look at.

00:13:54.867 --> 00:13:56.569 line:95%,end
Every one of the kids are different,

00:13:56.635 --> 00:14:00.840 line:95%,end
and the way the relationship works, hey,


00:14:02.107 --> 00:14:04.910 line:95%,end
Maddie could graduate from high school,
and I could never hear from her again.

00:14:04.977 --> 00:14:07.012 line:95%,end
JEFF: Let me ask you about something
that the viewers thought was

00:14:07.079 --> 00:14:08.981 line:95%,end
pretty outrageous
and pretty controversial.

00:14:09.048 --> 00:14:10.482 line:95%,end
In one of the episodes,

00:14:10.549 --> 00:14:13.285 line:95%,end
you asked Melissa
to bring in Maddie's crowns.

00:14:13.352 --> 00:14:14.186 line:95%,end
Right.

00:14:14.253 --> 00:14:17.790 line:95%,end
And you displayed the crowns
in front of all the other girls.

00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:18.724 line:95%,end
ABBY: Starbound.

00:14:18.791 --> 00:14:19.925 line:95%,end
Ooh, that's pretty.

00:14:19.992 --> 00:14:21.393 line:95%,end
Energy.

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:22.294 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>Maddie still wins,</i>

00:14:22.361 --> 00:14:24.930 line:95%,end
just because she has better choreography
and Abby makes sure of that.

00:14:24.997 --> 00:14:26.866 line:95%,end
Every week, she makes sure

00:14:26.932 --> 00:14:29.268 line:95%,end
that Maddie has the best choreography
out of this group.

00:14:29.335 --> 00:14:32.037 line:95%,end
And you can sit here and get mad at me,
but you know it's true.

00:14:33.272 --> 00:14:34.173 line:95%,end
WOMAN: There's no question.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.374 line:95%,end
ABBY: GEA.

00:14:35.441 --> 00:14:37.042 line:95%,end
Running out of room.

00:14:37.109 --> 00:14:38.244 line:95%,end
What were you trying to teach them?

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:40.379 line:95%,end
ABBY: That it's not the crown.

00:14:40.746 --> 00:14:44.483 line:95%,end
It's the work you put in
to try to win that crown.

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:46.252 line:95%,end
Holly, you're rolling your eyes
at all this.

00:14:46.318 --> 00:14:49.655 line:95%,end
-What's going on?
-When you favor a child or a student,

00:14:49.722 --> 00:14:51.523 line:95%,end
it's hurtful for the other students.

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:52.925 line:95%,end
And it's clear that there are favorites.

00:14:52.992 --> 00:14:56.095 line:95%,end
And Abby's unapologetic
for having favorites.

00:14:56.161 --> 00:14:57.630 line:95%,end
-She can have her favorites--
-ABBY: And if your--if your--

00:14:57.696 --> 00:15:01.333 line:95%,end
not middle school, but in the high school,
do you not have a valedictorian?

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.869 line:95%,end
HOLLY: A valedictorian
is something totally different.

00:15:03.936 --> 00:15:05.671 line:95%,end
It's not the same.
It's not the equivalent.

00:15:05.738 --> 00:15:08.274 line:95%,end
Maddie is not a valedictorian. She's not.

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:11.744 line:95%,end
So Melissa, when Abby asked you
to bring those crowns in--

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:12.645 line:95%,end
I was not happy.

00:15:12.711 --> 00:15:14.880 line:95%,end
-After it was being done--
-ABBY: Let me interject.

00:15:14.947 --> 00:15:17.316 line:95%,end
I said, bring these crowns in,
and I want you to look back

00:15:17.383 --> 00:15:20.185 line:95%,end
at how hard you worked
and how important these were.

00:15:20.252 --> 00:15:22.288 line:95%,end
KELLY: She didn't want to
put those crowns on the table.

00:15:22.354 --> 00:15:23.455 line:95%,end
ABBY: Oh, absolutely.

00:15:23.522 --> 00:15:24.990 line:95%,end
Why do you people make her do it?

00:15:25.057 --> 00:15:28.294 line:95%,end
Why did her mother allow her
to pack up those crowns...

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.828 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I didn't know
what they were gonna do.

00:15:29.895 --> 00:15:30.763 line:95%,end
...and take them to the studio?

00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:33.098 line:95%,end
Because she knew it was going to hurt
every one of those kids.

00:15:33.165 --> 00:15:34.233 line:95%,end
Well, you must have had some idea.

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:36.001 line:95%,end
-No, I did not know.
-If I was her mother, I would have said--

00:15:36.068 --> 00:15:36.936 line:95%,end
ABBY: Let me tell you why.

00:15:37.002 --> 00:15:38.470 line:95%,end
-This is what started the whole incident.
-MELISSA: I had no idea.

00:15:38.537 --> 00:15:42.207 line:95%,end
We were at a competition,
and Maddie won a crown.

00:15:42.274 --> 00:15:46.345 line:95%,end
She no sooner sat back down on that stage

00:15:46.412 --> 00:15:49.048 line:95%,end
that she took that crown off
and gave it to somebody else.

00:15:49.114 --> 00:15:52.518 line:95%,end
Now, remember,
you have our six, seven children.

00:15:52.584 --> 00:15:55.454 line:95%,end
But behind them are 500 other kids

00:15:55.521 --> 00:15:58.691 line:95%,end
that would have chopped off
their right arm to win that crown.

00:15:58.757 --> 00:16:00.960 line:95%,end
So Maddie cannot behave like that.

00:16:01.026 --> 00:16:02.594 line:95%,end
None of my students can.

00:16:02.661 --> 00:16:04.630 line:95%,end
They need to show ownership.
They need to be proud.

00:16:04.697 --> 00:16:06.598 line:95%,end
They need to be thrilled
when they win that.

00:16:06.665 --> 00:16:08.100 line:95%,end
And she was not.

00:16:08.167 --> 00:16:11.003 line:95%,end
JEFF: It's a complicated,
sometimes rocky relationship

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:12.938 line:95%,end
that goes back over 30 years.

00:16:13.005 --> 00:16:14.239 line:95%,end
We may not know everything that went down

00:16:14.306 --> 00:16:16.809 line:95%,end
between Abby and Kelly
throughout their long history,

00:16:16.875 --> 00:16:20.212 line:95%,end
but we do know that
there was something about this season

00:16:20.279 --> 00:16:22.147 line:95%,end
that pushed them over the edge.

00:16:22.214 --> 00:16:23.315 line:95%,end
So take a look at this.

00:16:23.382 --> 00:16:24.984 line:95%,end
It's bad parenting, Kelly.

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:26.952 line:95%,end
She should have opened her mouth
and said, "Abby--"

00:16:27.019 --> 00:16:29.822 line:95%,end
Whether I was drinking or not,
it's none of her damn business.

00:16:29.888 --> 00:16:32.558 line:95%,end
Your kid doesn't want to dance.
They're lazy, and they don't like to lose.

00:16:33.425 --> 00:16:34.760 line:95%,end
You're playing with fire, Kelly.

00:16:36.628 --> 00:16:37.529 line:95%,end
Done.

00:16:37.596 --> 00:16:38.530 line:95%,end
(gasps)

00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:41.266 line:95%,end
KELLY: (bleep) you, Abby.

00:16:41.333 --> 00:16:42.568 line:95%,end
ABBY: You don't need them
for the competition.

00:16:42.634 --> 00:16:44.203 line:95%,end
I told you to do it for today.

00:16:46.171 --> 00:16:47.373 line:95%,end
-KELLY: You know what, Abby?
-ABBY: What?

00:16:47.439 --> 00:16:48.507 line:95%,end
KELLY: We're done.

00:16:48.574 --> 00:16:49.842 line:95%,end
You're not doing a solo.

00:16:49.908 --> 00:16:51.643 line:95%,end
Neither of my kids
are doing a group dance.

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:52.978 line:95%,end
-That's fine.
-KELLY: Okay?

00:16:53.045 --> 00:16:55.514 line:95%,end
-That's fine.
-(indistinct)

00:16:55.581 --> 00:16:58.951 line:95%,end
KELLY: I pay for costumes and props,
and I don't get them.

00:16:59.018 --> 00:17:03.322 line:95%,end
I've been here all day
making costumes for you,

00:17:03.389 --> 00:17:05.524 line:95%,end
while you were down the road eating.

00:17:05.591 --> 00:17:08.127 line:95%,end
Stop eating. That's why you're fat.

00:17:08.427 --> 00:17:09.261 line:95%,end
Goodbye.

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:13.065 line:95%,end
You told me at ten o'clock at night

00:17:13.132 --> 00:17:15.901 line:95%,end
that I needed stoppers for a chair
the next morning.

00:17:15.968 --> 00:17:17.036 line:95%,end
-Right.
-You know what, Abby,

00:17:17.102 --> 00:17:18.370 line:95%,end
I have three kids
that need to be at school.

00:17:18.437 --> 00:17:20.973 line:95%,end
ABBY: Your husband
that I keep hearing about.

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.241 line:95%,end
So tell him to go do something.

00:17:22.808 --> 00:17:24.877 line:95%,end
-KELLY: My husband works.
-Okay.

00:17:24.943 --> 00:17:27.079 line:95%,end
And you wouldn't know that,
because you live at home with your mom.

00:17:27.146 --> 00:17:28.514 line:95%,end
Right, I take care of my mom.

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:29.748 line:95%,end
People who have a family
have things to do...

00:17:29.815 --> 00:17:32.584 line:95%,end
-ABBY: And guess what, Kelly.
-...outside of dance.

00:17:32.651 --> 00:17:34.319 line:95%,end
When my mother was 17,

00:17:34.386 --> 00:17:36.188 line:95%,end
she paid the mortgage
on her parent's house.

00:17:36.255 --> 00:17:38.023 line:95%,end
KELLY: I don't really give a (bleep)
what your mother did.

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:39.391 line:95%,end
I'm talking about me.

00:17:39.458 --> 00:17:41.627 line:95%,end
I have a husband and I have three kids

00:17:41.693 --> 00:17:43.729 line:95%,end
and I have a home
that I am taking care of.

00:17:43.796 --> 00:17:45.764 line:95%,end
-Right.
-Dance is my extracurricular activity.

00:17:45.831 --> 00:17:46.799 line:95%,end
-ABBY: Right.
-At ten o'clock

00:17:46.865 --> 00:17:50.736 line:95%,end
when I got home,
going and buying stoppers was not in--

00:17:50.803 --> 00:17:53.605 line:95%,end
ABBY: So why didn't you just come to me
and say, "I can't"?

00:17:53.672 --> 00:17:55.340 line:95%,end
JEFF: When you threw the chair
on the floor--

00:17:55.407 --> 00:17:56.775 line:95%,end
I'd throw it harder.

00:17:56.842 --> 00:17:59.178 line:95%,end
-JEFF: You would?
-ABBY: It's my studio, my chair--

00:17:59.244 --> 00:18:02.147 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: That's a $68,000 floor,
and you're going to throw a chair on it?

00:18:02.214 --> 00:18:03.882 line:95%,end
SINGER: <i>âª Living on the dance floor âª</i>


00:18:05.484 --> 00:18:08.454 line:95%,end
JEFF: So Kelly, look, here's something
that everybody's wondering

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:12.558 line:95%,end
because of some of the things
that have happened over this last season.

00:18:12.624 --> 00:18:15.360 line:95%,end
So next season, are you in or are you out?

00:18:15.928 --> 00:18:17.996 line:95%,end
It's up for debate.

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:20.399 line:95%,end
-So you're not sure?
-I'm not sure now.

00:18:20.466 --> 00:18:22.401 line:95%,end
-JEFF: So there's--
-Oh, she told me she was not coming back.

00:18:22.468 --> 00:18:24.803 line:95%,end
So there's a chance that
we may not see you next year.

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:25.771 line:95%,end
You may not.

00:18:26.872 --> 00:18:28.107 line:95%,end
JEFF: So you're going to think about it
over the summer?

00:18:28.173 --> 00:18:30.042 line:95%,end
KELLY: Mm-hmm, my kids want to be back,

00:18:30.109 --> 00:18:32.678 line:95%,end
but I'm getting to the point,
I just don't know that it's worth it.

00:18:32.744 --> 00:18:36.982 line:95%,end
Paige is the most fun-loving child I know.

00:18:37.049 --> 00:18:40.486 line:95%,end
And I just feel like
that studio is breaking her spirit.

00:18:40.552 --> 00:18:42.354 line:95%,end
ABBY: I agree 100%.

00:18:42.421 --> 00:18:45.791 line:95%,end
When Paige and I are together
outside the dance environment,

00:18:45.858 --> 00:18:47.893 line:95%,end
she's a very nice, kind little girl.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.161 line:95%,end
We have no trouble.

00:18:49.228 --> 00:18:52.097 line:95%,end
Step inside that studio,
I expect more from her.

00:18:52.164 --> 00:18:53.065 line:95%,end
JEFF: All right. Well, let's do this.

00:18:53.132 --> 00:18:55.634 line:95%,end
We have a lot of fans
who have written some questions

00:18:55.701 --> 00:18:57.936 line:95%,end
that they would like to ask you ladies.

00:18:58.003 --> 00:18:59.271 line:95%,end
-So here's one from...
-ABBY: Oh, cool.

00:18:59.338 --> 00:19:03.075 line:95%,end
JEFF: ...from Julie from Massachusetts
who asks, Kelly,

00:19:03.142 --> 00:19:04.743 line:95%,end
you totally hit below the belt

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:07.479 line:95%,end
when you took shots at Abby's weight
and called her a whore.

00:19:07.546 --> 00:19:09.448 line:95%,end
I said, Kelly, go get a job.

00:19:09.515 --> 00:19:11.817 line:95%,end
KELLY: Oh, don't even go there, you whore.

00:19:11.884 --> 00:19:14.052 line:95%,end
Oh, you are a whore.

00:19:14.586 --> 00:19:17.289 line:95%,end
JEFF: Any regrets
over your choice of words?

00:19:17.356 --> 00:19:19.258 line:95%,end
KELLY: No, I do not regret
my choice of words.

00:19:19.725 --> 00:19:22.060 line:95%,end
Because when I called Abby a whore,

00:19:22.127 --> 00:19:23.962 line:95%,end
you didn't see what really happened.

00:19:24.029 --> 00:19:27.499 line:95%,end
Abby went below the belt,
talking about my family members.

00:19:27.566 --> 00:19:29.034 line:95%,end
But I don't know why
you would use that word.

00:19:29.101 --> 00:19:31.403 line:95%,end
I mean, why would you go
to that word directly?

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:33.572 line:95%,end
If I would have thought about it,
I would have called you a virgin.

00:19:34.173 --> 00:19:35.474 line:95%,end
ABBY: And that's a bad thing?

00:19:35.541 --> 00:19:36.775 line:95%,end
Just so your kids can hear it,
that's a bad thing?

00:19:36.842 --> 00:19:38.210 line:95%,end
-Yeah.
-Okay

00:19:38.644 --> 00:19:41.046 line:95%,end
JEFF: So Abby,
you and--you and Kelly grew up together.

00:19:41.113 --> 00:19:43.215 line:95%,end
You've known her
since you were two years old.

00:19:43.749 --> 00:19:46.118 line:95%,end
Yes, I danced for her mother,
since I was two and a half.

00:19:46.185 --> 00:19:48.053 line:95%,end
JEFF: Okay,
so what would you describe her--

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.421 line:95%,end
what was she like when she was a kid?

00:19:49.488 --> 00:19:54.593 line:95%,end
Beautiful, fun,
similar to Paige, a little dingy?

00:19:56.128 --> 00:19:56.995 line:95%,end
-Dingy?
-ABBY: Talented.

00:19:58.063 --> 00:19:59.298 line:95%,end
-Talented.
-JEFF: Right.

00:19:59.364 --> 00:20:00.465 line:95%,end
Fun.

00:20:00.532 --> 00:20:01.733 line:95%,end
Potential.

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:02.935 line:95%,end
Great potential.

00:20:03.001 --> 00:20:04.736 line:95%,end
JEFF: And what would you--
and what would you describe Abby

00:20:04.803 --> 00:20:05.671 line:95%,end
like when you guys were kids?

00:20:05.737 --> 00:20:07.005 line:95%,end
(chuckling)

00:20:07.072 --> 00:20:09.341 line:95%,end
Um, bossy.

00:20:10.275 --> 00:20:11.944 line:95%,end
-JEFF: Well, that hasn't changed.
-Mean.

00:20:12.711 --> 00:20:15.380 line:95%,end
But in all of that,
I think Abby taught me a lot.

00:20:15.447 --> 00:20:16.915 line:95%,end
-JEFF: Right.
-Like, I don't regret...

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:19.918 line:95%,end
a lot of the things
that I've done with Abby.

00:20:19.985 --> 00:20:21.520 line:95%,end
And I think that's probably
one of the reasons

00:20:21.587 --> 00:20:23.055 line:95%,end
why I brought my kids to Abby.

00:20:23.121 --> 00:20:26.291 line:95%,end
I mean, when I look back
at certain things that I do,

00:20:26.992 --> 00:20:28.260 line:95%,end
I think of Abby.

00:20:28.327 --> 00:20:31.697 line:95%,end
Just like, when I'm sitting somewhere,
my posture, like,

00:20:31.763 --> 00:20:35.000 line:95%,end
-I think of Abby telling me do this.
-(indistinct)

00:20:35.067 --> 00:20:39.238 line:95%,end
Or if I wear ankle strap shoes, you know,
Abby said that makes your ankles look fat.

00:20:39.304 --> 00:20:42.608 line:95%,end
Like, there's a lot of things
that I go back to that Abby has taught me,


00:20:42.674 --> 00:20:44.243 line:95%,end
even though she was mean.

00:20:44.309 --> 00:20:45.410 line:95%,end
JEFF: So let's move on.

00:20:45.477 --> 00:20:48.113 line:95%,end
Look, there's no denying
that out of all the dance moms,

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:51.016 line:95%,end
Melissa has the closest ties to Abby,
of course.

00:20:51.083 --> 00:20:53.752 line:95%,end
The other moms have accused you
of being a tattletale,

00:20:53.819 --> 00:20:56.521 line:95%,end
being manipulative, being brown-nosing.

00:20:56.588 --> 00:20:59.758 line:95%,end
But it was this CD skip heard
'round the world

00:20:59.825 --> 00:21:02.327 line:95%,end
that got the other moms really talking.

00:21:02.394 --> 00:21:03.595 line:95%,end
So let's take a look at this.

00:21:04.396 --> 00:21:05.764 line:95%,end
(mellow music playing)

00:21:05.831 --> 00:21:07.833 line:95%,end
MELISSA: No, no, the CD.

00:21:07.899 --> 00:21:09.835 line:95%,end
(cheers and applause)

00:21:09.901 --> 00:21:11.570 line:95%,end
ABBY: So I don't know
what happened with the CD.

00:21:11.637 --> 00:21:13.105 line:95%,end
It just scratched.

00:21:13.171 --> 00:21:14.006 line:95%,end
We need to move on.

00:21:14.072 --> 00:21:17.609 line:95%,end
KELLY: Abby has been in
the dance world long enough to know that

00:21:17.676 --> 00:21:19.678 line:95%,end
<i>when that happens you win.</i>

00:21:19.745 --> 00:21:21.980 line:95%,end
<i>So the second Maddie's music stopped,</i>

00:21:22.047 --> 00:21:23.482 line:95%,end
I knew what was going on.

00:21:23.849 --> 00:21:26.551 line:95%,end
So Melissa, here's your chance.

00:21:26.618 --> 00:21:29.054 line:95%,end
Did that conversation
between you and Kelly really happen?

00:21:29.121 --> 00:21:31.723 line:95%,end
Did you really tell Kelly that
Maddie knew the CD was going to skip?

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:32.624 line:95%,end
MELISSA: No, I did not.

00:21:32.691 --> 00:21:36.094 line:95%,end
She practiced to a CD, but not to that--
she practiced to an iPad.

00:21:36.161 --> 00:21:37.429 line:95%,end
Okay, but was she instructed
to keep dancing if something happened--

00:21:37.496 --> 00:21:39.031 line:95%,end
-ABBY: So was your two kids!
-Everybody's instructed--

00:21:39.097 --> 00:21:41.166 line:95%,end
Everybody's kids are instructed.

00:21:41.233 --> 00:21:43.969 line:95%,end
Something happens to your music, honey,
you just keep dancing.

00:21:44.036 --> 00:21:45.170 line:95%,end
My kid hasn't been told that
in the past year.

00:21:45.237 --> 00:21:46.371 line:95%,end
-ABBY: I think--
-I wanna know--hold on, hold on.

00:21:46.438 --> 00:21:48.373 line:95%,end
I swear on my children's life.

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:51.043 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I swear on my mother's grave
that I did not say.

00:21:51.109 --> 00:21:52.444 line:95%,end
No, go back and watch that clip.

00:21:52.511 --> 00:21:54.880 line:95%,end
Because Maddie never even hesitated.

00:21:54.946 --> 00:21:56.715 line:95%,end
Of course she didn't,
because she's a professional.

00:21:56.782 --> 00:21:59.217 line:95%,end
The music stops
when you're onstage, (indistinct)

00:21:59.284 --> 00:22:00.986 line:95%,end
Hey, knock it off.

00:22:01.053 --> 00:22:02.721 line:95%,end
You're messing with
my professional reputation.

00:22:02.788 --> 00:22:03.655 line:95%,end
KELLY: I don't care.

00:22:03.722 --> 00:22:05.123 line:95%,end
But if your daughter's music
would have stopped

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:06.725 line:95%,end
she would have kept dancing,
and you know that.

00:22:06.792 --> 00:22:08.360 line:95%,end
-Cuckoo.
-CHRISTI: Yeah.

00:22:08.427 --> 00:22:11.763 line:95%,end
In my experience, in the decade
that I've known both of these women,

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:13.131 line:95%,end
Kelly has never lied to me.

00:22:13.198 --> 00:22:14.633 line:95%,end
I can't say the same for Melissa.

00:22:15.701 --> 00:22:17.903 line:95%,end
JEFF: Christi, one of the things
that you said to me off camera,

00:22:17.969 --> 00:22:20.806 line:95%,end
you say that we never get to see
the fun that you guys have together.

00:22:20.872 --> 00:22:22.507 line:95%,end
-No, you don't.
-MELISSA: Exactly.

00:22:22.574 --> 00:22:24.609 line:95%,end
JEFF: Because we--we all understand
from watching the show

00:22:24.676 --> 00:22:26.278 line:95%,end
that you really do have a relationship

00:22:26.345 --> 00:22:28.613 line:95%,end
and that you really are close
and that you really do love each other.

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.415 line:95%,end
And what are some of
the most fun experiences

00:22:30.482 --> 00:22:31.717 line:95%,end
that you've had with these women?

00:22:31.783 --> 00:22:36.822 line:95%,end
Oh, my best memories of these women
have been my pregnancy with Clara.

00:22:36.888 --> 00:22:38.457 line:95%,end
That was great
that I shared it with these guys.

00:22:38.523 --> 00:22:40.359 line:95%,end
-What, our baby?
-It's our baby.

00:22:40.425 --> 00:22:42.494 line:95%,end
I mean, she is. She's everybody's baby.

00:22:44.129 --> 00:22:46.098 line:95%,end
Okay, little cup of tea.

00:22:46.164 --> 00:22:48.533 line:95%,end
I had a very hard time
getting pregnant a second time.

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:50.635 line:95%,end
I wanted a second baby more than anything.

00:22:50.702 --> 00:22:51.970 line:95%,end
I had given up hope.

00:22:52.037 --> 00:22:53.038 line:95%,end
I got pregnant with Clara.

00:22:53.105 --> 00:22:55.307 line:95%,end
Who were the first people at the hospital?

00:22:55.374 --> 00:22:57.209 line:95%,end
-Paige--Paige is in--
-Paige was the first one there.

00:22:57.275 --> 00:22:58.810 line:95%,end
My daughter was born,

00:22:58.877 --> 00:23:02.147 line:95%,end
and there's pictures of Chloe and Paige
holding my baby.

00:23:02.214 --> 00:23:04.683 line:95%,end
I mean, like, you know,
they brought me flowers.

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:08.387 line:95%,end
Holly's my neighbor.
You know, you don't see those things.

00:23:08.453 --> 00:23:11.022 line:95%,end
KELLY: Our kids, when they have free time,

00:23:11.089 --> 00:23:13.658 line:95%,end
they don't want to hang around
with their school friend kids.

00:23:13.725 --> 00:23:15.794 line:95%,end
They want to hang around
with their dance friends.


00:23:16.928 --> 00:23:18.930 line:95%,end
JEFF: All dance moms
have a different reason

00:23:18.997 --> 00:23:21.967 line:95%,end
that they choose this tough dance life
for their child.

00:23:22.033 --> 00:23:25.737 line:95%,end
But for Christi, her daughter dancing
at the Abby Lee Dance Company

00:23:25.804 --> 00:23:28.840 line:95%,end
is fulfilling a dream
she's always had for herself.

00:23:28.907 --> 00:23:29.741 line:95%,end
Take a look.

00:23:30.542 --> 00:23:33.345 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: When I was a little girl,
I dreamed of taking dance lessons.

00:23:33.412 --> 00:23:35.814 line:95%,end
And I lived with my grandparents.

00:23:35.881 --> 00:23:37.516 line:95%,end
<i>I moved back and forth on and off.</i>

00:23:37.582 --> 00:23:39.518 line:95%,end
And I danced on the lawn.

00:23:39.584 --> 00:23:42.187 line:95%,end
And I dreamed of having a life
like she does.

00:23:43.088 --> 00:23:46.958 line:95%,end
<i>Although I didn't have all those</i>
<i>same opportunities that Chloe had,</i>

00:23:47.025 --> 00:23:50.495 line:95%,end
my grandparents were able to give me
something that my mother didn't.

00:23:50.562 --> 00:23:52.164 line:95%,end
And that was unconditional love.

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:55.267 line:95%,end
(dramatic music playing)

00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:00.906 line:95%,end
I had a hard childhood.

00:24:00.972 --> 00:24:04.276 line:95%,end
You know, I wanted my children
to have every opportunity

00:24:04.342 --> 00:24:05.510 line:95%,end
that I never had.

00:24:05.577 --> 00:24:07.913 line:95%,end
And it's not just opportunities to dance.

00:24:07.979 --> 00:24:10.549 line:95%,end
It's an opportunity to go after
something that you love

00:24:10.615 --> 00:24:11.983 line:95%,end
and that you're passionate about

00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:14.953 line:95%,end
and have the full support of your parents
behind you.

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:17.222 line:95%,end
Chloe did soccer. She did basketball.

00:24:17.289 --> 00:24:19.124 line:95%,end
She did volleyball. She did the piano.

00:24:19.191 --> 00:24:21.293 line:95%,end
You know, she tried
a million different things.

00:24:21.359 --> 00:24:23.628 line:95%,end
And it was always dance
that she came back to.

00:24:23.695 --> 00:24:27.399 line:95%,end
I just want Chloe to be
so much of a better person

00:24:27.466 --> 00:24:29.334 line:95%,end
than I ever can be.

00:24:29.734 --> 00:24:31.269 line:95%,end
ABBY: She will go to the ends of the earth

00:24:31.336 --> 00:24:34.706 line:95%,end
to make sure that that kid
is at the right place at the right time

00:24:34.773 --> 00:24:36.341 line:95%,end
and looking the right way.

00:24:36.408 --> 00:24:40.345 line:95%,end
But I also think right now,
Chloe is her ticket out.

00:24:40.412 --> 00:24:44.916 line:95%,end
No, she's my ticket to raising someone
who I'm proud of.

00:24:44.983 --> 00:24:48.887 line:95%,end
And if you can't see that, shame on you,
because that's every mother's goal.

00:24:48.954 --> 00:24:51.389 line:95%,end
-Like--
-Yes, but you should also be teaching her

00:24:51.456 --> 00:24:53.458 line:95%,end
to be able to be independent.

00:24:53.525 --> 00:24:54.893 line:95%,end
That's every parent's job.

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:55.827 line:95%,end
Yes. Now, Abby--

00:24:55.894 --> 00:24:59.431 line:95%,end
So when you're gone
that she continues to live that way.

00:24:59.498 --> 00:25:01.900 line:95%,end
My daughter is independent.
She's just terrified of you.

00:25:01.967 --> 00:25:03.802 line:95%,end
-ABBY: When you keep saying that...
-CHRISTI: When you put her on the spot...

00:25:03.869 --> 00:25:05.403 line:95%,end
...then why do you come back?

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:09.107 line:95%,end
I would have left
had she not won that national title.

00:25:09.174 --> 00:25:10.842 line:95%,end
I would have left.

00:25:10.909 --> 00:25:13.778 line:95%,end
JEFF: So listen,
our moms have always questioned

00:25:13.845 --> 00:25:15.247 line:95%,end
Abby's creative vision.

00:25:15.313 --> 00:25:19.885 line:95%,end
But one particular ethnic solo
had Holly seeing red,

00:25:20.585 --> 00:25:23.154 line:95%,end
and it got everybody
talking about Laquifa.

00:25:23.221 --> 00:25:25.257 line:95%,end
-What?
-What?

00:25:25.323 --> 00:25:27.058 line:95%,end
JEFF: Let's take a look at
this Laquifa number.

00:25:27.125 --> 00:25:27.959 line:95%,end
What?

00:25:28.026 --> 00:25:29.528 line:95%,end
<i>They Call Me Laquifa.</i>

00:25:29.594 --> 00:25:30.428 line:95%,end
Gotcha.

00:25:30.495 --> 00:25:31.930 line:95%,end
SINGER: <i>âª They call me Laquifa âª</i>

00:25:31.997 --> 00:25:33.732 line:95%,end
<i>-âª I'm a post-modern--pin-- âª</i>
-SINGER: <i>âª What? âª</i>

00:25:33.798 --> 00:25:35.500 line:95%,end
SINGER: <i>âª They call me Laquifa âª</i>

00:25:35.567 --> 00:25:38.837 line:95%,end
<i>-âª I'm a post-modern-- âª</i>
-SINGER: <i>âª What? What? What? âª</i>

00:25:38.904 --> 00:25:40.405 line:95%,end
<i>âª What? What? What? âª</i>

00:25:40.472 --> 00:25:42.274 line:95%,end
HOLLY: She was wearing this '70s Afro wig.

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:43.575 line:95%,end
It just seemed so stereotypical.

00:25:43.642 --> 00:25:45.710 line:95%,end
It is stereotypical. Absolutely.

00:25:45.777 --> 00:25:49.247 line:95%,end
If I send her to an audition,
it's going to be an ethnic call.

00:25:49.314 --> 00:25:51.383 line:95%,end
It's like, there's a little
undertone of nuance

00:25:51.449 --> 00:25:53.318 line:95%,end
that is a little bit of a negativity.

00:25:53.385 --> 00:25:54.553 line:95%,end
ABBY: She doesn't have good feet.

00:25:54.619 --> 00:25:57.122 line:95%,end
She doesn't have great turnout.
She doesn't straighten her knees.

00:25:57.188 --> 00:25:58.323 line:95%,end
She's swayback.

00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:02.027 line:95%,end
I'm telling you very nicely,
pick the music, pick the choreographer.

00:26:02.093 --> 00:26:03.662 line:95%,end
To have my kid dress up in an Afro?

00:26:04.896 --> 00:26:09.100 line:95%,end
JEFF: So Holly, which part of that
was the part that really got you going?

00:26:09.167 --> 00:26:10.735 line:95%,end
Oh, the Afro heard 'round the world.

00:26:10.802 --> 00:26:12.737 line:95%,end
JEFF: The Afro heard 'round the world.

00:26:12.804 --> 00:26:16.675 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Look, I don't need an Afro wig
to show me that I'm Black.

00:26:16.741 --> 00:26:19.377 line:95%,end
And I don't need for Nia to think that
that makes her Black.

00:26:19.444 --> 00:26:21.513 line:95%,end
Her identity is bigger than an Afro wig.

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:24.482 line:95%,end
I think Nia is unique.

00:26:24.549 --> 00:26:26.618 line:95%,end
And I don't think
she has to be compromised

00:26:26.685 --> 00:26:29.955 line:95%,end
by portraying
a certain type of African-American.

00:26:30.021 --> 00:26:31.723 line:95%,end
I think we've come a long way.

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:34.259 line:95%,end
And it didn't really
celebrate any heritage.

00:26:34.326 --> 00:26:36.995 line:95%,end
I have no problem with ethnic dances.
I was in an African dance company.

00:26:37.062 --> 00:26:38.830 line:95%,end
I loved my experience with that.

00:26:38.897 --> 00:26:41.633 line:95%,end
What's your reasoning?
Why all the ethnic dances for Nia?

00:26:43.101 --> 00:26:44.569 line:95%,end
Because she's ethnic.

00:26:45.503 --> 00:26:49.307 line:95%,end
If I'm doing a Swedish dance,
I'm going to use Chloe and Paige.

00:26:49.708 --> 00:26:54.179 line:95%,end
But it's what they're going to win with.
It's their best shot at success.

00:26:54.245 --> 00:26:57.515 line:95%,end
And it's the Abby Lee Dance Company,
so I want to go in there and win.

00:26:57.582 --> 00:27:00.385 line:95%,end
For me to do that,
I felt that's what the music dictated.

00:27:00.452 --> 00:27:02.387 line:95%,end
I wanted it to be fun.

00:27:02.454 --> 00:27:03.855 line:95%,end
I wanted it to be exciting.

00:27:03.922 --> 00:27:06.858 line:95%,end
And like you said,
she's much bigger than the Afro.

00:27:06.925 --> 00:27:08.560 line:95%,end
But the Afro is big.

00:27:08.627 --> 00:27:09.628 line:95%,end
It made a statement.

00:27:09.694 --> 00:27:10.895 line:95%,end
Nia learned from it.

00:27:10.962 --> 00:27:12.497 line:95%,end
She learned to embrace it.

00:27:12.564 --> 00:27:14.366 line:95%,end
Whether Holly liked it or not,

00:27:14.432 --> 00:27:17.235 line:95%,end
whether Holly respects it or not,
I don't really care.

00:27:18.103 --> 00:27:19.037 line:95%,end
-WOMAN: We know.
-That's obvious.

00:27:19.104 --> 00:27:20.639 line:95%,end
ABBY: My job is to teach Nia
that these are the parts

00:27:20.705 --> 00:27:21.873 line:95%,end
she's going to go after.

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:23.541 line:95%,end
She wants to do this professionally,

00:27:24.209 --> 00:27:25.577 line:95%,end
-that's what she's going to do.
-JEFF: All right.

00:27:25.644 --> 00:27:28.013 line:95%,end
So Principal Holly
is the one mom in the group

00:27:28.079 --> 00:27:29.948 line:95%,end
who struggled with
balancing a full-time career

00:27:30.015 --> 00:27:32.017 line:95%,end
and a full-time competition season.

00:27:32.083 --> 00:27:34.552 line:95%,end
But there were times
that straddling both these worlds

00:27:34.619 --> 00:27:36.788 line:95%,end
didn't sit too well with you.

00:27:36.855 --> 00:27:38.223 line:95%,end
So let's take a look at this.

00:27:38.923 --> 00:27:40.825 line:95%,end
Parents worked hard to be here today.

00:27:40.892 --> 00:27:44.529 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Here, I think moms who don't work
probably have a more flexible schedule.

00:27:44.596 --> 00:27:46.131 line:95%,end
But you know that I work.

00:27:46.197 --> 00:27:49.200 line:95%,end
ABBY: I feel right now that I care more
about Nia's success than you do.


00:27:49.267 --> 00:27:51.202 line:95%,end
-No, you're--
-Your husband was here.

00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:53.304 line:95%,end
He walked right in the door.
Why didn't he stay?

00:27:53.371 --> 00:27:55.974 line:95%,end
-Abby, if you--
-ABBY: My dad even took me

00:27:56.041 --> 00:27:58.410 line:95%,end
to the mother-daughter
talk about getting your period.

00:27:58.476 --> 00:28:01.212 line:95%,end
My dad took me,
because my mother was at work.

00:28:01.279 --> 00:28:04.349 line:95%,end
Figure it out, because you know what,
the kid needs somebody.

00:28:04.416 --> 00:28:05.583 line:95%,end
-Abby, was I--
-She's not that swift.

00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:06.484 line:95%,end
HOLLY: How dare you?

00:28:06.551 --> 00:28:09.054 line:95%,end
You think you're up here
because you have a doctorate,

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:11.389 line:95%,end
-and everybody else is down here.
-That's your problem, Abby.

00:28:11.456 --> 00:28:13.391 line:95%,end
You are intimidated by me
because I have my doctorate.

00:28:13.458 --> 00:28:14.592 line:95%,end
Bull!

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:16.928 line:95%,end
So Holly,
during the evolution of the show,

00:28:16.995 --> 00:28:18.630 line:95%,end
we watched you get your doctorate.

00:28:18.697 --> 00:28:20.665 line:95%,end
-So hats off to you. Congratulations.
-Thank you.

00:28:20.732 --> 00:28:24.402 line:95%,end
JEFF: So because you've straddled
this fence back and forth,

00:28:24.469 --> 00:28:27.305 line:95%,end
does that mean that women can't do it all?

00:28:27.372 --> 00:28:30.742 line:95%,end
HOLLY: The demands of
a competitive dance team,

00:28:30.809 --> 00:28:32.243 line:95%,end
working full time,

00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:35.680 line:95%,end
and also maintaining
what was needed in our household,

00:28:35.747 --> 00:28:37.015 line:95%,end
I had to re-evaluate.

00:28:37.082 --> 00:28:39.584 line:95%,end
And I don't want working moms to think
that they can't have it all.

00:28:39.651 --> 00:28:40.719 line:95%,end
I think you can.

00:28:40.785 --> 00:28:43.455 line:95%,end
But you have to really evaluate what's
best for your interest for your family.

00:28:43.521 --> 00:28:47.125 line:95%,end
And for me, I thought as a working mother,
it's a great model,

00:28:47.192 --> 00:28:50.762 line:95%,end
not only for Nia, but the other girls
on a competitive dance team,

00:28:50.829 --> 00:28:52.697 line:95%,end
to see that you can have a career,

00:28:52.764 --> 00:28:54.733 line:95%,end
that you can be married
and have a household,

00:28:54.799 --> 00:28:58.369 line:95%,end
and still be there for your family
and doing whatever they need to.

00:28:58.436 --> 00:29:00.505 line:95%,end
JEFF: If you've ever wondered
what makes a good dance mom,

00:29:00.572 --> 00:29:02.741 line:95%,end
these ladies have shown
that good sewing skills

00:29:02.807 --> 00:29:05.210 line:95%,end
and a quick comeback are essential.

00:29:05.276 --> 00:29:07.712 line:95%,end
But for dance mom Jill Vertes,

00:29:07.779 --> 00:29:10.381 line:95%,end
a sexy 1-900 voice

00:29:10.448 --> 00:29:13.384 line:95%,end
and knowing how to storm out of a studio

00:29:13.451 --> 00:29:16.221 line:95%,end
are the qualities that make her memorable.

00:29:16.287 --> 00:29:18.056 line:95%,end
All right, Jill. Come on out.

00:29:18.123 --> 00:29:19.457 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:29:19.524 --> 00:29:21.693 line:95%,end
-JEFF: Wow.
-Hi, guys.

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:23.595 line:95%,end
Hello, everybody.

00:29:23.661 --> 00:29:24.696 line:95%,end
Did you miss me?

00:29:24.763 --> 00:29:26.664 line:95%,end
-Hi, Jeff.
-She really doesn't need a seat.

00:29:26.731 --> 00:29:27.932 line:95%,end
She doesn't stay long.

00:29:27.999 --> 00:29:29.734 line:95%,end
-Oh, I'm not going anywhere.
-(laughing)

00:29:29.801 --> 00:29:32.470 line:95%,end
So here's the question
that everybody seems to want to know.

00:29:32.537 --> 00:29:35.607 line:95%,end
Is she a studio hopper or a concerned mom

00:29:35.673 --> 00:29:37.475 line:95%,end
who just wants the best for her kid?

00:29:37.542 --> 00:29:38.643 line:95%,end
Judge for yourself.

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:40.478 line:95%,end
WOMAN: <i>She lives down the street,</i>

00:29:40.545 --> 00:29:42.213 line:95%,end
<i>and yet she drove an hour</i>
<i>in each direction.</i>

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:43.815 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>She's been to three studios</i>
<i>in six years.</i>

00:29:43.882 --> 00:29:45.884 line:95%,end
I don't think it's getting
tired of studios.

00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:47.185 line:95%,end
-Really? What have you heard?
-WOMAN: I think it's getting--

00:29:48.853 --> 00:29:51.456 line:95%,end
-(indistinct shouting)
-I'll pack my bags and go home right now.

00:29:51.523 --> 00:29:54.325 line:95%,end
Is that what--
would that make you guys really happy?

00:29:54.392 --> 00:29:56.394 line:95%,end
-No, that would not make me happy.
-JILL: Because that's what I'm doing.

00:29:56.461 --> 00:29:58.797 line:95%,end
-ABBY: And you know who's gonna lose?
-I'm sick of this (bleep).

00:29:58.863 --> 00:30:00.131 line:95%,end
-You--it's gonna be--
-I'm done!

00:30:00.198 --> 00:30:02.100 line:95%,end
It's going to be your daughter that loses.

00:30:02.167 --> 00:30:03.201 line:95%,end
-I'm done! Good for you.
-ABBY: It's your daughter.

00:30:03.268 --> 00:30:05.003 line:95%,end
JILL: We're done at Abby's.

00:30:05.069 --> 00:30:07.906 line:95%,end
I'm taking you somewhere
where they are going to appreciate you.

00:30:07.972 --> 00:30:11.342 line:95%,end
-CATHY: <i>Were you looking to join--</i>
-I need a studio.

00:30:11.409 --> 00:30:13.444 line:95%,end
You might want to just go ahead
and join with us.

00:30:13.511 --> 00:30:14.379 line:95%,end
-and become an Apple.
-JILL: Absolutely.

00:30:14.445 --> 00:30:16.247 line:95%,end
I need--I need fun.

00:30:16.314 --> 00:30:18.149 line:95%,end
I know you have a lot of students,

00:30:18.216 --> 00:30:21.686 line:95%,end
but if you can't give
my student enough time,

00:30:21.753 --> 00:30:23.721 line:95%,end
how can I continue to
keep bringing her to you,

00:30:23.788 --> 00:30:25.557 line:95%,end
when you can't give her the time of day?

00:30:25.623 --> 00:30:27.826 line:95%,end
I made a mistake going to Candy Apples.

00:30:27.892 --> 00:30:32.330 line:95%,end
And I would really like for you
to find a spot for Kendall on this team

00:30:32.397 --> 00:30:33.498 line:95%,end
like you did once before.

00:30:33.565 --> 00:30:35.567 line:95%,end
ABBY: Still the same old Jill.

00:30:35.633 --> 00:30:37.235 line:95%,end
All right, so when she went
to Candy Apples,

00:30:37.302 --> 00:30:39.704 line:95%,end
you said that that was
the ultimate betrayal.

00:30:39.771 --> 00:30:41.406 line:95%,end
So why did you take her back?

00:30:41.472 --> 00:30:42.607 line:95%,end
Because of Kendall.

00:30:42.674 --> 00:30:43.775 line:95%,end
Kendall is a good kid.

00:30:43.842 --> 00:30:45.777 line:95%,end
She's smart. She picks up quickly.

00:30:45.844 --> 00:30:47.545 line:95%,end
She's only nine years old.

00:30:48.213 --> 00:30:49.747 line:95%,end
And she's beautiful.

00:30:49.814 --> 00:30:51.716 line:95%,end
JEFF: Christi,
from the very first time you met Jill,

00:30:51.783 --> 00:30:53.017 line:95%,end
you said you didn't like her.

00:30:53.084 --> 00:30:55.353 line:95%,end
Someone said to me,
wait until you meet Jill.

00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:56.988 line:95%,end
She is the ultimate stage mom.

00:30:57.055 --> 00:30:59.524 line:95%,end
She will do absolutely
anything in her power

00:30:59.591 --> 00:31:00.925 line:95%,end
to get her kid ahead.

00:31:00.992 --> 00:31:02.026 line:95%,end
But, you know, I--

00:31:02.093 --> 00:31:03.862 line:95%,end
She just likes you
because you eat money out of men's pants.

00:31:03.928 --> 00:31:06.097 line:95%,end
-Well, that's what we (indistinct)
-(laughter)

00:31:06.164 --> 00:31:07.432 line:95%,end
Oh, what's that story?

00:31:07.498 --> 00:31:10.835 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: We went to a local establishment,
we'll say.

00:31:10.902 --> 00:31:13.638 line:95%,end
But next thing I know,
there's a very young man

00:31:13.705 --> 00:31:16.207 line:95%,end
who may be young enough to be your son

00:31:16.274 --> 00:31:18.543 line:95%,end
with a couple of twenties
sticking out of his waistband.

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:21.579 line:95%,end
<i>And Jill is taking them out of his waist</i>
<i>with her teeth.</i>

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:23.648 line:95%,end
-JEFF: <i>Whoa!</i>
-CHRISTI: <i>With her teeth!</i>

00:31:23.715 --> 00:31:24.782 line:95%,end
JILL: <i>I just got in there--</i>

00:31:24.849 --> 00:31:27.185 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>No, he offered it to me,</i>
<i>and I passed.</i>

00:31:27.252 --> 00:31:29.988 line:95%,end
And you told me to take the stick
out of my ass.

00:31:30.054 --> 00:31:31.689 line:95%,end
-(laughter)
-WOMAN: Yeah.

00:31:31.756 --> 00:31:35.927 line:95%,end
All right, so Jill, when Abby told you
to make a costume for Kendall,

00:31:35.994 --> 00:31:37.328 line:95%,end
you kind of cheated.

00:31:37.395 --> 00:31:38.763 line:95%,end
You used an old one.

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:41.466 line:95%,end
Do you feel that you bent the rules
a little bit there?

00:31:42.767 --> 00:31:44.836 line:95%,end
JILL: I'm going to be perfectly honest.

00:31:44.903 --> 00:31:47.705 line:95%,end
I did not bend the rules,
because every single one,

00:31:47.772 --> 00:31:49.874 line:95%,end
except Christi, used an old costume.

00:31:49.941 --> 00:31:51.342 line:95%,end
I don't care what they say--

00:31:51.409 --> 00:31:54.212 line:95%,end
You couldn't use a costume
from another studio, though.

00:31:54.279 --> 00:31:55.980 line:95%,end
-That was--
-But no, she didn't tell me that.

00:31:56.047 --> 00:31:57.815 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Yes, she did. Yes, she did.

00:31:57.882 --> 00:31:59.017 line:95%,end
She told all of us that.

00:31:59.083 --> 00:32:01.886 line:95%,end
HOLLY: And Nia did not use a costume
that she has worn before.

00:32:01.953 --> 00:32:03.221 line:95%,end
ABBY: I wanted you to do it.

00:32:03.288 --> 00:32:06.457 line:95%,end
And I was trying to teach the kids,
you can make do with what you have.

00:32:06.524 --> 00:32:07.992 line:95%,end
It's about your talent.

00:32:08.393 --> 00:32:10.495 line:95%,end
That was the lesson. You cheated.

00:32:10.995 --> 00:32:12.597 line:95%,end
We're going to have to agree to disagree.

00:32:13.097 --> 00:32:15.767 line:95%,end
JEFF: Okay, Jill's not the only one
who's been under fire.

00:32:15.833 --> 00:32:18.569 line:95%,end
Melissa came under a lot of scrutiny
by other moms

00:32:18.636 --> 00:32:20.605 line:95%,end
because of her personal life.


00:32:20.672 --> 00:32:21.873 line:95%,end
HOLLY: She's so forthcoming.

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:24.809 line:95%,end
She'll tell you anything about her body,
nooks, crevices,

00:32:24.876 --> 00:32:27.612 line:95%,end
desires, taboos.

00:32:27.679 --> 00:32:29.280 line:95%,end
-All that.
-(chuckling)

00:32:29.347 --> 00:32:30.281 line:95%,end
HOLLY: I lost my appetite.

00:32:30.348 --> 00:32:32.417 line:95%,end
I mean, I know that
she's cleanly shaved down there,

00:32:32.483 --> 00:32:34.686 line:95%,end
but she won't tell me she's engaged.

00:32:34.752 --> 00:32:36.654 line:95%,end
-Hello?
-That's a little too personal.

00:32:37.622 --> 00:32:40.024 line:95%,end
She's such a bitch.

00:32:40.091 --> 00:32:43.761 line:95%,end
JEFF: The moms threw you
an unwanted bachelorette party.

00:32:43.828 --> 00:32:47.098 line:95%,end
And they badgered you
about your engagement ring.

00:32:47.165 --> 00:32:49.534 line:95%,end
And you felt ganged up on. Why?

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.502 line:95%,end
I wanted to keep it private because...

00:32:53.104 --> 00:32:55.206 line:95%,end
my significant other
is going through a divorce.

00:32:55.673 --> 00:32:58.309 line:95%,end
So I didn't feel that it was necessary
to have it on TV.

00:32:58.376 --> 00:33:00.578 line:95%,end
JEFF: You actually had a lawyer
write a letter

00:33:00.645 --> 00:33:03.281 line:95%,end
to the other dance moms and tell them

00:33:03.348 --> 00:33:06.451 line:95%,end
that you didn't want them to talk about
your personal life on television,

00:33:06.517 --> 00:33:08.753 line:95%,end
or else you were going
to take legal action.

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:11.089 line:95%,end
I can't believe that
she sent a letter to all of us

00:33:11.155 --> 00:33:13.491 line:95%,end
from an attorney that was hired

00:33:13.558 --> 00:33:15.994 line:95%,end
to say that we're not allowed
to discuss her personal life.

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:17.895 line:95%,end
-And she's supposed to be our friend.
-Who does that?

00:33:17.962 --> 00:33:19.731 line:95%,end
What friend sends you
a letter from an attorney?

00:33:19.797 --> 00:33:22.667 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: And then if you do talk about it,
she threatens to sue you.

00:33:22.734 --> 00:33:24.736 line:95%,end
-Like, friends don't sue friends.
-Nope.

00:33:25.103 --> 00:33:27.872 line:95%,end
All of us felt like,
friends don't sue friends.

00:33:27.939 --> 00:33:29.741 line:95%,end
I did not sue you.
This is not my attorney.

00:33:29.807 --> 00:33:30.742 line:95%,end
It's Greg's attorney.

00:33:30.808 --> 00:33:34.078 line:95%,end
I would never go to a friend
and threaten legal action

00:33:34.145 --> 00:33:35.380 line:95%,end
-and still call you a friend.
-JILL: Wait.

00:33:35.446 --> 00:33:38.616 line:95%,end
Why did you get engaged
when he was still married?

00:33:38.683 --> 00:33:40.785 line:95%,end
-That's none of your business, Jill.
-JILL: If you had just waited until--

00:33:40.852 --> 00:33:43.054 line:95%,end
but I'm saying,
then none of this would have happened,

00:33:43.121 --> 00:33:44.956 line:95%,end
because that's what you were hiding.

00:33:45.023 --> 00:33:46.657 line:95%,end
-He's still married, and you're engaged.
-MELISSA: But that's not--

00:33:46.724 --> 00:33:49.861 line:95%,end
-I wasn't hiding that he was married.
-JILL: But, I mean, from the public--

00:33:49.927 --> 00:33:51.029 line:95%,end
that's what the problem is.

00:33:51.095 --> 00:33:52.330 line:95%,end
But that's why you didn't
want it on national TV.

00:33:52.397 --> 00:33:54.399 line:95%,end
If you just said, wait, honey,
till your divorce is final,

00:33:54.465 --> 00:33:55.900 line:95%,end
which you said
it would have been a year ago--

00:33:55.967 --> 00:33:57.068 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Well, maybe that's
what you would have done,

00:33:57.135 --> 00:33:58.569 line:95%,end
-but this is what we wanted to do.
-Well, I'm just asking.

00:33:58.636 --> 00:34:00.538 line:95%,end
-You could have--
-And it was a very special time for me.

00:34:00.605 --> 00:34:01.639 line:95%,end
It was wonderful.

00:34:01.706 --> 00:34:06.244 line:95%,end
And, you know what, the kids wanted it,
I wanted it, so we did that.

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:08.746 line:95%,end
KELLY: But that's why--
we knew you wanted it.

00:34:08.813 --> 00:34:11.416 line:95%,end
And, like, you said
you sent Paige a picture of it.

00:34:11.482 --> 00:34:14.052 line:95%,end
-Paige was so thrilled for you.
-MELISSA: I know she was.

00:34:14.118 --> 00:34:16.154 line:95%,end
But that's why
we talked about it with you.

00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:19.390 line:95%,end
We didn't think that
it was something wrong to talk about.

00:34:19.457 --> 00:34:20.458 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Because Paige texted me
on Christmas.

00:34:20.525 --> 00:34:22.427 line:95%,end
ABBY: But then what about
the very first time she asked you,

00:34:22.493 --> 00:34:23.494 line:95%,end
please don't talk about it?

00:34:23.561 --> 00:34:26.097 line:95%,end
-Why didn't it just go away?
-But why do you have to speak for her?

00:34:26.164 --> 00:34:27.565 line:95%,end
-You had nothing to do with it.
-ABBY: Well, I didn't--

00:34:27.632 --> 00:34:28.699 line:95%,end
-I didn't have an attorney.
-No.

00:34:28.766 --> 00:34:30.268 line:95%,end
But you know what,
this has nothing to do with you.

00:34:30.334 --> 00:34:31.903 line:95%,end
This is between the five of us.
It really doesn't.

00:34:31.969 --> 00:34:34.338 line:95%,end
-ABBY: But it affected my studio.
-MELISSA: No, it doesn't Abby.

00:34:34.405 --> 00:34:36.007 line:95%,end
-Yes, it does.
-MELISSA: But it's over now.

00:34:36.074 --> 00:34:38.376 line:95%,end
Because guess what?
He's going to be divorced in seven,

00:34:38.443 --> 00:34:40.411 line:95%,end
10 days, 14 days, 15 days, whatever.

00:34:40.478 --> 00:34:41.813 line:95%,end
-JILL: Good for you.
-ABBY: Maybe.

00:34:41.879 --> 00:34:43.281 line:95%,end
JILL: And how soon
are you getting married?

00:34:43.347 --> 00:34:44.549 line:95%,end
-Can we talk about that?
-As soon as we can.

00:34:44.615 --> 00:34:46.150 line:95%,end
-As soon as he's divorced.
-JILL: Yay!

00:34:46.217 --> 00:34:48.252 line:95%,end
-In any event, we're very happy for you.
-Thank you. Me, too.

00:34:48.319 --> 00:34:49.921 line:95%,end
JEFF: We're very happy
that you're in love again.

00:34:49.987 --> 00:34:51.422 line:95%,end
Are we coming to the wedding?

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:52.490 line:95%,end
Absolutely not.

00:34:52.557 --> 00:34:53.858 line:95%,end
(chuckling)

00:34:53.925 --> 00:34:55.860 line:95%,end
I was planning on surprising the kids,

00:34:55.927 --> 00:34:57.128 line:95%,end
but I don't know where
we're going to get married.

00:34:57.195 --> 00:34:58.696 line:95%,end
Can the cameras come?

00:34:58.763 --> 00:35:01.065 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I don't know about that.
I don't think Greg will allow that.

00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:03.634 line:95%,end
JEFF: So ladies,
I've got a question for you.

00:35:03.701 --> 00:35:07.038 line:95%,end
When I say the name Cathy
from Candy Apples,

00:35:07.105 --> 00:35:08.906 line:95%,end
tell me what pops into your mind.

00:35:09.774 --> 00:35:10.608 line:95%,end
Witch.

00:35:10.675 --> 00:35:11.809 line:95%,end
(scoffs) Holly?

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:13.678 line:95%,end
Silly.

00:35:14.512 --> 00:35:16.981 line:95%,end
Little shoes. Just... (makes sound)

00:35:17.048 --> 00:35:18.015 line:95%,end
-JEFF: Christi?
-Jerky.

00:35:18.816 --> 00:35:20.051 line:95%,end
-JEFF: Kelly?
-Stalker.

00:35:20.118 --> 00:35:22.120 line:95%,end
-JEFF: Jill?
-Annoying.

00:35:22.186 --> 00:35:24.722 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Frankly, when I'm out,
people will ask about Cathy.

00:35:24.789 --> 00:35:26.591 line:95%,end
-WOMAN: All the time.
-Tell me, what is she like?

00:35:26.657 --> 00:35:27.892 line:95%,end
And I just say, she's special.

00:35:27.959 --> 00:35:29.260 line:95%,end
Like, she's like a special...

00:35:29.327 --> 00:35:31.729 line:95%,end
KELLY: (indistinct)
is Cathy really that crazy?

00:35:31.796 --> 00:35:32.964 line:95%,end
WOMAN: It's almost like Cathy--

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:35.133 line:95%,end
HOLLY: She's like a cartoon character.

00:35:35.199 --> 00:35:36.734 line:95%,end
She's like the coyote. You know?

00:35:36.801 --> 00:35:38.102 line:95%,end
Like, you know they're never
going to catch Roadrunner,

00:35:38.169 --> 00:35:39.403 line:95%,end
but they're going to try
to throw an anvil on you.

00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:40.505 line:95%,end
That's exactly right.

00:35:40.571 --> 00:35:41.606 line:95%,end
JEFF: So Cathy, come on out.

00:35:41.672 --> 00:35:44.675 line:95%,end
-(laughter)
-(upbeat music playing)

00:35:45.977 --> 00:35:49.080 line:95%,end
(cheering)

00:35:49.147 --> 00:35:50.648 line:95%,end
-WOMAN: Sexy.
-CATHY: Hello.

00:35:50.715 --> 00:35:51.582 line:95%,end
WOMAN: Yes.

00:35:51.649 --> 00:35:53.317 line:95%,end
How's my little Pittsburgh babes?

00:35:53.384 --> 00:35:55.887 line:95%,end
JEFF: So Cathy,
let's just get right to it.

00:35:55.953 --> 00:35:58.623 line:95%,end
There were some very tense moments
that happened recently,

00:35:58.689 --> 00:36:01.192 line:95%,end
which we're all anxious to talk about.

00:36:01.259 --> 00:36:04.095 line:95%,end
-So let's take a look at this clip.
-WOMAN: Yeah, because I have no idea.

00:36:04.162 --> 00:36:05.730 line:5%,start
Oh, you're leaving?

00:36:05.796 --> 00:36:06.898 line:5%,start
-Yeah, we're leaving.
-WOMAN: All right. Let's go.

00:36:06.964 --> 00:36:07.999 line:5%,start
-CATHY: Yeah, bye-bye.
-Bye.

00:36:08.065 --> 00:36:09.066 line:5%,start
-Bye.
-Bye.

00:36:09.133 --> 00:36:10.401 line:5%,start
-WOMAN: Safe travels.
-CATHY: Bye, guys.

00:36:10.468 --> 00:36:13.671 line:5%,start
So, to sum up your trip
to Hollywood, California,

00:36:13.738 --> 00:36:15.439 line:95%,end
-failures!
-WOMAN: Keep going. Keep going.

00:36:15.506 --> 00:36:18.509 line:95%,end
(tense music playing)

00:36:19.844 --> 00:36:22.880 line:95%,end
Cathy, you're unbe-wee-vable!

00:36:22.947 --> 00:36:24.315 line:95%,end
Christi, enough.

00:36:24.382 --> 00:36:26.651 line:95%,end
She seriously just threw water on me?

00:36:26.717 --> 00:36:28.119 line:95%,end
(chanting) A-L-D-C! A-L-D-C!

00:36:28.186 --> 00:36:31.122 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Just because you're condescending
doesn't make you classy.

00:36:31.189 --> 00:36:32.957 line:95%,end
CATHY: You're nothing but a hillbilly.

00:36:33.024 --> 00:36:33.925 line:95%,end
Oh, yeah?

00:36:33.991 --> 00:36:35.626 line:95%,end
(indistinct shouting)

00:36:35.693 --> 00:36:38.729 line:95%,end
How classy is that?

00:36:39.764 --> 00:36:41.199 line:95%,end
What do you think, Cathy?

00:36:41.265 --> 00:36:43.634 line:95%,end
I think that Sparky over there
needed cooling down.

00:36:43.701 --> 00:36:45.403 line:95%,end
That's why the water went on her.


00:36:48.439 --> 00:36:51.609 line:95%,end
JEFF: From day one,
what is it about the two of you?

00:36:53.344 --> 00:36:58.015 line:95%,end
I think that we constantly see this
in everybody's face.

00:36:58.482 --> 00:37:00.952 line:95%,end
So that's why that happened.

00:37:01.018 --> 00:37:04.388 line:95%,end
I mean, screaming
and yelling about clean Chloe's clock

00:37:04.455 --> 00:37:07.458 line:95%,end
<i>and, you know,</i>
<i>Justice has been her two times in a row.</i>

00:37:07.525 --> 00:37:08.492 line:95%,end
<i>So, you know, you would be--</i>

00:37:08.559 --> 00:37:10.795 line:95%,end
KELLY: You were
the one out there chanting...

00:37:10.861 --> 00:37:12.330 line:95%,end
ALL: Clean Chloe's clock--

00:37:12.396 --> 00:37:14.498 line:95%,end
-And the whole Candy Apple chant.
-We weren't--

00:37:14.565 --> 00:37:16.000 line:95%,end
And we didn't come after you.

00:37:16.067 --> 00:37:18.803 line:95%,end
We did not know that
that was your dressing room.

00:37:18.869 --> 00:37:20.504 line:95%,end
KELLY: And you knew
we were at that competition.

00:37:20.571 --> 00:37:23.207 line:95%,end
That's why you were there.
That's why, Jeff, I called her a stalker.

00:37:23.274 --> 00:37:25.643 line:95%,end
-Because everywhere we go, Cathy's there.
-CATHY: Kelly...

00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:28.179 line:95%,end
Kelly, as far as I know,
it was an invitational,

00:37:28.246 --> 00:37:29.714 line:95%,end
and we were invited.

00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:32.950 line:95%,end
-So I think that the thing that we need--
-CHRISTI: What about the 50 other com--

00:37:33.017 --> 00:37:34.819 line:95%,end
CATHY: We don't come after you.

00:37:34.885 --> 00:37:36.821 line:95%,end
We just come to competitions.

00:37:36.887 --> 00:37:38.689 line:95%,end
We're not chasing after you.

00:37:38.756 --> 00:37:40.791 line:95%,end
ABBY: I don't know, Cathy.
It sure seems like it.

00:37:40.858 --> 00:37:43.961 line:95%,end
-There's over 800 dance competition.
-I think it's a coincidence, Abby.

00:37:44.028 --> 00:37:45.496 line:95%,end
-ABBY: In the United States.
-You know it's a coincidence.

00:37:45.563 --> 00:37:48.432 line:95%,end
Good, healthy competition

00:37:48.499 --> 00:37:51.602 line:95%,end
and good, healthy rivalry is fine.

00:37:51.669 --> 00:37:52.837 line:95%,end
But for some reason,

00:37:52.903 --> 00:37:55.273 line:95%,end
all of you turn it
into vindictive vicious.

00:37:55.339 --> 00:37:57.775 line:95%,end
ABBY: You're saying that good,
healthy competition is okay?

00:37:57.842 --> 00:38:00.344 line:95%,end
But why would you come to the studio
where we were?

00:38:00.411 --> 00:38:03.714 line:95%,end
There were 18 other studios
invited to the competition.

00:38:03.781 --> 00:38:06.584 line:95%,end
They weren't all rehearsing
right next door to me

00:38:06.651 --> 00:38:08.552 line:95%,end
in the other room, chanting about me.

00:38:08.619 --> 00:38:09.920 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: You know what,
there was a lot of emotions

00:38:09.987 --> 00:38:11.322 line:95%,end
running high that evening.

00:38:11.389 --> 00:38:12.890 line:95%,end
We obviously won and we beat you,

00:38:12.957 --> 00:38:14.492 line:95%,end
and you were just trying
to leave the building.

00:38:14.558 --> 00:38:15.926 line:95%,end
And then I think things escalated

00:38:15.993 --> 00:38:17.528 line:95%,end
because of all the feelings
that were going on

00:38:17.595 --> 00:38:19.263 line:95%,end
and the emotions from that week.

00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:20.731 line:95%,end
JEFF: What is it about the two of you?

00:38:20.798 --> 00:38:21.999 line:95%,end
It's like oil and water.

00:38:22.066 --> 00:38:23.901 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Uh, clearly we're not ever

00:38:23.968 --> 00:38:26.570 line:95%,end
going to call each other up
and go to lunch, clearly.

00:38:26.637 --> 00:38:30.341 line:95%,end
However, you know,
I appreciate a quick wit.

00:38:31.142 --> 00:38:32.777 line:95%,end
When I'm in a room with the two of you,

00:38:32.843 --> 00:38:34.679 line:95%,end
it's almost comical at times, because--

00:38:34.745 --> 00:38:35.813 line:95%,end
It is, Holly.

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:38.082 line:95%,end
-Uh-hmm.
-But excuse me, it upsets the children.

00:38:38.149 --> 00:38:40.284 line:95%,end
There's more to life than winning.

00:38:40.351 --> 00:38:42.153 line:95%,end
-And I feel very sorry for you--
-There's a lot more to life.

00:38:42.219 --> 00:38:44.055 line:95%,end
But you don't recognize any of that.

00:38:44.121 --> 00:38:45.523 line:95%,end
Yes, I do, Cathy.

00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:48.759 line:95%,end
CATHY: It seems like
the conversation always has to end with,

00:38:48.826 --> 00:38:50.061 line:95%,end
and we were winning.

00:38:50.594 --> 00:38:52.863 line:95%,end
Abby, I think I have way
more class than you do.

00:38:53.964 --> 00:38:55.966 line:95%,end
I think that you're a loud mouth.

00:38:56.033 --> 00:38:57.234 line:95%,end
(screaming) A loud mouth?

00:38:57.301 --> 00:38:58.502 line:95%,end
You were at the theater.

00:38:58.569 --> 00:39:00.271 line:95%,end
And I'm still apologizing for my behavior.

00:39:00.338 --> 00:39:01.372 line:95%,end
Oh, no, you're not!

00:39:01.439 --> 00:39:05.876 line:95%,end
JEFF: So Cathy, in the time that you spent
at the Abby Lee Dance Company...

00:39:05.943 --> 00:39:07.778 line:95%,end
-CATHY: Uh-hhm?
-JEFF: ...what did you walk away with?

00:39:07.845 --> 00:39:09.347 line:95%,end
(chuckling)

00:39:09.413 --> 00:39:12.583 line:95%,end
Abby clearly has
different tactics than I do.

00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:14.652 line:95%,end
I am very nurturing.

00:39:14.719 --> 00:39:16.787 line:95%,end
She is very aggressive.

00:39:16.854 --> 00:39:20.224 line:95%,end
She is not nice to her customers.

00:39:20.291 --> 00:39:21.692 line:95%,end
I think that one of the reasons

00:39:21.759 --> 00:39:25.096 line:95%,end
why I have much more clientele
at my studio

00:39:25.162 --> 00:39:27.865 line:95%,end
is because I'm a businessperson
as well as a--

00:39:27.932 --> 00:39:31.035 line:95%,end
I'm not done, so close your mouth
and pull your finger back.

00:39:31.102 --> 00:39:32.269 line:95%,end
-ABBY: Business first, talent second.
-CATHY: Pull your finger back.

00:39:32.336 --> 00:39:34.338 line:95%,end
-I'm the other way around.
-CATHY: No, that's not true.

00:39:34.405 --> 00:39:38.809 line:95%,end
And I think that
the mothers deserve respect.

00:39:38.876 --> 00:39:42.313 line:95%,end
I don't think that the mothers
should be annihilated.

00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:45.282 line:95%,end
I don't think that
the mothers should be accountable

00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:49.787 line:95%,end
for having to go get props,
having to rhinestone costumes.

00:39:49.854 --> 00:39:52.823 line:95%,end
Abby is very good at what she does,

00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:55.126 line:95%,end
and Abby does produce fine talent.

00:39:55.192 --> 00:39:56.494 line:95%,end
So I'm going to give Abby kudos.

00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:58.629 line:95%,end
We've known each other
for quite some time,

00:39:58.696 --> 00:40:00.398 line:95%,end
and we may not always win,

00:40:00.464 --> 00:40:05.169 line:95%,end
but we win enough that you know
we do create a good competition for you.

00:40:05.236 --> 00:40:06.437 line:95%,end
All right, so on that note,

00:40:06.504 --> 00:40:08.539 line:95%,end
I want to thank all you ladies
for coming tonight.

00:40:08.606 --> 00:40:10.608 line:95%,end
That's all we've got time for this week.

00:40:10.674 --> 00:40:14.712 line:95%,end
Next time, the <i>Dance Moms</i> reunion
continues in part two.

00:40:14.779 --> 00:40:16.614 line:95%,end
We'll be talking much more with Cathy,

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:19.383 line:95%,end
plus more questions from <i>Dance Moms</i> fans.

00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:20.284 line:95%,end
Don't miss it.

00:40:20.351 --> 00:40:22.119 line:95%,end
Good night, everybody. Enjoy.

00:40:23.154 --> 00:40:25.589 line:95%,end
SINGER: <i>âª Living on the dance floor âª</i>

00:40:26.223 --> 00:40:27.525 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>Next on</i> Dance Moms...

00:40:27.591 --> 00:40:28.793 line:95%,end
What's your problem with me?

00:40:28.859 --> 00:40:32.196 line:95%,end
You're doing the same thing to your kids
that your mom and dad did to you.

00:40:32.263 --> 00:40:35.833 line:95%,end
Maybe someday say, you know what, Paige,
someday you will be able to be a Rockette.

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:39.136 line:95%,end
I've said it to her
over and over and over again.

00:40:40.004 --> 00:40:43.207 line:5%,start
The Candy Apple dancers
have only beat Abby's group once.

00:40:43.274 --> 00:40:44.675 line:5%,start
Could it be that
she's just better than you?

00:40:44.742 --> 00:40:46.677 line:5%,start
CATHY: Um, hmm.

00:40:47.711 --> 00:40:50.147 line:5%,start
JEFF: Please welcome Kaya.

00:40:51.315 --> 00:40:53.150 line:5%,start
KAYA: I mean, from the day
I walked in there,

00:40:53.217 --> 00:40:54.218 line:5%,start
it's like you had an issue with me.

00:40:54.285 --> 00:40:56.220 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: I don't know why
she would just get to walk in and be on

00:40:56.287 --> 00:40:57.955 line:5%,start
it when there's other kids
who have had to go through--

00:40:58.022 --> 00:40:59.824 line:5%,start
Other kids don't have a resume like hers.

00:41:00.357 --> 00:41:02.426 line:5%,start
We're going to have to just agree
that we disagree.

00:41:02.493 --> 00:41:04.228 line:5%,start
You've been crossing the line
ever since the show started.

00:41:04.295 --> 00:41:05.129 line:5%,start
All of you have.

00:41:05.196 --> 00:41:07.465 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: Don't let the door
hit your (bleep) on the way out, then.

00:41:07.531 --> 00:41:09.066 line:5%,start
But you are just one bitter bitch.
