CATHY: <i>Abby Lee draws on abs?</i>

00:00:04.904 --> 00:00:06.006 line:5%,start
We have real abs.

00:00:06.072 --> 00:00:09.175 line:5%,start
Did you stand in the wings

<i>The bigger one in the middle,</i>

MELISSA: And she doesn't seem like
she was from Cathy's studio at all.

00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:15.949 line:5%,start
Exactly.

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:17.317 line:5%,start
She's at least 15.

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:19.152 line:5%,start
How old is Erica and her date of birth?

00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:21.087 line:5%,start
-Erica is 14.
-WOMAN: Correct.

00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:22.422 line:5%,start
She is in the wrong age division.

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:25.658 line:5%,start
I look like an idiot,
that I just can't win on our own talent.

ABBY: Things are going to be a little bit
different this time.

Maddie and Chloe will go head to head.

Boo. The Abby Lee Dance Company.

Boo.

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:48.148 line:5%,start
I know you like to dance,
but could be something new

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:49.149 line:5%,start
if you're over it.

Yell out your colors.

00:00:50.984 --> 00:00:53.319 line:5%,start
Panthers blue and gold.

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:54.854 line:5%,start
ABBY: She should
have opened her mouth and said,

00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:58.024 line:5%,start
Abby, that is a mature 13-year-old.

00:00:58.091 --> 00:01:01.061 line:5%,start
We're trying to stand
behind Brooke in her decision.

Come on. Let's go.

00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:23.616 line:95%,end
Let's have a big round of applause.

00:01:23.683 --> 00:01:25.218 line:95%,end
(applause)

00:01:25.285 --> 00:01:27.020 line:95%,end
I think we made applesauce, don't you?

(laughing)

00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:30.990 line:95%,end
ABBY: Now, the group won.
They won the overall.

00:01:31.057 --> 00:01:33.660 line:95%,end
But you know what?
That was one competition.

00:01:33.726 --> 00:01:36.930 line:95%,end
For this week, we are going
to Starbound in New Jersey.

00:01:36.996 --> 00:01:40.266 line:95%,end
We walk into Starbound,
you need to be those national champions.

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:42.936 line:95%,end
All right, on the bottom...

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.972 line:95%,end
Nia, simply because of the mistake

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.906 line:95%,end
in the choreography.

00:01:46.973 --> 00:01:49.742 line:95%,end
(muted music playing)

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:51.344 line:95%,end
(intense music playing)

00:01:51.411 --> 00:01:53.046 line:95%,end
And that dance is easy.

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:54.180 line:95%,end
It's simple.

00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:56.249 line:95%,end
NIA: <i>I'm sad that I'm last this week</i>

00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:59.018 line:5%,start
because I worked really hard
to get to the top,

00:01:59.085 --> 00:02:01.988 line:5%,start
and I went back to the bottom.

00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:03.857 line:95%,end
ABBY: Next I have Kendall.

00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:07.026 line:95%,end
You need to learn to read music,
and you need

00:02:07.093 --> 00:02:08.528 line:95%,end
to learn to hear the music.

00:02:08.595 --> 00:02:12.432 line:5%,start
Kendall did a big no-no
in the group dance.

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:13.600 line:95%,end
<i>Totally off the music.</i>

00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:15.702 line:95%,end
<i>She started four counts</i>
<i>ahead of everyone else.</i>

00:02:15.768 --> 00:02:17.704 line:95%,end
8I'm going to keep her on probation.

00:02:18.371 --> 00:02:21.841 line:95%,end
Until I hand her that jacket,
she's still proving herself.

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:24.978 line:95%,end
Paige, I've seen you do the press better.

00:02:25.044 --> 00:02:26.613 line:95%,end
I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt.

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:27.981 line:95%,end
I thought you did a nice job.

00:02:28.047 --> 00:02:30.850 line:95%,end
Next, MacKenzie.

00:02:30.917 --> 00:02:34.087 line:95%,end
This week, you are not in the group.

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:36.256 line:95%,end
You are going to do a solo.

00:02:36.856 --> 00:02:40.727 line:95%,end
All right.
Next I have Maddie.

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:45.465 line:95%,end
You were the highest scoring number

00:02:45.532 --> 00:02:47.000 line:95%,end
in the entire competition.

00:02:47.066 --> 00:02:48.635 line:95%,end
Why do you think you're not on the top?

00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:51.404 line:95%,end
MADDIE: <i>I actually want someone else</i>
<i>to be on the top</i>

00:02:51.471 --> 00:02:55.074 line:95%,end
<i>because I want someone else</i>
<i>to see what that feels</i>

00:02:55.141 --> 00:02:59.245 line:5%,start
like, and be really happy, and getting
the star of the group dance.

00:02:59.312 --> 00:03:02.382 line:95%,end
ABBY: I want you to stop resting
on your laurels.

00:03:02.448 --> 00:03:05.652 line:95%,end
I want you to keep improving
for the next 20 years,

00:03:05.718 --> 00:03:07.187 line:95%,end
not for one competition.

00:03:07.253 --> 00:03:08.521 line:95%,end
Do you understand?

00:03:08.588 --> 00:03:10.256 line:95%,end
So, you impressed them.

00:03:10.323 --> 00:03:11.824 line:95%,end
I want you to impress me.

00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:14.027 line:5%,start
Maddie really should have been
on top of the pyramid this week

00:03:14.093 --> 00:03:15.128 line:5%,start
because she won.

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:17.697 line:95%,end
<i>I feel that Abby just wants</i>
<i>to give other kids a chance</i>

00:03:17.764 --> 00:03:18.932 line:95%,end
<i>on the pyramid.</i>

00:03:18.998 --> 00:03:22.001 line:95%,end
<i>She had to, of course,</i>
<i>make a little comment to Maddie,</i>

00:03:22.068 --> 00:03:24.637 line:95%,end
but I'm sure it had nothing to do
with her dance skills.

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:26.773 line:95%,end
Next I have Chloe.

00:03:27.507 --> 00:03:29.075 line:95%,end
Chloe, you didn't do a solo last week.

00:03:29.142 --> 00:03:30.510 line:95%,end
You were great in the group.

00:03:30.577 --> 00:03:32.512 line:95%,end
People are recognizing you
from the video,

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.048 line:95%,end
but I want them to recognize you
for your dancing.

00:03:35.114 --> 00:03:36.382 line:95%,end
Understood?

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:38.785 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>This is the first time Chloe</i>
<i>has ever been above Maddie</i>

00:03:38.851 --> 00:03:41.554 line:5%,start
on the pyramid.
So it's like, celebration day.

00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:43.056 line:5%,start
Ice cream for everyone!

00:03:43.122 --> 00:03:46.125 line:95%,end
And on top of the pyramid
this week is Brooke.

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:49.028 line:95%,end
You went out there.
You proved yourself.

00:03:49.095 --> 00:03:51.965 line:95%,end
I mean, you went from worst
to best in one week.

00:03:52.031 --> 00:03:54.234 line:5%,start
I think being at the top
means something to Brooke.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.036 line:5%,start
I mean, I think it means something
to every one of those kids.

00:03:57.103 --> 00:03:58.571 line:95%,end
<i>You know, Brooke felt proud of herself</i>

00:03:58.638 --> 00:04:00.440 line:95%,end
<i>for finally making it to the top.</i>

00:04:00.506 --> 00:04:03.276 line:95%,end
<i>And that really made me feel happy.</i>

00:04:03.343 --> 00:04:05.211 line:95%,end
ABBY: You're the oldest
person in this group.

00:04:05.278 --> 00:04:06.479 line:95%,end
You need to be the role model.

00:04:06.546 --> 00:04:07.880 line:95%,end
And that needs to continue.

00:04:07.947 --> 00:04:10.817 line:95%,end
BROOKE: <i>Abby wants me to be a role model</i>
<i>for all the other girls,</i>

00:04:10.883 --> 00:04:13.620 line:5%,start
but I really don't know if I want
to be a role model for them.

00:04:13.686 --> 00:04:17.557 line:95%,end
MacKenzie, you're doing
a routine called My Parade,

00:04:17.624 --> 00:04:19.425 line:95%,end
and it's all about you, kiddo.

00:04:19.492 --> 00:04:20.994 line:95%,end
You're going to March out from that corner

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.962 line:95%,end
like you're the leader of the big parade.

00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:26.833 line:95%,end
Maddie, this week you're going
to be doing a jazz routine

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:28.868 line:95%,end
to <i>Lights Camera, Action.</i>

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:31.604 line:95%,end
Chloe, you're going to be doing
a lyrical routine

00:04:31.671 --> 00:04:33.239 line:95%,end
to<i> Don't Catch Me.</i>

00:04:33.306 --> 00:04:35.275 line:95%,end
Things are going to be a
little bit different this time.

00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:37.043 line:95%,end
<i>Maddie and Chloe will go head to head,</i>

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.479 line:95%,end
<i>so there's a lot at stake.</i>

00:04:39.545 --> 00:04:42.548 line:95%,end
Chloe's so happy
she's having a lyrical solo.

00:04:42.615 --> 00:04:45.385 line:95%,end
CHRISTI:<i> So once again,</i>
<i>you know, my daughter's</i>

<i>put head to head with Maddie.</i>

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:48.554 line:95%,end
<i>But Chloe can beat Maddie.</i>

00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:51.357 line:95%,end
If she would just go out there
and perform the piece

00:04:51.424 --> 00:04:53.960 line:95%,end
as we know she can, she will be fine.

00:04:54.027 --> 00:04:57.263 line:95%,end
Now, the group dance
that everybody's in except MacKenzie


00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.301 line:95%,end
is<i> Born to Dance,</i>
and it's about a child being born.

00:05:01.868 --> 00:05:03.503 line:95%,end
There's a little mystery to it.

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:05.405 line:95%,end
CHRISTI:
<i>These are little girls, and I'm not sure</i>

00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:07.607 line:95%,end
<i>that we should be bringing up</i>
<i>the birds and the bees.</i>

00:05:07.674 --> 00:05:09.709 line:95%,end
That's health class, not dance class.

00:05:09.776 --> 00:05:11.511 line:95%,end
ABBY: Brooke, you're going to
be featured in this number,

00:05:11.577 --> 00:05:14.280 line:95%,end
but you should be the glue
that's holding it together.

00:05:14.347 --> 00:05:17.383 line:95%,end
And Maddie has been the glue
that's holding it together.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.118 line:95%,end
You need to be the most advanced one
in the group,

00:05:19.185 --> 00:05:21.421 line:95%,end
not looking around to see
what these two are doing.

00:05:21.487 --> 00:05:22.789 line:95%,end
Understood?

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:25.692 line:95%,end
Brooke, don't let me down.

00:05:27.093 --> 00:05:29.862 line:95%,end
Moms, please go.
Girls, stretch out. Let's go.

Bring back electricity!

don't need to be exposed

to things too early.

00:06:26.686 --> 00:06:28.721 line:95%,end
I like that they're young,

CHRISTI: <i>I think that Chloe</i>

00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:07.219 line:95%,end

her a run for her money.

we're leaving for competition.

We have 45 minutes to work
on this dance, and that's it.

00:13:15.861 --> 00:13:17.062 line:95%,end
You will be on stage.

00:13:17.129 --> 00:13:18.030 line:95%,end
Understood?

00:13:18.097 --> 00:13:19.331 line:95%,end
All right, let's go.

00:13:19.398 --> 00:13:21.734 line:95%,end
(dance music playing)

00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:22.868 line:95%,end
Head up.

00:13:22.935 --> 00:13:24.537 line:95%,end
Kendall, you're right behind Chloe.

00:13:24.603 --> 00:13:25.938 line:95%,end
You should be beyond her.

00:13:27.039 --> 00:13:28.073 line:95%,end
Stop!

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:29.441 line:95%,end
Where's Brooke?


00:13:33.112 --> 00:13:35.114 line:95%,end
I'm really not sure if Brooke wants

00:13:35.181 --> 00:13:36.582 line:95%,end
to be part of our group still.

a teenager is all about.

Hello ladies.

DANCE MOMS: Hi!

00:13:47.059 --> 00:13:49.595 line:95%,end
Well, we filled Holly in.

HOLLY: I'm shocked just finding out
that Brooke isn't going to be here

00:13:52.731 --> 00:13:55.401 line:5%,start
for this number,
and I know Abby doesn't know that,

00:13:55.467 --> 00:13:58.304 line:95%,end

<i>once Abby finds out,</i>

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:00.172 line:95%,end
she is going to lose it.

00:14:00.239 --> 00:14:02.041 line:95%,end
Oh!

00:14:02.641 --> 00:14:04.410 line:95%,end
She's gonna be really mad.

00:14:04.476 --> 00:14:06.378 line:95%,end
I've never seen you back down to Abby.

00:14:06.445 --> 00:14:07.613 line:95%,end
Absolutely.

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.516 line:95%,end
Maddie, turn the leg out!

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:12.818 line:95%,end
What is wrong with you?

00:14:12.885 --> 00:14:13.786 line:95%,end
Oh, my God.

00:14:13.853 --> 00:14:15.754 line:95%,end
You better get down there
before it gets worse.

00:14:15.821 --> 00:14:16.755 line:95%,end
Brooke!

KELLY: What's she yelling?

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:20.359 line:95%,end
-Uh oh, she's calling Brooke.
-Brooke!

for our competition team members:

00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:27.032 line:95%,end
you must be present at the rehearsal

00:14:27.099 --> 00:14:28.801 line:95%,end

00:14:28.868 --> 00:14:31.170 line:95%,end

<i>the last time we run that number,</i>

00:14:33.272 --> 00:14:35.140 line:95%,end
<i>that's how we're going to do it on stage.</i>

00:14:35.207 --> 00:14:37.109 line:95%,end
Let me go find out where Brooke is.

00:14:37.176 --> 00:14:38.677 line:95%,end
I'm going to chew her mother out.

00:14:39.211 --> 00:14:40.179 line:95%,end
Kelly?

00:14:40.246 --> 00:14:41.647 line:95%,end
Yeah?

00:14:41.714 --> 00:14:44.083 line:95%,end
ABBY: I need to know
what's going on with Brooke.

00:14:45.451 --> 00:14:47.219 line:95%,end
You're too high.
Don't pick them up that high.

00:14:47.286 --> 00:14:48.354 line:95%,end
Where is Brooke?

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:50.356 line:95%,end
Well, that's what
I want to talk to you about.

00:14:50.422 --> 00:14:52.224 line:95%,end
I don't think
she's coming this weekend.

00:14:52.291 --> 00:14:55.060 line:95%,end
(intensifying music playing)

00:14:55.127 --> 00:14:57.897 line:95%,end
KELLY: We had a long discussion,
and there's something that came up

00:14:57.963 --> 00:14:59.965 line:95%,end
at school that she wants to do.

00:15:00.766 --> 00:15:02.534 line:95%,end
And I'm going to allow her to do it.

00:15:03.235 --> 00:15:05.237 line:95%,end
-Uh-oh. Wait a second.
-Uh huh.

00:15:06.038 --> 00:15:07.673 line:95%,end
So she's out.

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:10.342 line:95%,end
You're making a decision for me
and for everybody

00:15:10.409 --> 00:15:11.243 line:95%,end
in this group.

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:14.546 line:95%,end
You're letting a 13-year-old kid dictate

00:15:14.613 --> 00:15:16.682 line:95%,end
my future and their future.

00:15:17.583 --> 00:15:20.719 line:95%,end
But I'm letting
my 13-year-old dictate her future.

00:15:20.786 --> 00:15:22.922 line:95%,end
She knew when she was at the top
of the pyramid.

00:15:22.988 --> 00:15:25.758 line:95%,end
And this is where
it's bad parenting, Kelly.

00:15:25.824 --> 00:15:29.094 line:95%,end
She should have opened her mouth
and said, Abby, let somebody else

00:15:29.161 --> 00:15:31.096 line:95%,end
be at the top of the pyramid this week.

00:15:31.163 --> 00:15:33.766 line:95%,end
That Is a mature 13-year-old.

00:15:33.832 --> 00:15:36.936 line:95%,end
Not screwing everybody
and stabbing them in the back.

00:15:37.002 --> 00:15:38.971 line:95%,end
But I don't think
she's screwing any of them.

00:15:39.038 --> 00:15:41.774 line:95%,end
She's screwing me.
I can feel it.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.009 line:95%,end
Uh-oh.
Okay now she's going at it.

00:15:44.076 --> 00:15:45.110 line:95%,end
Oh, she's pissed.

00:15:45.177 --> 00:15:47.313 line:95%,end
ABBY: You're gonna do your solo.
And you're going to do a solo.

00:15:47.379 --> 00:15:49.415 line:95%,end
You're staying home,
staying home, staying home.

00:15:49.481 --> 00:15:50.749 line:95%,end
That's it.

00:15:50.816 --> 00:15:52.484 line:95%,end
You're dismissed.
You're dismissed.

00:15:52.551 --> 00:15:54.219 line:95%,end
You're dismissed.
Run the solo.

00:15:54.286 --> 00:15:56.155 line:95%,end
Run the solo.
Get the senior company in here.

00:15:56.221 --> 00:15:57.456 line:95%,end
Let's go.
Thank you, Kelly.

00:15:58.457 --> 00:16:00.826 line:95%,end
So in true Abby spirit,
she has decided

00:16:00.893 --> 00:16:04.663 line:95%,end
to handle the situation
by eliminating the group number

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:05.798 line:95%,end
as a whole.

00:16:05.864 --> 00:16:07.533 line:95%,end
-Can we talk to you for a moment?
-Certainly.

00:16:07.599 --> 00:16:09.368 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Okay, Thank you Abby.

00:16:09.435 --> 00:16:11.503 line:95%,end
Well, we just wanted to clarify
because we noticed

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:14.139 line:95%,end
-that Kendall, Nia, and Paige were...
-ABBY: Dismissed.

00:16:14.206 --> 00:16:17.142 line:95%,end
They are dismissed.
You will not be traveling this weekend.

00:16:17.209 --> 00:16:20.012 line:95%,end
Well, Melissa and I
aren't going for a solo.

00:16:20.079 --> 00:16:23.615 line:95%,end
ABBY: I do not want to go back
to a competition that we won,

00:16:23.682 --> 00:16:26.051 line:95%,end
the Nationals,
without my best foot forward.

00:16:26.118 --> 00:16:29.855 line:95%,end
We're trying to stand behind
Brooke in her decision and we...

00:16:29.922 --> 00:16:31.824 line:95%,end
Well, I think you're an (bleep)

00:16:33.726 --> 00:16:34.560 line:95%,end
You're an ass.

00:16:34.626 --> 00:16:35.761 line:95%,end
Why would you stand behind
Brooke in her decision?

00:16:35.828 --> 00:16:37.029 line:95%,end
Because--because...

00:16:37.096 --> 00:16:38.464 line:95%,end
You're teaching a kid to break a contract.

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:40.432 line:95%,end
-No.
-Yes, you are.

00:16:40.499 --> 00:16:43.135 line:95%,end
No, we're teaching our kids
that you support your friends.

00:16:43.202 --> 00:16:45.971 line:95%,end
Well, when your kid
gets a full scholarship to Harvard

00:16:46.038 --> 00:16:48.240 line:95%,end
and Brooke's going to community college
like her mother,

00:16:48.307 --> 00:16:50.376 line:95%,end
go with her and support your friends.

00:16:50.442 --> 00:16:51.844 line:95%,end
<i>Christi opens her mouth.</i>

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:54.580 line:95%,end
Oh, well, we support her decision.

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:57.783 line:95%,end
Yeah, because you want your kid
to get the lead, Christi.

00:16:57.850 --> 00:16:59.818 line:95%,end
We know!
We know how you work.

00:16:59.885 --> 00:17:03.088 line:95%,end
-That feels ridiculous.
-We're saying we're a team.

00:17:03.155 --> 00:17:05.290 line:95%,end
Well, you can go be a team
at another dance studio,

00:17:05.357 --> 00:17:08.827 line:95%,end
because at this studio,
it's my way or the highway.

Well, you can go be a team
in another dance studio,

it's my way or the highway.

That's it.

00:17:23.709 --> 00:17:24.777 line:95%,end
I've made up my mind.

00:17:24.843 --> 00:17:27.679 line:5%,start
If we can't walk in there
national champions

00:17:27.746 --> 00:17:30.449 line:5%,start
with a number that I know can win,

00:17:30.516 --> 00:17:31.750 line:95%,end
<i>then I don't want to go.</i>

00:17:31.817 --> 00:17:33.052 line:95%,end
So, we are the National winners.

00:17:33.118 --> 00:17:34.553 line:95%,end
I don't want to tarnish that reputation.

00:17:35.187 --> 00:17:37.156 line:95%,end
Maddie is their national title winner.

00:17:37.222 --> 00:17:38.991 line:95%,end
I don't want her to look bad.

00:17:39.058 --> 00:17:40.659 line:95%,end
And Gianna is going to go.

00:17:40.726 --> 00:17:42.027 line:95%,end
My name will not be on the number.

00:17:42.494 --> 00:17:44.229 line:95%,end
HOLLY:
<i>So first it was, the group was not going.</i>

00:17:44.296 --> 00:17:47.066 line:5%,start
Now the group is going,
but the group can only go

00:17:47.132 --> 00:17:49.101 line:95%,end
<i>if her name is removed</i>

00:17:49.168 --> 00:17:50.969 line:95%,end
<i>and she's not doing any choreography.</i>

00:17:51.036 --> 00:17:53.305 line:95%,end
And that's the ultimate slap
in the face for the girls.

00:17:53.372 --> 00:17:55.307 line:95%,end
Gianna is willing to
come in tomorrow morning...

00:17:56.041 --> 00:17:58.610 line:95%,end
and rehearse for four hours
before you get on the bus.

00:17:58.677 --> 00:18:00.279 line:95%,end
The mothers have made it quite clear

00:18:00.345 --> 00:18:02.114 line:95%,end
that they think that their kids
are amazing

00:18:02.181 --> 00:18:03.549 line:5%,start

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:08.420 line:95%,end
<i>and come here and work on</i>
<i>this number, that's fine.</i>

00:18:08.487 --> 00:18:13.025 line:95%,end
Because I cannot let Brooke
hold back these other dancers.

00:18:13.092 --> 00:18:17.830 line:95%,end
I would never let my child
shake her pompoms for some boy

to go to college for free.

00:18:19.798 --> 00:18:21.867 line:95%,end
I know that, Abby,
and I need her to make that decision

00:18:21.934 --> 00:18:22.768 line:95%,end
on her own.

ABBY: You make a commitment
in the beginning of the year,

00:18:24.503 --> 00:18:26.105 line:95%,end
you see it through
til the end of the year.

00:18:26.171 --> 00:18:28.974 line:95%,end
If you don't want to do it
again next year, that's fine.

00:18:29.041 --> 00:18:30.809 line:95%,end
There's integrity there.

<i>Brooke should have come and told me.</i>

00:18:32.911 --> 00:18:34.113 line:95%,end
Would I have been angry?

00:18:34.179 --> 00:18:37.616 line:95%,end
Yes, but it would have
been the right move

00:18:37.683 --> 00:18:40.119 line:95%,end
on her part and her parents.

00:18:40.185 --> 00:18:41.120 line:95%,end
Enough said.

Okay. Sounds good.

Okay. Bye!

that Brooke is not in this number,

with that.

you know the Candy Apples,
they're coming for blood.

00:21:35.627 --> 00:21:36.662 line:95%,end
They want to beat us.

00:21:36.728 --> 00:21:38.563 line:95%,end
And this may be an opportunity for them

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:41.500 line:95%,end

getting on the bus.

I'm telling you one thing.

That Candy Appple lady,
I don't care what she does.

00:21:48.607 --> 00:21:50.175 line:95%,end
She better not beat you.

00:21:50.242 --> 00:21:52.044 line:95%,end
Because you think I'm mad
at Brooke now, just wait.

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:53.412 line:95%,end
If that woman wins,

00:21:53.478 --> 00:21:56.748 line:95%,end
Brooke's hide'll be hanging off the top
of that balcony at that studio.

that back handspring, too.

I wasn't going to come

Not only do you have
to prove Brooke wrong,
