ABBY: <i>Previously on</i> Dance Moms...

00:00:02.335 --> 00:00:04.037 line:5%,start
Please welcome Peyton.

(cheering)

00:00:05.772 --> 00:00:09.476 line:5%,start
And the trio is going to be
Chloe, Maddie, and Kendall.

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:11.678 line:5%,start
JILL: I don't think
she's replacing Peyton.

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:12.645 line:5%,start
She just did.

00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.214 line:5%,start
ABBY: Getting on top of that pyramid
is one thing.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.882 line:5%,start
Staying there's another.

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.852 line:5%,start
<i>If you're in that age category,</i>
<i>I want you to win that age category.</i>

00:00:18.918 --> 00:00:21.054 line:5%,start
I thought that I was better
than the most of the people for--

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:22.422 line:5%,start
ABBY: You thought
you were better than most

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:23.790 line:5%,start
of the people in this group?

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:24.791 line:5%,start
Oh, that's cocky.

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:25.759 line:5%,start
You're gonna kick her off to the curb?

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:28.261 line:5%,start
She came in here,
had this snotty little attitude,

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:29.963 line:5%,start
and you back her up.

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:32.332 line:5%,start
<i>Coming up on </i>Dance Moms...

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.267 line:5%,start
I was wondering
if I could come back to dance.

00:00:34.334 --> 00:00:35.735 line:5%,start
It's just not that easy.

00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:36.736 line:5%,start
I don't want small parts.

00:00:36.803 --> 00:00:38.671 line:5%,start
I want big parts for my kid.
We're off probation.

00:00:38.738 --> 00:00:40.473 line:5%,start
Oh, get in line, girlfriend.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.374 line:5%,start
Get in line.

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:42.942 line:5%,start
JILL: When can Kendall have a solo?

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:44.144 line:5%,start
When can Kendall be more?

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.879 line:5%,start
You need to tell your mother
to knock it off.

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:47.447 line:5%,start
She's going to get you in trouble.

00:00:47.514 --> 00:00:49.849 line:5%,start
This is about Chloe always being second.

00:00:49.916 --> 00:00:51.684 line:5%,start
Chloe is not second.

00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:53.553 line:5%,start
You better not say that again.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.988 line:5%,start
I cannot stand this bickering.

00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.393 line:5%,start
I will do that.

Cheerleading just wasn't my thing.

Abby was really upset.

00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:29.289 line:95%,end
I don't know
if she's going to take me back.

00:01:29.355 --> 00:01:30.390 line:95%,end
But I hope she does.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:31.791 line:95%,end
So.

00:01:31.858 --> 00:01:32.725 line:95%,end
Um...

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.029 line:95%,end
I tried cheerleading.

00:01:37.363 --> 00:01:40.233 line:95%,end
And I was wondering
if I could come back to dance.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.635 line:95%,end
It's just not that easy, Brooke.

00:01:42.702 --> 00:01:44.070 line:95%,end
You stab everybody in the back.

00:01:44.137 --> 00:01:45.171 line:95%,end
You slap me in the face.

00:01:45.538 --> 00:01:47.006 line:95%,end
She should have opened her mouth and said,

00:01:47.073 --> 00:01:48.875 line:95%,end
let somebody else be
at the top of the pyramid.

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:50.610 line:95%,end
She's screwing me.
I can feel it.

00:01:50.977 --> 00:01:54.681 line:95%,end
I just wanted to try it out
to make sure dance is what I wanted to do.

00:01:54.747 --> 00:01:57.617 line:95%,end
What my problem with that
was that you didn't speak up

00:01:57.684 --> 00:02:00.520 line:95%,end
and say something ahead of time.

00:02:00.587 --> 00:02:02.021 line:95%,end
And I mean, you
just didn't show up.

00:02:02.822 --> 00:02:04.190 line:95%,end
You let a lot of people down.

00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:07.460 line:95%,end
You let me down.

00:02:07.527 --> 00:02:09.362 line:95%,end
<i>I'm very torn about this decision.</i>

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:10.997 line:95%,end
<i>She let the team down.</i>

00:02:11.064 --> 00:02:11.931 line:95%,end
<i>She has lost trust.</i>

00:02:11.998 --> 00:02:13.867 line:95%,end
<i>And Brooke broke my heart.</i>

00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:15.535 line:95%,end
My biggest disappointment I think, too,

00:02:15.602 --> 00:02:18.238 line:95%,end
would be that you just
didn't want to dance.

00:02:19.672 --> 00:02:21.741 line:95%,end
You have a God-given talent.

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:23.376 line:95%,end
Don't throw it away, honey.

00:02:23.443 --> 00:02:24.844 line:95%,end
<i>Brooke was born to dance.</i>

00:02:24.911 --> 00:02:29.816 line:5%,start
And I have invested my time
and my energy into this kid.

00:02:29.883 --> 00:02:35.522 line:95%,end
For it to go unnoticed and just disappear,
I'm not going to let that happen.

00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:37.957 line:95%,end
I think you have a lot
to offer to the team.

00:02:38.024 --> 00:02:39.993 line:95%,end
You're going to have
to really prove yourself.

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:42.428 line:95%,end

Moms, in here.

00:02:56.442 --> 00:02:59.512 line:95%,end
At this time, I would like
to officially welcome Kendall.

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.915 line:95%,end
You're a member
of the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:03:01.981 --> 00:03:02.815 line:95%,end
Here you go.

It's not a matter of
here's your jacket, kid,

you're in for the rest of your life.

00:03:14.961 --> 00:03:15.795 line:95%,end
No way.

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:17.597 line:95%,end
Now, listen to me.

00:03:17.664 --> 00:03:20.200 line:95%,end
This doesn't mean
it's smooth sailing from here on out.

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:22.302 line:95%,end
It means you really have to work hard.

00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:25.104 line:95%,end
LESLIE: <i>I'm not worried that Kendall</i>
<i>is off probation</i>

00:03:25.171 --> 00:03:29.409 line:5%,start
because I'm just very confident in Peyton,
that she's going to really pull through

00:03:29.475 --> 00:03:32.612 line:95%,end
and she's going to show Abby
that she's a good dancer

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:33.846 line:95%,end
and that she's a great performer.


00:03:33.913 --> 00:03:35.315 line:95%,end
ABBY: When you're wearing that jacket,

00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:37.483 line:95%,end
she can't be all hunched over
and slouching.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.520 line:95%,end
So if you see that, Mom,
you take a thumbtack

00:03:40.587 --> 00:03:42.255 line:95%,end
and you stick it
right between her shoulder blades.

00:03:42.322 --> 00:03:44.624 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>Apparently the greatest thing</i>
<i>that's ever happened in Jill's life</i>

00:03:44.691 --> 00:03:46.226 line:5%,start
is that Kendall is off probation

00:03:46.292 --> 00:03:48.528 line:5%,start
because she was just grins
from ear-to-ear.

00:03:48.595 --> 00:03:50.063 line:95%,end
She was like the Cheshire cat.

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:55.034 line:95%,end
We are going to Starbound Competition
in Long Island, New York.

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:58.605 line:95%,end
And I'll tell you what,
they are ready for us.

00:03:58.671 --> 00:04:00.873 line:95%,end
They want to beat
the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.076 line:95%,end
And they are serious.

00:04:03.142 --> 00:04:04.777 line:95%,end
They're like sharks in the water.

00:04:04.844 --> 00:04:06.379 line:95%,end
They can taste the blood.

00:04:06.446 --> 00:04:09.282 line:5%,start
MACKENZIE: I'm not nervous
because I know I can be as good as them.

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:10.316 line:5%,start
All right, now...

00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:14.721 line:5%,start
Mackenzie, you did well
with your solo the last time.

00:04:14.787 --> 00:04:16.522 line:95%,end
You need to do even better this time.

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:20.193 line:95%,end
Nia, chosen for a special part.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.694 line:95%,end
Your mom didn't want you to do it.

00:04:22.295 --> 00:04:24.030 line:95%,end
Not a lot to say.

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:25.832 line:95%,end
Next, Paige.

00:04:25.898 --> 00:04:28.167 line:95%,end
You didn't do a solo.
You didn't do a duet or trio.

00:04:28.234 --> 00:04:29.802 line:95%,end
So there wasn't a lot to judge you on.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.606 line:95%,end
Kendall, you're off probation.

00:04:34.007 --> 00:04:35.475 line:95%,end
You're a member of the team.

00:04:35.541 --> 00:04:38.278 line:95%,end
However, we need to fix the feet,

00:04:38.344 --> 00:04:39.846 line:95%,end
the turn out, the back of the knees.

00:04:40.346 --> 00:04:42.348 line:95%,end
You still have a lot of work
ahead of you, honey.

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:45.018 line:95%,end
Moving on, Maddie.

00:04:45.985 --> 00:04:48.621 line:95%,end
Did a great job, won your category,

00:04:49.255 --> 00:04:50.556 line:95%,end
won the overall high score.

00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:52.892 line:95%,end
But I have to keep challenging you.

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:55.895 line:95%,end
<i>I know Maddie is a little disappointed</i>
<i>with her spot on the pyramid.</i>

00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:57.730 line:95%,end
<i>But I have to keep my thumb on that kid.</i>

00:04:57.797 --> 00:04:59.299 line:95%,end
She needs to work harder

00:04:59.365 --> 00:05:01.801 line:95%,end
because it's not always
going to be this easy.

00:05:01.868 --> 00:05:04.971 line:95%,end
And next, I have Chloe.

00:05:05.038 --> 00:05:07.740 line:95%,end
(tense music playing)

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:09.042 line:95%,end
ABBY: We're going to give them
what they want.

00:05:09.942 --> 00:05:13.212 line:5%,start
KELLY: When Abby revealed
the center row of the pyramid

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:16.983 line:5%,start
and it was Chloe and Maddie,
I was shocked.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.386 line:95%,end
I didn't think Peyton
performed well enough to be

00:05:20.453 --> 00:05:21.888 line:95%,end
at the top of the pyramid.

00:05:21.954 --> 00:05:25.191 line:95%,end
Chloe, when you walk backstage
into those wings,

00:05:25.258 --> 00:05:26.793 line:95%,end
you have to walk in there with arrogance

00:05:26.859 --> 00:05:27.860 line:95%,end
and your nose up in the air

00:05:27.927 --> 00:05:29.962 line:95%,end
just like you walk in this studio
every day.

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:31.698 line:95%,end
Those other girls should be afraid of you

00:05:31.764 --> 00:05:33.399 line:95%,end
just because you're Chloe

00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:35.335 line:95%,end
and you're from
the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:05:35.401 --> 00:05:38.071 line:95%,end
And on top of the pyramid...

00:05:38.137 --> 00:05:39.772 line:95%,end
(tense music playing)

00:05:41.307 --> 00:05:42.175 line:95%,end

CHRISTI: Abby unveils
the top of the pyramid,

00:05:50.883 --> 00:05:52.652 line:95%,end
and I thought,
you get them, sister,

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:55.188 line:95%,end
because you left, and you went,
and you tried out for cheerleading,

00:05:55.254 --> 00:05:57.323 line:95%,end

to the top of the pyramid.

JILL: <i>No offense to Peyton.</i>

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:05.298 line:95%,end
<i>But she towers over this dance team.</i>

00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:07.367 line:5%,start
She doesn't fit in with these girls.

00:06:07.433 --> 00:06:10.570 line:5%,start
Now, my little Kendall
fits right in perfectly.

00:06:10.636 --> 00:06:12.205 line:95%,end
ABBY: I know you all are wondering

00:06:12.271 --> 00:06:14.006 line:95%,end
how could she be on top of the pyramid.

00:06:14.073 --> 00:06:16.743 line:95%,end
Not only is she going to do
a solo this week

00:06:17.477 --> 00:06:21.047 line:95%,end
and not only should she win,
I demand that you win.

00:06:22.515 --> 00:06:24.884 line:95%,end
Peyton, we all know
everyone is replaceable.

00:06:24.951 --> 00:06:28.621 line:95%,end
You were not the right replacement
for this group.

00:06:29.555 --> 00:06:31.190 line:95%,end
You had a great experience.

00:06:31.257 --> 00:06:33.393 line:95%,end
You saw the gateway to the West.

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:34.894 line:95%,end
You cannot be upset.

00:06:34.961 --> 00:06:37.397 line:95%,end
She has a right to be upset, Abby.

00:06:37.463 --> 00:06:39.065 line:95%,end
You dangled a carrot in front of her.

00:06:39.132 --> 00:06:40.767 line:95%,end
And you just ripped it away.

00:06:40.833 --> 00:06:41.801 line:95%,end
For what?

00:06:41.868 --> 00:06:45.671 line:95%,end
For her daughter to just come in
and take a spot as a stranger.

00:06:45.738 --> 00:06:48.307 line:95%,end
And for Brooke to leave,
and you take her back.

00:06:48.374 --> 00:06:49.642 line:95%,end
Where is your loyalty?

00:06:49.709 --> 00:06:51.544 line:95%,end
We have been so loyal to you.

00:06:51.611 --> 00:06:52.445 line:95%,end
-Loyalty?
-Wait a minute.

00:06:52.512 --> 00:06:53.746 line:95%,end
Wait a minute.

00:06:53.813 --> 00:06:54.981 line:95%,end
Yes, loyalty, Kelly.

00:06:55.047 --> 00:06:56.449 line:95%,end
We have been loyal to her
for 30 something years.

00:06:56.516 --> 00:06:57.350 line:95%,end
WOMAN: Leslie, we've been over this.

00:06:57.417 --> 00:06:58.518 line:95%,end
She left for one week.

00:06:58.584 --> 00:07:00.453 line:95%,end
She said she doesn't want to dance.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.288 line:95%,end
You left the studio a long time ago.

00:07:02.355 --> 00:07:03.756 line:95%,end
How dare you!
Our history--

00:07:03.823 --> 00:07:04.957 line:95%,end
Don't how dare me.

00:07:05.024 --> 00:07:06.626 line:95%,end
Peyton got to go St. Louis.

00:07:06.692 --> 00:07:08.227 line:95%,end
She got to be in the competition.


00:07:08.294 --> 00:07:09.562 line:95%,end
<i>Peyton was on probation.</i>

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:11.531 line:95%,end
If you can't say anything nice,
don't say anything at all.

00:07:11.597 --> 00:07:13.833 line:95%,end
So you are still on probation.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.769 line:95%,end
It was not about
being on the team forever.

00:07:16.836 --> 00:07:19.138 line:95%,end
Somehow, her mother got that
all twisted in her mind.

00:07:19.205 --> 00:07:20.072 line:95%,end
You know what, Abby?

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:21.541 line:95%,end
If you don't want her,

00:07:21.607 --> 00:07:24.610 line:95%,end
we will find somebody that wants her
to compete on their team.

00:07:24.677 --> 00:07:25.511 line:95%,end
Peyton, let's go.

00:07:25.578 --> 00:07:26.779 line:95%,end
You can keep your Kendall.

00:07:26.846 --> 00:07:28.481 line:95%,end
And you can keep the rest of your group.

00:07:28.548 --> 00:07:30.349 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>Sometimes, you get it.</i>
<i>Sometimes, you don't.</i>

00:07:30.416 --> 00:07:31.517 line:95%,end
End of story.

00:07:33.019 --> 00:07:35.521 line:95%,end
Brooke, you have the solo
that you must win.

00:07:35.588 --> 00:07:37.857 line:95%,end
Mackenzie, you have a solo.

00:07:37.924 --> 00:07:40.293 line:95%,end
The group number, high energy.

00:07:40.359 --> 00:07:42.595 line:95%,end
Everybody, join us.
Everybody on your feet.

00:07:42.662 --> 00:07:43.596 line:95%,end
Everybody dancing.

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:46.265 line:95%,end
WOMAN: You have to be in this window.
Do it again.

00:07:46.332 --> 00:07:47.633 line:5%,start
I want to see perfect jetes.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.769 line:5%,start
Walk, walk, jete.

00:07:49.836 --> 00:07:51.170 line:5%,start
Duh, duh, duh.

00:07:51.237 --> 00:07:52.271 line:5%,start
Up.

00:07:52.338 --> 00:07:56.075 line:5%,start
ABBY: <i>This week's group number</i>
<i>is called Avalanche.</i>

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:58.644 line:95%,end
You know, let's just say
it's about the whole world

00:07:58.711 --> 00:08:00.546 line:95%,end
of cheerleading tumbling down.

00:08:00.613 --> 00:08:02.381 line:95%,end
Go one, two, three.

00:08:02.448 --> 00:08:04.383 line:95%,end
You're at four, five.

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:06.185 line:95%,end
JILL: And I can't believe Leslie thought
Peyton was going to be at the top.

00:08:06.252 --> 00:08:08.554 line:95%,end
-WOMAN: How about--
-WOMAN: I felt bad for Peyton.

00:08:08.621 --> 00:08:10.990 line:95%,end
JILL: Are you kidding me?
Why would you feel bad for her?

00:08:11.057 --> 00:08:13.392 line:95%,end
-Because she's a kid.
-WOMAN: They got a great opportunity.

00:08:13.459 --> 00:08:14.560 line:95%,end
She's not a baby.

00:08:14.627 --> 00:08:15.761 line:95%,end
Listen, my kid was in there.

00:08:15.828 --> 00:08:16.762 line:95%,end
She's eight years old.

00:08:16.829 --> 00:08:18.865 line:95%,end
She was on probation.

00:08:18.931 --> 00:08:20.333 line:95%,end
She had to earn her spot.

00:08:20.399 --> 00:08:23.536 line:95%,end
Apparently,
when Jill got off of probation,

00:08:23.603 --> 00:08:25.972 line:95%,end
it was really her mouth
that got off of probation.

00:08:26.038 --> 00:08:28.074 line:95%,end
KELLY: I am so happy that Brooke is back.

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:29.609 line:95%,end
I am, too.

00:08:29.675 --> 00:08:30.910 line:95%,end
-That poor girl.
-Yeah, how about that?

00:08:30.977 --> 00:08:32.845 line:95%,end
And she has to win, or she's done.

00:08:32.912 --> 00:08:33.746 line:95%,end
I know.

00:08:33.813 --> 00:08:36.182 line:95%,end
I think Abby is being
very tough on Brooke.

00:08:36.249 --> 00:08:37.683 line:95%,end
I mean, she puts her
to the top of the pyramid

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:40.119 line:95%,end
and says that she has to win.

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:41.754 line:95%,end
<i>Brooke hasn't danced in two weeks.</i>

00:08:41.821 --> 00:08:44.090 line:95%,end
<i>She has four days to learn her dance.</i>

00:08:44.156 --> 00:08:46.993 line:95%,end
I mean, how much more pressure
can you put on the kid?

00:08:47.059 --> 00:08:48.461 line:95%,end
There is no way Brooke--

00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:50.396 line:95%,end
sorry, should have been
on top of that pyramid.

00:08:51.564 --> 00:08:52.732 line:95%,end
There is no way.

00:08:52.798 --> 00:08:54.000 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: You just want to be
at the top, Jill.

00:08:54.066 --> 00:08:56.002 line:95%,end
Now that Kendall is off probation,

00:08:56.068 --> 00:08:58.237 line:95%,end
<i>I'm not going to hold back</i>
<i>my thoughts anymore.</i>

00:08:58.304 --> 00:09:00.072 line:95%,end
Personally, I think Maddie
should have been on top

00:09:00.139 --> 00:09:01.374 line:95%,end
because she won.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:04.010 line:95%,end
Maddie also won
because Abby spent all of her time

00:09:04.076 --> 00:09:05.077 line:95%,end
rehearsing her number.

00:09:05.144 --> 00:09:06.345 line:95%,end
She didn't rehearse the group number.

00:09:06.412 --> 00:09:07.446 line:95%,end
She didn't rehearse the trio.

00:09:07.513 --> 00:09:09.448 line:95%,end
The only thing she cared about
was Maddie's solo.

00:09:09.515 --> 00:09:10.716 line:95%,end
Sorry, Melissa, it's the truth.

00:09:10.783 --> 00:09:12.084 line:95%,end
I'm calling a spade a spade.

00:09:12.151 --> 00:09:14.053 line:95%,end
KELLY: I have to say
that I'm glad the trio didn't win.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.288 line:95%,end
She's got a point.

00:09:15.354 --> 00:09:16.589 line:95%,end
I knew that was coming.

00:09:16.656 --> 00:09:19.692 line:95%,end
I have to say,
I'm very happy that that trio didn't win.

00:09:20.426 --> 00:09:22.328 line:95%,end
JILL: <i>The trio really</i>
<i>didn't work well together.</i>

00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:24.430 line:95%,end
<i>And if they had just one more week,</i>

00:09:24.497 --> 00:09:26.432 line:95%,end
<i>I guarantee it would win</i>
<i>the next time out.</i>

00:09:26.499 --> 00:09:28.968 line:95%,end
<i>Kendall can do everything</i>
<i>that those girls are doing.</i>

00:09:29.035 --> 00:09:32.538 line:95%,end
I'm disappointed that Kendall
does not have a special part.

00:09:32.605 --> 00:09:33.773 line:95%,end
Go.

00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:36.042 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:09:36.108 --> 00:09:38.144 line:95%,end
WOMAN: Maddie, you do it wrong.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:39.478 line:95%,end
There's a hierarchy.

00:09:39.545 --> 00:09:40.980 line:95%,end
There's a top of the pyramid.

00:09:41.047 --> 00:09:42.081 line:95%,end
There's a bottom.

00:09:42.148 --> 00:09:44.717 line:95%,end
There are different levels of dancers.

00:09:44.784 --> 00:09:46.185 line:95%,end
-Oh, yeah.
-You know that.

00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:47.687 line:95%,end
-Yeah, well, look at Mackenzie.
-JILL: Holly, you know that.

00:09:47.753 --> 00:09:49.622 line:95%,end
If you're trying to get me
to say that my child is weak,

00:09:49.689 --> 00:09:51.157 line:95%,end
I'm not going to say that.

00:09:51.223 --> 00:09:56.062 line:5%,start
Jill has a tendency to say snide remarks
about certain student.

00:09:56.128 --> 00:09:57.063 line:95%,end
Usually, it's Nia.

00:09:57.129 --> 00:10:00.900 line:95%,end
<i>It is very evident to me that she sees Nia</i>
<i>as a--as the weak link,</i>

00:10:00.967 --> 00:10:03.102 line:95%,end
<i>that she does not think</i>
<i>she's a particularly strong dancer.</i>

00:10:03.769 --> 00:10:06.205 line:95%,end
<i>And I don't care what Jill says.</i>

00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:07.540 line:95%,end
It doesn't matter what you say up here.

00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:09.442 line:95%,end
What matters is what happens on stage.

00:10:09.508 --> 00:10:11.010 line:95%,end
Absolutely, I agree with you 100%.

00:10:11.077 --> 00:10:12.445 line:95%,end
Put your money where your mouth is.

00:10:12.511 --> 00:10:14.046 line:95%,end
I have no problem with that.

00:10:14.113 --> 00:10:15.915 line:95%,end
KELLY: Oh, put your money
where your mouth is, what's that mean?

00:10:15.982 --> 00:10:17.617 line:95%,end
You're going to buy her a big present?

00:10:17.683 --> 00:10:19.051 line:95%,end
JILL: No, this isn't about presents.

00:10:19.118 --> 00:10:21.087 line:95%,end
I think what she meant is--

00:10:21.153 --> 00:10:22.021 line:95%,end
Bring it.

00:10:22.088 --> 00:10:23.122 line:95%,end
I meant bring it.

00:10:23.189 --> 00:10:24.023 line:95%,end
Kendall can do--

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:25.591 line:95%,end
Bring it.

00:10:25.658 --> 00:10:27.927 line:95%,end
-Bring your present on.

00:10:27.994 --> 00:10:29.729 line:95%,end
-My kid will get there on her own.
-JILL: She will bring it.

I think the real Jill is coming out.

00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:35.234 line:95%,end

we all better watch out.

00:12:16.168 --> 00:12:17.369 line:95%,end
You've come a long way.

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:20.906 line:95%,end
You just learned a dance in 30 minutes.

00:12:20.973 --> 00:12:22.808 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:12:22.875 --> 00:12:24.276 line:95%,end
ABBY: Leg out and kneel up.

00:12:24.343 --> 00:12:27.513 line:5%,start
One, two, three, four.

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:32.518 line:5%,start
This week's group routine
started out as kind of a play

00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:33.819 line:95%,end
on cheerleading.

00:12:33.886 --> 00:12:36.188 line:95%,end
<i>It's fun. It's artistic. It's hot.</i>

00:12:36.255 --> 00:12:37.623 line:95%,end
Walk, strut, strut.

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:39.792 line:95%,end
Walk, walk, strut, strut.

00:12:39.859 --> 00:12:42.695 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>In the group number this week,</i>
<i>Paige has a special part.</i>

00:12:42.762 --> 00:12:45.064 line:5%,start
She's the only one on stage
when the music starts.

00:12:45.131 --> 00:12:49.034 line:95%,end
<i>And Paige is just totally thrilled</i>
<i>to have a special part.</i>

00:12:49.101 --> 00:12:50.836 line:95%,end
JILL: Did Kendall do her solo yet?

00:12:50.903 --> 00:12:52.671 line:95%,end
It's not big.
It's like a small part.

00:12:52.738 --> 00:12:55.541 line:95%,end
JILL: Well, I don't want small parts.
I want big parts for my kid.

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:57.777 line:95%,end
-We're off probation.
-Oh, get in line, girlfriend.

00:12:57.843 --> 00:12:59.278 line:95%,end
Get in line.

00:12:59.345 --> 00:13:02.414 line:95%,end
Jill was complaining
because Paige had a special part

00:13:02.481 --> 00:13:04.016 line:95%,end
and Kendall didn't.

00:13:04.083 --> 00:13:07.086 line:95%,end
Wait in line because my daughter
never has a special part.

00:13:07.153 --> 00:13:09.088 line:95%,end
You've got to work your way up
from a background dancer.

00:13:09.155 --> 00:13:10.055 line:95%,end
JILL: I thought--

00:13:10.122 --> 00:13:11.023 line:95%,end
I thought I did.

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:11.924 line:95%,end
Are you kidding me?

00:13:11.991 --> 00:13:14.393 line:95%,end
That's all I have to look forward to
is watching my kid in the back...

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:15.494 line:95%,end
(overlapping chatter)

00:13:15.561 --> 00:13:18.164 line:95%,end
...while Maddie and Chloe
are in the front doing their thing.

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:20.499 line:95%,end
<i>Kendall can do everything</i>
<i>that those girls are doing.</i>

00:13:20.566 --> 00:13:22.935 line:5%,start
And I think they're thinking,
well, if Kendall gets it,

00:13:23.002 --> 00:13:24.904 line:5%,start
then that means one of their kids won't.

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:26.539 line:95%,end
And it's starting to bother me.

00:13:26.605 --> 00:13:28.240 line:95%,end
WOMAN: You've had more than one solo.

00:13:28.307 --> 00:13:29.975 line:95%,end
-WOMAN: Abby always says this--
-WOMAN: And you've had a trio.

00:13:30.042 --> 00:13:33.913 line:95%,end
Every kid should have something special
to feel good about.

00:13:33.979 --> 00:13:35.915 line:95%,end
Well, I think that we should just
not watch anymore

00:13:35.981 --> 00:13:38.117 line:95%,end
because it's really annoying
listening to everybody bitch.

00:13:38.184 --> 00:13:40.219 line:95%,end
You know what?
That's my--that my joy.

00:13:40.286 --> 00:13:41.921 line:95%,end
-I know you like it.
-This is my hobby, watching my kids.

00:13:41.987 --> 00:13:43.422 line:95%,end
-I know. I don't like to watch.
-JILL: It's what I do.

00:13:43.489 --> 00:13:45.191 line:95%,end
I would never not want to watch.

00:13:45.758 --> 00:13:46.692 line:95%,end
I'd rather be shopping.

00:13:46.759 --> 00:13:47.626 line:95%,end
I definitely like Jill.

00:13:47.693 --> 00:13:50.563 line:5%,start
I don't want her to be a doormat
as everyone says I am.

00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:53.165 line:5%,start
So I'm glad that she's speaking her mind.

00:13:54.033 --> 00:13:56.735 line:95%,end
JILL: I've got to secure a place
for Kendall.

00:13:56.802 --> 00:14:00.005 line:95%,end
I can't stand to watch her in the back
again and again and again.

00:14:00.072 --> 00:14:01.907 line:95%,end
Kendall is off probation.

00:14:01.974 --> 00:14:04.376 line:95%,end
I'm ready to fight
for what my child deserves.

00:14:04.443 --> 00:14:07.246 line:95%,end
Your backs have to be even
on the floor, right?

00:14:07.313 --> 00:14:08.981 line:95%,end
Like, as much weight on top--

00:14:09.048 --> 00:14:10.182 line:95%,end
-JILL: Do you have a minute?
-WOMAN: Uh-huh.

00:14:10.249 --> 00:14:11.984 line:95%,end
-Is the group done?
-Yes, the group's finished.

00:14:12.051 --> 00:14:13.953 line:95%,end
JILL: Chloe has a special part.

00:14:14.019 --> 00:14:15.321 line:95%,end
Maddie has a special part.

00:14:15.387 --> 00:14:17.456 line:95%,end
Paige has a special part.

00:14:17.523 --> 00:14:19.959 line:95%,end
Can I ask why Kendall
doesn't have anything?

00:14:20.025 --> 00:14:21.594 line:95%,end
I thought she was taken off probation.

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:23.062 line:95%,end
I just did every other person.

00:14:23.596 --> 00:14:26.098 line:95%,end
JILL: I would really appreciate
if you could--something--

00:14:26.165 --> 00:14:28.567 line:95%,end
Maybe not tonight, but I know
we have rehearsal again tomorrow.

00:14:28.634 --> 00:14:31.103 line:95%,end
See what you can do.
I know you're busy.

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:32.638 line:95%,end
Okay, thank you.

00:14:34.139 --> 00:14:35.674 line:95%,end
ABBY: What was that mother saying to you?

00:14:35.741 --> 00:14:39.111 line:95%,end
Asked me why Kendall didn't have
a special part in the dance this week.

00:14:39.178 --> 00:14:40.813 line:95%,end
-She did not.
-She did.


00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.182 line:95%,end
ABBY: I hope Jill doesn't
become a problem.

00:14:43.249 --> 00:14:46.085 line:95%,end
Maybe she didn't understand
that it's inappropriate

00:14:46.151 --> 00:14:47.853 line:95%,end
to question a choreographer.

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:52.157 line:95%,end
I--I really, really hope that my daughter
and her daughter

00:14:52.224 --> 00:14:54.860 line:95%,end
didn't hear you talking about them
to their teacher.

00:14:54.927 --> 00:14:56.428 line:95%,end
I wasn't talking about them.

00:14:56.495 --> 00:15:00.900 line:5%,start
Jill thinks that Kendall
is the greatest dancer since Anna Pavlova.

00:15:00.966 --> 00:15:03.802 line:95%,end
And that might have been true
in her old studio.

00:15:03.869 --> 00:15:07.072 line:95%,end
But you just walked into a studio
that has a lot of talent.

00:15:07.139 --> 00:15:10.442 line:95%,end
<i>These kids don't mess around.</i>

00:15:10.509 --> 00:15:11.977 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:15:12.978 --> 00:15:15.414 line:95%,end
WOMAN: Holly, pick a glass
and let me pour you a glass of wine.

00:15:15.481 --> 00:15:19.318 line:95%,end
KELLY:<i> I thought it was a good idea</i>
<i>to have everybody come to my house</i>

00:15:19.385 --> 00:15:23.589 line:95%,end
and have a party to welcome Brooke
back into the group.

00:15:23.656 --> 00:15:24.690 line:95%,end
Hi!

00:15:26.892 --> 00:15:28.761 line:95%,end
Well, the party is about to start.

00:15:28.827 --> 00:15:30.062 line:95%,end
JILL: Hello!

00:15:30.129 --> 00:15:32.031 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: When Jill and Melissa
walked in the door,

00:15:32.097 --> 00:15:36.735 line:95%,end
the atmosphere went from like
buh, buh, buh to wah, wah, wah.

00:15:36.802 --> 00:15:37.636 line:95%,end
Here's to the pyramid.

00:15:37.703 --> 00:15:39.071 line:95%,end
Cheers.

00:15:39.138 --> 00:15:41.373 line:95%,end
-Oh, God.
-Look, I'm the queen.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.142 line:95%,end
WOMAN: What was your conversation
with Gianna tonight?

00:15:43.208 --> 00:15:47.780 line:95%,end
I said, how come every kid in there
except Nia and Kendall

00:15:47.846 --> 00:15:48.781 line:95%,end
had a special part?

00:15:48.847 --> 00:15:52.718 line:95%,end
I just want to clarify, Jill,
that when you come in

00:15:52.785 --> 00:15:55.421 line:95%,end
and you're new,
then you obviously start at the bottom.

00:15:55.487 --> 00:15:57.056 line:95%,end
And so you need to work your way up.

00:15:57.122 --> 00:15:58.257 line:95%,end
Well, do you think I looked bad asking?

00:15:58.324 --> 00:15:59.491 line:95%,end
-HOLLY: I do.
-JILL: Really?

00:15:59.558 --> 00:16:01.827 line:95%,end
-I do.
-Asking for something that I'm paying for?

00:16:01.894 --> 00:16:04.430 line:95%,end
Asking for something
that every other kid in there had?

00:16:04.496 --> 00:16:06.031 line:95%,end
But you have any long history.

00:16:06.098 --> 00:16:07.733 line:95%,end
I wanted to get more
with your--for your child.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:10.402 line:95%,end
There's a long history there, Jill,
that you have no--

00:16:10.469 --> 00:16:12.404 line:95%,end
I don't want to have to do something nice.

00:16:12.471 --> 00:16:15.307 line:95%,end
HOLLY: <i>I think Jill's gift giving</i>
<i>is a bit ridiculous.</i>

00:16:15.374 --> 00:16:17.776 line:5%,start
Work hard the old-fashioned way.

00:16:17.843 --> 00:16:21.947 line:5%,start
Don't try to bribe your way
up the pyramid ladder.

00:16:22.014 --> 00:16:23.549 line:95%,end
JILL: Well, let me ask you this, Christi.

00:16:23.615 --> 00:16:24.883 line:95%,end
Would you do it if Abby asked you?

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:26.652 line:95%,end
-No.
-If it got you privates...

00:16:26.719 --> 00:16:28.220 line:95%,end
-No.
-...you want privates so badly.

00:16:28.287 --> 00:16:29.288 line:95%,end
No.

00:16:29.355 --> 00:16:30.556 line:95%,end
You wouldn't--you wouldn't run tuition?

00:16:30.622 --> 00:16:31.757 line:95%,end
-CHRISTI: Nope.
-Or whatever.

00:16:31.824 --> 00:16:34.259 line:95%,end
You know what?
I wouldn't because Abby has asked me to--

00:16:34.326 --> 00:16:35.594 line:95%,end
-Well, I would. I would.
-CHRISTI: Then you know what, Jill?

00:16:35.661 --> 00:16:36.862 line:95%,end
You're just like her.

00:16:36.929 --> 00:16:38.731 line:95%,end
(tense music playing)

00:16:38.797 --> 00:16:42.434 line:95%,end
KELLY:<i> I think that Jill and Melissa</i>
<i>are two peas in a pod.</i>

00:16:42.501 --> 00:16:46.171 line:95%,end
I think they both
are after the same thing.

00:16:46.238 --> 00:16:49.141 line:95%,end
They're going to kiss Abby's ass
until their daughters get ahead.

00:16:49.208 --> 00:16:52.177 line:95%,end
But it's not me. It's Abby.
You need to talk to Abby about everything.

00:16:52.244 --> 00:16:54.213 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>Melissa works</i>
<i>at the front desk for free</i>

00:16:54.279 --> 00:16:57.182 line:95%,end
<i>so that she can have free privates</i>
<i>and free dance lessons.</i>

00:16:57.249 --> 00:16:58.517 line:95%,end
She plays a certain game.

00:16:58.584 --> 00:17:00.319 line:95%,end
And we don't play that game.

00:17:00.386 --> 00:17:02.021 line:95%,end
Abby doesn't do anything, Melissa.

00:17:02.087 --> 00:17:03.088 line:95%,end
We know that.

00:17:03.155 --> 00:17:04.757 line:95%,end
She sits there and goes, Melissa, do it.

00:17:04.823 --> 00:17:05.758 line:95%,end
She's the one that's schedules it.

00:17:05.824 --> 00:17:07.359 line:95%,end
When people want a private,
I forward it to her.

00:17:07.426 --> 00:17:08.694 line:95%,end
No.

00:17:08.761 --> 00:17:11.163 line:95%,end
Melissa is Abby's friend.

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:16.301 line:95%,end
And there is the root of all the tension
among the Dance Moms.

00:17:16.368 --> 00:17:17.836 line:95%,end
I just think everyone
should be treated fairly.

00:17:17.903 --> 00:17:18.737 line:95%,end
Exactly.

00:17:18.804 --> 00:17:20.773 line:95%,end
It's blatant why your daughter
gets everything

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:24.343 line:95%,end
because you do everything in your power
to get Maddie ahead.

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:26.812 line:95%,end
-No, I don't.
-CHRISTI: Yes, you do, Melissa.

00:17:26.879 --> 00:17:28.781 line:95%,end
I don't think you should have
to defend yourself...

00:17:28.847 --> 00:17:30.649 line:95%,end
-I don't.
-...for something Abby gives your kids.

00:17:30.716 --> 00:17:33.786 line:95%,end
I don't think it's Melissa's fault
that Abby likes her kids the best.

00:17:33.852 --> 00:17:35.888 line:95%,end
Let's face it, she does.

00:17:35.954 --> 00:17:37.990 line:95%,end
So her kids get the privates.

00:17:38.057 --> 00:17:40.125 line:95%,end
You make sure that nobody else
has a chance

00:17:40.192 --> 00:17:41.527 line:95%,end
because of all the things you do.

00:17:41.593 --> 00:17:42.561 line:95%,end
Oh, please.

00:17:42.628 --> 00:17:44.663 line:95%,end
That is such (bleep).
That's why I didn't want to come.

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:46.098 line:95%,end
-So I'm leaving.
-CHRISTI: Go ahead.

00:17:46.165 --> 00:17:48.600 line:95%,end
We knew you would leave
because you deflect everything.

00:17:48.667 --> 00:17:50.803 line:95%,end
I don't argue because I'm not like you.

00:17:50.869 --> 00:17:52.304 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: No, you're not, Melissa.

00:17:52.371 --> 00:17:55.007 line:95%,end
And I'm not like you, thank God.

00:17:55.074 --> 00:17:57.709 line:95%,end
JILL: <i>I can't believe that Kelly</i>
<i>is allowing this to happen.</i>

00:17:57.776 --> 00:17:59.378 line:95%,end
Is this how you throw a party?

00:17:59.445 --> 00:18:01.213 line:95%,end
Get out.

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.414 line:95%,end
Come on, baby.

00:18:03.882 --> 00:18:07.252 line:95%,end
JILL: Why do you have to get
so personal about it?

00:18:07.319 --> 00:18:09.321 line:95%,end
And I believe that if any one of you

00:18:09.388 --> 00:18:12.291 line:95%,end
did what Melissa did
and got the privates that she gets

00:18:12.357 --> 00:18:15.394 line:95%,end
and had your child up top all the time,
you would feel the same way she does.

00:18:15.461 --> 00:18:16.895 line:95%,end
But we're not willing to do it.

00:18:16.962 --> 00:18:19.231 line:95%,end
We're not willing to sell our soul
to the devil

00:18:19.298 --> 00:18:20.966 line:95%,end
-to get the top of the pyramid.
-JILL: Then that's your decision.

00:18:21.033 --> 00:18:23.502 line:95%,end
CHRISTI:<i> Jill is really turning this group</i>
<i>upside down.</i>

00:18:23.569 --> 00:18:25.637 line:95%,end
<i>And she thinks she can come in here</i>
<i>and tell us how to be.</i>

00:18:27.239 --> 00:18:28.474 line:95%,end
You can't do that.

-Hey, new girl...
-I gotta go.

00:18:29.675 --> 00:18:31.243 line:95%,end

-I got to go.

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:34.113 line:95%,end
-Thank you, Kelly, for your hospitality.
-You're welcome.

00:18:34.179 --> 00:18:37.116 line:95%,end

MELISSA: Retail therapy
is the best therapy there is.

00:18:53.999 --> 00:18:56.268 line:5%,start
I love to shop.
And so does Jill.

00:18:56.335 --> 00:18:58.237 line:5%,start
And I think we both wanted
to vent a little bit.

00:18:58.303 --> 00:19:00.472 line:95%,end
So we thought going to a new little store
would be fun.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:03.275 line:95%,end
So are you good from last night?

00:19:03.342 --> 00:19:05.244 line:95%,end
I was really, really upset.

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:06.512 line:95%,end
I was, too.

00:19:06.578 --> 00:19:08.113 line:95%,end
You know, I ended up storming out, too.

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:09.281 line:95%,end
She's just rude.

00:19:09.348 --> 00:19:12.184 line:95%,end
It upsets me because we were
supposed to have some fun.

00:19:12.251 --> 00:19:13.952 line:95%,end
And they had attacked me
because they're jealous

00:19:14.019 --> 00:19:15.387 line:95%,end
of my nine-year-old daughter.

00:19:15.454 --> 00:19:16.355 line:95%,end
And I think it's ridiculous.

00:19:16.421 --> 00:19:17.856 line:95%,end
Christi screams at me all the time.

00:19:17.923 --> 00:19:19.625 line:95%,end
And you know what I do.
I just sit there.

00:19:20.259 --> 00:19:24.596 line:5%,start
Christi and Kelly gang up on her
because Melissa lets them.

00:19:24.663 --> 00:19:26.265 line:5%,start
I'm not going to let them gang up on me.

00:19:26.765 --> 00:19:27.599 line:95%,end
Jealous much?

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.235 line:95%,end
I think it's obvious.

00:19:30.302 --> 00:19:33.071 line:95%,end
I know she will do what it takes
to get her kids to the top.

00:19:33.138 --> 00:19:36.608 line:95%,end
<i>But at this point,</i>
<i>I have no reason not to trust Melissa.</i>

00:19:36.675 --> 00:19:38.644 line:95%,end
-You're coming this weekend, aren't you?
-Absolutely.

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:39.878 line:95%,end
-All right.
-I'm not--they're not keeping me away.

00:19:39.945 --> 00:19:41.513 line:95%,end
JILL: Don't you ever let them...

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:43.115 line:95%,end
-MELISSA: Heck, no.
-...push you out.

00:19:45.417 --> 00:19:46.518 line:95%,end
-I don't love that.
-MELISSA: Okay.

00:19:46.585 --> 00:19:48.654 line:95%,end
<i>I definitely like Jill.</i>

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:50.656 line:95%,end
She is so much like me.

<i>And we definitely help each other.</i>

00:19:53.592 --> 00:19:56.428 line:95%,end
So I think it's going to be
a real long friendship here.

00:19:56.495 --> 00:19:57.863 line:95%,end
-All right.
-Okay, I'll see you later.

00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:00.332 line:95%,end

Foot, top foot, don't sickle it.

I mean, I want to be a role model.

00:21:31.823 --> 00:21:36.295 line:5%,start
But I kind of just want to be me

Brooke, I'm telling you what,
I brought you back into this group.

This is called me using you.

You're going to go there.
And you're going to win.

00:21:48.707 --> 00:21:52.611 line:95%,end
And you're going to make everybody else
in that acro category go, ah!

That's what I want to see.

00:21:53.745 --> 00:21:55.080 line:95%,end
Understood?

00:21:55.147 --> 00:21:58.150 line:95%,end
Is she still an important member
of this team?


00:21:58.216 --> 00:22:01.987 line:95%,end

And that's contemporary, right?

00:22:21.373 --> 00:22:23.108 line:95%,end
I appreciate your hard work.
I have a surprise...

Kendall actually came up

-I swear to God.
-ABBY: Oh, really?

00:22:50.869 --> 00:22:52.904 line:95%,end
Gianna, you put that Kendall

Perfect.

She's playing the game.

<i>But it doesn't make her kid</i>
<i>a better dancer.</i>

00:23:05.851 --> 00:23:08.053 line:95%,end
This is something we could do
on a regular basis

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:09.421 line:95%,end
if you were game for it.

00:23:09.488 --> 00:23:11.723 line:95%,end
-Sure.

for Kendall.

00:23:14.192 --> 00:23:15.394 line:95%,end
-ABBY: Absolutely.
-What is going on?

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:17.496 line:95%,end

If it's nothing, tell us.

00:23:31.943 --> 00:23:33.478 line:95%,end

Oh.

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:44.956 line:5%,start
Abby is a really big advocate
for, you know, pay me off, give me a gift.

00:23:45.023 --> 00:23:47.359 line:5%,start
But this is taking gifting
to a whole new level.

You guys, it really wasn't
really your business.

Yes, I did something nice

Jill is trying to buy
her way up the pyramid.

you are the new person on the team,

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:13.051 line:95%,end
pay your dues.

00:24:16.521 --> 00:24:18.723 line:95%,end
(gasps) Let's face it.
Let's face it.

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:20.125 line:95%,end
That is what it is. That is...

00:24:20.192 --> 00:24:23.495 line:95%,end
HOLLY: And I do not need Jill
to reprimand me

00:24:23.562 --> 00:24:25.730 line:95%,end
about my attendance.
I'm a grown woman.

00:24:25.797 --> 00:24:27.999 line:95%,end
And I do what I need to do
for my children.

00:24:28.066 --> 00:24:30.202 line:95%,end
I don't need to cheat to get
ahead like some people, Jill.

That's cheating?

I know crazy Dance Moms, you know.

You're acting like
little bitchy school girls.

If I came up with the idea,

00:24:42.781 --> 00:24:44.015 line:95%,end

00:24:54.626 --> 00:24:57.229 line:95%,end
You are buying Abby
and Gianna right now.

00:24:57.295 --> 00:25:01.099 line:95%,end
If you guys are okay
with being second or last,

00:25:01.166 --> 00:25:02.267 line:95%,end
that's your choice.

00:25:02.334 --> 00:25:05.003 line:95%,end
You're mad about Chloe
always being second.

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:06.605 line:95%,end
Chloe is not second.

00:25:06.671 --> 00:25:08.673 line:95%,end
You better not say that again.

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:10.075 line:95%,end
What--where is Chloe?


00:25:11.209 --> 00:25:14.312 line:95%,end

ABBY: We're going to Starbound
in Long Island, New York.

00:25:21.987 --> 00:25:24.256 line:95%,end
So there's going to be some
tough competitors here.

00:25:24.322 --> 00:25:27.025 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:25:31.796 --> 00:25:32.964 line:95%,end
ABBY:
Why are we going this way?

00:25:33.031 --> 00:25:34.566 line:95%,end
Are we getting on the turnpike?

00:25:34.633 --> 00:25:37.202 line:95%,end
If you're getting on the turnpike,
you're going the wrong way.

00:25:37.269 --> 00:25:38.703 line:95%,end
DRIVER:
That's what she's telling me to do.

00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:40.672 line:95%,end
-Who is?
-DRIVER: The GPS.

00:25:40.739 --> 00:25:42.707 line:95%,end
ABBY: The GPS isn't paying you.

00:25:42.774 --> 00:25:44.509 line:95%,end
Where are you going?

00:25:44.576 --> 00:25:46.411 line:5%,start
So this poor guy is just doing his job.

00:25:46.478 --> 00:25:50.982 line:95%,end
And all of a sudden,
he sees this black cloud coming at him.

00:25:51.049 --> 00:25:52.317 line:95%,end
I am Abby Lee Miller.

00:25:52.384 --> 00:25:55.120 line:95%,end
When I ride on a bus somewhere,
you listen to me,

00:25:55.186 --> 00:25:56.621 line:95%,end
not the lady on the GPS,

00:25:56.688 --> 00:25:58.857 line:95%,end
but the lady behind you in your ear.

00:25:58.924 --> 00:26:01.459 line:95%,end
-Oh, I should have listened to you then.
-There you go.

00:26:01.526 --> 00:26:05.130 line:5%,start
I absolutely, positively,
without a doubt,

00:26:05.196 --> 00:26:07.399 line:5%,start
would do a better job driving this bus

00:26:07.465 --> 00:26:08.934 line:95%,end
to Long Island, New York.

00:26:12.003 --> 00:26:13.305 line:95%,end
Here we go.

00:26:13.872 --> 00:26:15.340 line:95%,end
Brooke, you want to grab that bag?

00:26:15.407 --> 00:26:16.641 line:95%,end
Paige, grab your book bag.

00:26:16.708 --> 00:26:18.109 line:95%,end
ABBY: Come on, guys.

00:26:18.176 --> 00:26:19.411 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>We arrive at Starbound.</i>

00:26:19.477 --> 00:26:21.046 line:95%,end
<i>And we're their national champions.</i>

00:26:21.112 --> 00:26:22.747 line:95%,end
Good to see you.

00:26:22.814 --> 00:26:25.183 line:95%,end
So when we come,
we better be on our A game.

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:27.118 line:95%,end
JILL: She's good. Abby,
she's going to stretch even though

00:26:27.185 --> 00:26:29.220 line:95%,end
she doesn't have a solo
or much to do this week.

00:26:29.287 --> 00:26:31.056 line:95%,end
She's--she's part of the team.

00:26:31.122 --> 00:26:32.457 line:95%,end
So we came.

00:26:33.191 --> 00:26:34.392 line:95%,end
What?

00:26:34.459 --> 00:26:35.860 line:95%,end
JILL: Well, I mean,
you made her part of the team

00:26:35.927 --> 00:26:37.295 line:95%,end
even though she doesn't
have much going on.

00:26:37.362 --> 00:26:38.797 line:95%,end
You're busy with everybody else.
I'd still...

00:26:38.863 --> 00:26:40.165 line:95%,end
-ABBY: Well--
-...like her to have...

00:26:40.231 --> 00:26:41.967 line:95%,end
-Yeah.
-...to feel a part of something.

00:26:42.033 --> 00:26:45.270 line:5%,start
I'm going to do what I need to do
to make sure that Abby knows

00:26:45.337 --> 00:26:48.940 line:5%,start
exactly what Kendall can bring
to this group of dancers.

00:26:49.007 --> 00:26:50.742 line:95%,end
-I'm just trying to help...
-Even though you're off probation...

00:26:50.809 --> 00:26:51.943 line:95%,end
-...my daughter.
-...you're the new man on the totem pole.

00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:53.812 line:95%,end
It's the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:26:53.878 --> 00:26:55.680 line:95%,end
If you don't like it, right.

00:26:55.747 --> 00:26:57.782 line:95%,end
This is me trying to work my way up.

00:26:57.849 --> 00:26:59.150 line:95%,end
-ABBY: Right.
-I will do what you tell me.

00:26:59.217 --> 00:27:01.686 line:95%,end
But I'm asking you,
when can Kendall have a solo?

00:27:01.753 --> 00:27:05.557 line:95%,end
When can Kendall be more a part
of what everybody else gets a part of?

00:27:05.624 --> 00:27:07.692 line:95%,end
You need to tell your mother
to knock it off.

00:27:07.759 --> 00:27:09.194 line:95%,end
She's going to get you in trouble.

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:13.431 line:95%,end
I hope that she doesn't think
Kendall being off probation

00:27:13.498 --> 00:27:16.501 line:95%,end
is a free for all
for her to give her opinions.

00:27:16.568 --> 00:27:18.403 line:95%,end
When are you going to do
Kendall's head piece

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:19.771 line:95%,end
and worry about her costume?

00:27:19.838 --> 00:27:21.339 line:95%,end
You're all worried about theirs.

00:27:21.406 --> 00:27:22.240 line:95%,end
Let her dance.

00:27:22.307 --> 00:27:24.175 line:95%,end
KELLY: Brooke is one dance
after Mackenzie.

00:27:24.242 --> 00:27:25.477 line:95%,end
She has not run her dance with her.

00:27:25.543 --> 00:27:27.512 line:95%,end
She didn't help her with the head piece.
She didn't look at her hair.

00:27:27.579 --> 00:27:30.181 line:95%,end
JILL: You know what, Kelly?
Be happy your child has a solo.

00:27:30.248 --> 00:27:31.750 line:95%,end
-She didn't even come...
-Shut up.

00:27:31.816 --> 00:27:33.785 line:95%,end
This kid doesn't have a solo,
the same as yours.

00:27:33.852 --> 00:27:36.187 line:95%,end
-You did not just tell me to shut up.
-Yes.

00:27:38.356 --> 00:27:40.825 line:95%,end
I don't appreciate Kelly
telling me to shut up.

00:27:40.892 --> 00:27:43.261 line:95%,end
You don't tell anybody to shut up.

00:27:43.328 --> 00:27:44.963 line:95%,end
She has a solo.

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:46.064 line:95%,end
I got nothing.

00:27:46.131 --> 00:27:47.832 line:95%,end
Okay, well, last week,
should I have complained because yours

00:27:47.899 --> 00:27:49.868 line:95%,end
-had a solo and neither one of mine did?
-JILL: You did complain.

00:27:49.934 --> 00:27:53.905 line:5%,start
I'm so tired of Jill stepping in
where she doesn't belong.

00:27:53.972 --> 00:27:56.007 line:95%,end
It's like she never stops talking.

00:27:56.074 --> 00:27:57.909 line:95%,end
-Brooke was not here.
-Enough, stop.

00:27:57.976 --> 00:27:59.377 line:95%,end
She came back. She got a solo.

00:27:59.444 --> 00:28:00.645 line:95%,end
She's at the top.

00:28:00.712 --> 00:28:02.380 line:95%,end
Be happy with that.

00:28:02.447 --> 00:28:04.916 line:95%,end
There's no making her happy.

00:28:04.983 --> 00:28:06.351 line:95%,end
She doesn't want to win.
She doesn't want to win.

00:28:06.418 --> 00:28:08.353 line:95%,end
-WOMAN: We're used to being at the bottom.
-She doesn't want to be on the top.

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:09.921 line:95%,end
I need Mackenzie and Brooke
to come with me.

00:28:09.988 --> 00:28:11.756 line:95%,end

00:32:36.621 --> 00:32:38.156 line:95%,end
before the rest of those girls.

00:32:38.222 --> 00:32:39.390 line:95%,end
<i>Brooke rises to the occasion.</i>

00:32:39.457 --> 00:32:42.727 line:95%,end
<i>When she knows she has to beat somebody,</i>
<i>she dances better.</i>

00:32:42.794 --> 00:32:45.330 line:95%,end
I really think she could have won
the whole thing

00:32:45.396 --> 00:32:47.432 line:95%,end
if she would have given 100%.

00:32:47.498 --> 00:32:50.501 line:95%,end
Girls, close your midsections,
tuck your derriere under.

00:32:50.568 --> 00:32:52.303 line:95%,end
You keep using your legs to jump

00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:54.238 line:95%,end
instead of your core, your center.

00:32:54.305 --> 00:32:55.373 line:95%,end
Understood?

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:56.507 line:95%,end
Yes.

00:32:56.574 --> 00:32:57.842 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>The solos are over.</i>

00:32:57.909 --> 00:32:59.410 line:95%,end
<i>Now, it's time for the group number.</i>

00:32:59.477 --> 00:33:00.878 line:95%,end
We have an hour to go.

00:33:00.945 --> 00:33:03.948 line:95%,end
And I am not sure that
they all know what they're doing.

00:33:04.015 --> 00:33:05.783 line:95%,end
I'm actually going to borrow
some lipstick.

00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:08.486 line:95%,end
So Jill, if you would feel better
if I borrow it from you, I will.

00:33:08.553 --> 00:33:10.121 line:95%,end
Would you like me to put it on you?

00:33:10.188 --> 00:33:11.255 line:95%,end
ABBY: I would love it.

00:33:11.322 --> 00:33:13.591 line:95%,end
(indistinct chatter)

00:33:13.658 --> 00:33:16.294 line:95%,end
-Featured part of next week's dance.
-Maybe.

00:33:16.361 --> 00:33:19.130 line:95%,end
If gifts don't work,
maybe helping will.

00:33:21.265 --> 00:33:24.002 line:95%,end
So now, Jill is going to be
Abby's official makeup fixer.

00:33:24.068 --> 00:33:26.204 line:95%,end
And it's going to be like
putting lipstick on a pig.

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:27.905 line:95%,end
Do I need anything else,
a little powder up here?

00:33:27.972 --> 00:33:28.906 line:95%,end
JILL: Mm-hmm.

00:33:28.973 --> 00:33:31.075 line:95%,end
-CHRISTI: Now, who's kissing whose butt?
-I would buy makeup from you.

00:33:31.709 --> 00:33:33.411 line:95%,end
(laughs)

00:33:35.913 --> 00:33:39.584 line:95%,end
JILL: <i>I watched Christi roll her eyes</i>
<i>again and again at me.</i>

00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:41.586 line:95%,end
<i>But I'm not sitting quietly anymore.</i>

00:33:41.652 --> 00:33:45.089 line:95%,end
And if it bothers Christi,
let her eyes roll out of her head.

00:33:45.156 --> 00:33:47.592 line:95%,end
I'm doing what I need to do
for my child.

00:33:47.658 --> 00:33:48.893 line:95%,end
Is it a full moon?

00:33:50.628 --> 00:33:51.796 line:95%,end
What's going on?

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:53.998 line:95%,end
(sighs)

00:33:54.065 --> 00:33:56.167 line:95%,end
-ABBY: Do this.
-All these weird things are happening.

00:33:56.234 --> 00:33:57.068 line:95%,end
ABBY: Just once.

00:33:57.135 --> 00:33:59.070 line:95%,end
You mean like the other night
when you--

00:33:59.137 --> 00:34:01.939 line:95%,end
when you badgered Melissa
right out of the house

00:34:02.006 --> 00:34:04.375 line:95%,end
and then kicked me out of Kelly's house?

00:34:04.442 --> 00:34:06.778 line:95%,end
I didn't badger anybody.
I was just speaking the truth.

00:34:06.844 --> 00:34:08.246 line:95%,end
I did not badger anybody.

00:34:08.312 --> 00:34:10.181 line:95%,end
And you know what?
It wasn't just me. It was...

00:34:10.248 --> 00:34:12.083 line:95%,end
-JILL: You know what? Can I tell you...
-Can I just speak?

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:13.885 line:95%,end
Everybody, stop. Christi's talking.

00:34:13.951 --> 00:34:15.386 line:95%,end
Be quiet, Christi, shut up.

00:34:15.453 --> 00:34:16.654 line:95%,end
How do you like--
how does that feel?

00:34:16.721 --> 00:34:20.358 line:95%,end
Jill, you don't let anybody speak
because you never shut your mouth.

00:34:20.425 --> 00:34:23.494 line:95%,end
Jill needs to learn
that she's new on this team.

00:34:23.561 --> 00:34:26.130 line:95%,end
And if she's going to make it,
she better shh.

00:34:26.197 --> 00:34:27.031 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>Hey, babe.</i>

00:34:27.098 --> 00:34:28.299 line:95%,end
Hey, we're going to rehearse
in the hallway, guys.

00:34:28.366 --> 00:34:29.734 line:95%,end
-There's a good space out there.
-Good. Thank you.

00:34:29.801 --> 00:34:30.835 line:95%,end
Come on, guys.

00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:33.638 line:95%,end
I don't know what's going on
in this room.

00:34:33.704 --> 00:34:36.040 line:95%,end
I'm glad the girls left
because I'll tell you what,

00:34:36.107 --> 00:34:39.410 line:95%,end
some of the language and the yelling,
they get upset.

00:34:39.477 --> 00:34:40.778 line:95%,end
They get worked up.

00:34:40.845 --> 00:34:44.115 line:95%,end
And as much as you guys think
that you're an advocate for your kids,

00:34:44.182 --> 00:34:45.716 line:95%,end
you're sticking up for them,

00:34:45.783 --> 00:34:48.052 line:95%,end
they don't want to see their mother
and their teacher fight.

00:34:48.119 --> 00:34:48.953 line:95%,end
I agree.

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:51.956 line:95%,end
All right, so whatever's going on
in this room, fix it.

00:34:52.023 --> 00:34:53.558 line:95%,end
I'm going backstage.

00:34:53.624 --> 00:34:55.493 line:95%,end
Say your prayers.

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:58.696 line:95%,end
(dramatic music playing)


00:35:00.131 --> 00:35:03.034 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:35:05.336 --> 00:35:07.939 line:95%,end
You are going on in 20 minutes.

00:35:08.005 --> 00:35:09.140 line:95%,end
Some of these numbers,

00:35:09.207 --> 00:35:11.642 line:95%,end
these kids have been working on
since the middle of August.

00:35:11.709 --> 00:35:13.177 line:95%,end
I talked to their teachers.

00:35:13.244 --> 00:35:15.146 line:95%,end
You've had this dance for four days.

00:35:15.213 --> 00:35:18.382 line:5%,start
The group didn't win last week
in the overall high scores.

00:35:18.449 --> 00:35:21.219 line:5%,start
And I know they want to be first.

00:35:21.285 --> 00:35:24.088 line:95%,end
You guys are the national champions.

00:35:24.155 --> 00:35:26.624 line:95%,end
There were all these complaints,
and somebody didn't have a special part,

00:35:26.691 --> 00:35:28.292 line:95%,end
and blah, blah, blah.

00:35:28.359 --> 00:35:30.595 line:95%,end
This is about the group.
It's a team.

00:35:30.661 --> 00:35:31.929 line:95%,end
And when you're in a Broadway show,

00:35:31.996 --> 00:35:35.900 line:95%,end
it doesn't matter if your part is this big
or if you have one line,

00:35:35.967 --> 00:35:38.836 line:95%,end
and when you step out on that stage,
you own it.

00:35:38.903 --> 00:35:39.937 line:95%,end
Understood?

00:35:40.004 --> 00:35:41.005 line:95%,end
Let's do it.

00:35:41.939 --> 00:35:44.742 line:5%,start
MADDIE: This week, we're doing a dance
called Avalanche.

00:35:44.809 --> 00:35:46.911 line:5%,start
And it's like jazzy and ganky.

00:35:46.978 --> 00:35:50.314 line:95%,end
<i>And I think that all of us</i>
<i>are really good at that.</i>

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:54.752 line:95%,end
<i>I'm really happy Brooke is back.</i>

00:35:54.819 --> 00:35:58.756 line:95%,end
And I think we'll do what we do best
and that is win.

00:35:58.823 --> 00:36:00.491 line:95%,end
Girls, we're next.

00:36:00.558 --> 00:36:01.926 line:95%,end
(applause)

00:36:01.993 --> 00:36:05.363 line:95%,end
ANNOUNCER:
<i>This is number 320, Avalanche.</i>

00:36:05.429 --> 00:36:07.665 line:95%,end

SINGER: <i>âª Oh, oh, oh âª</i>

00:36:17.775 --> 00:36:19.443 line:95%,end
<i>âª You send me a text âª</i>

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:21.112 line:95%,end
<i>âª And you call my phone âª</i>

00:36:21.179 --> 00:36:24.348 line:95%,end
<i>âª And every time,</i>
<i>you got to say good bye âª</i>

00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:28.853 line:95%,end
<i>âª You always tell me</i>
<i>I should come alone âª</i>

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:32.256 line:95%,end
<i>âª And then you keep me in disguise âª</i>

00:36:33.658 --> 00:36:37.695 line:95%,end
<i>âª Your love is oh, oh, oh âª</i>

00:36:37.762 --> 00:36:40.898 line:95%,end
<i>âª Your love is, your love is âª</i>

00:36:40.965 --> 00:36:42.466 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>I don't know</i>
<i>if I quite got the group number</i>

00:36:42.533 --> 00:36:44.969 line:5%,start
because they came out
and they were sassy.

00:36:45.036 --> 00:36:46.837 line:5%,start
Then they're choking themselves.

00:36:46.904 --> 00:36:48.339 line:95%,end
<i>Did I miss the memo?</i>

00:36:48.406 --> 00:36:50.041 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:36:50.107 --> 00:36:51.409 line:95%,end
SINGER: <i>âª I cannot breathe âª</i>

00:36:51.475 --> 00:36:53.678 line:95%,end
<i>âª My thoughts are closing âª</i>

00:36:53.744 --> 00:36:57.748 line:95%,end
<i>âª In your avalanche âª</i>

00:36:57.815 --> 00:37:01.852 line:95%,end
<i>âª I cannot move when you hold me âª</i>

00:37:01.919 --> 00:37:06.057 line:95%,end
<i>âª I want to scream but no one hears me âª</i>

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:12.863 line:95%,end
(applause)

00:37:13.965 --> 00:37:15.499 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>They did a very nice job.</i>

00:37:15.566 --> 00:37:19.503 line:95%,end
They could always have more energy,
more attack, more enthusiasm.

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:22.406 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:37:26.944 --> 00:37:28.346 line:5%,start
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Top Junior groups, are you ready?</i>

00:37:28.412 --> 00:37:29.981 line:5%,start
<i>Here we go.</i>

00:37:30.047 --> 00:37:32.717 line:95%,end
<i>Third place today, Car Wash</i>
<i>(indistinct)</i>

PAIGE: <i>I think I did really good</i>
<i>in the group number</i>

00:37:35.319 --> 00:37:37.054 line:5%,start
because I did everything
the best I could.

00:37:37.121 --> 00:37:38.856 line:5%,start
And I didn't really mess anything up.

00:37:38.923 --> 00:37:40.958 line:95%,end
<i>And I think we might win.</i>

00:37:41.025 --> 00:37:42.326 line:95%,end
ANNOUNCER: <i>Top two.</i>

00:37:42.393 --> 00:37:45.062 line:95%,end
<i>Both of these groups</i>

00:37:45.129 --> 00:37:47.698 line:95%,end
<i>And it's not easy</i>

00:37:47.765 --> 00:37:49.867 line:95%,end
<i>In second place today</i>

ABBY: The group didn't win.

00:37:58.209 --> 00:38:00.344 line:95%,end
Hey, we were in Long Island,
New York.


00:38:00.411 --> 00:38:02.580 line:95%,end
<i>Those kids have soul</i>

00:38:02.647 --> 00:38:04.849 line:95%,end
<i>and the heart for dance.</i>

00:38:04.915 --> 00:38:06.117 line:95%,end
Some of my kids do.

00:38:06.183 --> 00:38:08.019 line:95%,end
And some of my kids don't.

00:38:08.085 --> 00:38:10.354 line:95%,end
And they better get it real quick.

00:38:10.421 --> 00:38:12.623 line:95%,end
<i>Congratulations,</i>
<i>a great score today.</i>

00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:15.092 line:95%,end
<i>-Fantastic job.</i>

00:38:15.159 --> 00:38:17.495 line:95%,end
Woo!

00:38:17.561 --> 00:38:18.963 line:95%,end
Good job! Good job.

00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:20.564 line:95%,end
Good job.
You guys should be proud.

00:38:21.766 --> 00:38:23.668 line:95%,end
WOMAN:
Hey, Abby, what did you think?

00:38:23.734 --> 00:38:26.737 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>This is two weeks in a row</i>
<i>that we didn't win.</i>

00:38:26.804 --> 00:38:30.041 line:95%,end
Second is the first one to lose.

00:38:30.107 --> 00:38:32.176 line:95%,end
You're the biggest loser on that stage.

00:38:32.243 --> 00:38:34.679 line:95%,end
And that's not going to happen
to the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:38:34.745 --> 00:38:36.647 line:95%,end
You just need to be better dancers.

00:38:36.714 --> 00:38:38.215 line:95%,end
You need to out dance everybody.

00:38:38.282 --> 00:38:40.618 line:95%,end
HOLLY:
<i>Coming in second is not losing.</i>

00:38:40.685 --> 00:38:42.019 line:5%,start
They did their best.

00:38:42.086 --> 00:38:44.088 line:5%,start
And their best just wasn't
good enough this day.

00:38:44.155 --> 00:38:46.023 line:95%,end
I don't know.
What did you all think?

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:47.291 line:95%,end
JILL: They did it really good.

00:38:47.358 --> 00:38:49.627 line:95%,end
And their really good
wasn't good enough to win.

00:38:49.694 --> 00:38:51.228 line:95%,end
And that's kind of depressing.

00:38:51.295 --> 00:38:54.098 line:95%,end
Next week, you either win big

00:38:54.165 --> 00:38:55.566 line:95%,end
or lose big.

00:38:55.633 --> 00:38:57.101 line:95%,end
But don't be second.

00:38:57.168 --> 00:38:58.803 line:95%,end
Now that I have the kids out of here,

00:38:58.869 --> 00:39:00.871 line:95%,end
I just want to make sure
when I left earlier,

00:39:00.938 --> 00:39:03.507 line:95%,end
I had said something about the vibe
being off in here.

00:39:04.208 --> 00:39:05.776 line:95%,end
HOLLY:
<i>There's a tension in the room.</i>

00:39:05.843 --> 00:39:06.877 line:95%,end
Something's out of sync.

00:39:06.944 --> 00:39:10.014 line:95%,end
<i>And I suspect I know what it is.</i>

00:39:10.081 --> 00:39:11.182 line:95%,end
<i>We're not connected.</i>

00:39:11.248 --> 00:39:12.650 line:95%,end
<i>And we're not cohesive.</i>

00:39:12.717 --> 00:39:16.987 line:95%,end
And that strain is becoming
very apparent to everybody.

00:39:18.222 --> 00:39:20.358 line:95%,end
Jill, you're not on probation anymore.

00:39:20.424 --> 00:39:21.659 line:95%,end
I understand that.

00:39:21.726 --> 00:39:23.894 line:95%,end
But earlier, it was on and on and on
about how come

00:39:23.961 --> 00:39:25.529 line:95%,end
your kid's not doing something special.

00:39:25.596 --> 00:39:28.065 line:95%,end
Abby Lee Miller
was not put on this earth

00:39:28.132 --> 00:39:29.967 line:95%,end
to make your kid feel special.

00:39:30.034 --> 00:39:31.168 line:95%,end
Understood?

00:39:31.235 --> 00:39:34.672 line:95%,end
It's about getting these kids
to where they need to be.

00:39:34.739 --> 00:39:35.873 line:95%,end
Jill doesn't know it.

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:37.908 line:95%,end
But she just put herself on probation.

00:39:38.442 --> 00:39:40.277 line:95%,end
<i>If she opens her mouth one more time</i>

00:39:40.344 --> 00:39:42.313 line:95%,end
<i>and starts bitching about something,</i>

00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:45.116 line:95%,end
she is going to be walking
right out that door,

00:39:45.182 --> 00:39:48.352 line:95%,end
never to be seen or heard of again.

00:39:48.419 --> 00:39:50.821 line:95%,end
I cannot stand this bickering.

00:39:51.322 --> 00:39:53.524 line:95%,end
If I have to lose somebody
on this team

00:39:53.591 --> 00:39:56.327 line:95%,end
to make it a cohesive group,
I will do that.

00:39:56.394 --> 00:39:57.895 line:95%,end
Do you understand?

00:39:57.962 --> 00:39:58.963 line:95%,end
Yes?

00:40:00.831 --> 00:40:02.400 line:95%,end
JILL: <i>I left a great studio.</i>

00:40:02.466 --> 00:40:04.668 line:5%,start
I was perfectly happy where I was.

00:40:04.735 --> 00:40:07.138 line:95%,end
<i>I've done nothing</i>
<i>but try to get along.</i>

00:40:07.204 --> 00:40:09.039 line:95%,end
And they've done nothing
but beat me down.

00:40:09.106 --> 00:40:10.441 line:95%,end
<i>I'm sick of it.</i>

00:40:10.508 --> 00:40:13.411 line:95%,end
-I'm here to take care of Kendall.
-CHRISTI: That's fine, Jill, but...

00:40:13.477 --> 00:40:15.546 line:95%,end
-You guys have all this history with Abby.
-We do have a lot of history.

00:40:15.613 --> 00:40:17.782 line:95%,end
JILL: You and her
are the first to tell me that.

00:40:17.848 --> 00:40:20.451 line:95%,end
And we are a very cohesive team.

00:40:20.518 --> 00:40:22.186 line:95%,end
-And we have been.
-Well, you know what?

00:40:22.253 --> 00:40:24.054 line:95%,end
Maybe I don't fit in the team then.

00:40:24.121 --> 00:40:27.091 line:95%,end
You can't for one second say,
I understand.

00:40:27.158 --> 00:40:29.026 line:95%,end
It must be hard to come in with--

00:40:29.093 --> 00:40:32.630 line:5%,start
with four really strong personalities
and Abby.

00:40:32.696 --> 00:40:35.900 line:5%,start
You know, no one gave me
or Kendall any credit

00:40:35.966 --> 00:40:37.835 line:5%,start
for wanting to be a part of this team.

00:40:37.902 --> 00:40:41.372 line:5%,start
And all you do
is come down on me nonstop

00:40:41.439 --> 00:40:43.707 line:5%,start
about anything I try to do
to get Kendall

00:40:43.774 --> 00:40:46.377 line:5%,start
more a part of the team
and be a part of it.

00:40:46.444 --> 00:40:48.746 line:5%,start
So maybe we're not a part of the team.

00:40:48.813 --> 00:40:50.548 line:5%,start
<i>They pushed me out of that door.</i>

00:40:50.614 --> 00:40:51.715 line:5%,start
But I'm not leaving.

00:40:51.782 --> 00:40:54.618 line:5%,start
<i>I'm coming back with my guns drawn.</i>

00:40:54.685 --> 00:40:57.288 line:5%,start
They're not going
to shove me out anymore.

00:40:57.354 --> 00:40:59.056 line:5%,start
(tense music playing)
