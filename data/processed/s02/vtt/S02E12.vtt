ABBY: <i>Previously on</i>
Dance Moms...

00:00:03.636 --> 00:00:04.471 line:5%,start
Uh-oh.

00:00:04.537 --> 00:00:06.072 line:5%,start
(gasps) She just
twisted her ankle.

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:07.907 line:5%,start
If it gets worse,
we have to pull her.

00:00:07.974 --> 00:00:09.542 line:5%,start
Everybody else
has to learn to adjust.

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:10.877 line:5%,start
I think that's what
she's afraid of.

00:00:10.944 --> 00:00:13.313 line:5%,start
We're talking about
what you enable to happen.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.714 line:5%,start
I don't want to dance
here anymore, Maddie.

00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:15.782 line:5%,start
I'm sick of it.

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.084 line:5%,start
Melissa plays
the "I'm so nice" part,

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:20.653 line:5%,start
and she's the sneakiest,
most underhanded person of them all.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.556 line:5%,start
ABBY: <i>I'm sitting in my seat</i>

00:00:23.623 --> 00:00:25.191 line:5%,start
<i>Boom, forgets another part.</i>

00:00:25.258 --> 00:00:28.428 line:5%,start
Don't set them
up to be okay to fail.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.332 line:5%,start
Coming up on <i>Dance Moms...</i>

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.933 line:5%,start
We are here in New York City.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.536 line:5%,start
You're going to be going to
the Joffrey Ballet School.

00:00:36.603 --> 00:00:37.937 line:5%,start
You guys need to fight for this.

00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:39.406 line:5%,start
(indistinct chatter)

00:00:39.472 --> 00:00:40.440 line:5%,start
Don't you hear it?

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:42.976 line:5%,start
Hi!

00:00:44.277 --> 00:00:46.112 line:5%,start
ABBY: This is about your kid
having an audition tomorrow

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:47.380 line:5%,start
and her brain
not being in her head.

00:00:47.447 --> 00:00:49.282 line:5%,start
You don't respect me
and you don't respect these girls.

00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:51.684 line:5%,start
-CATHY: Talk to her as well.
-You've just got to now focus, please.

00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:52.619 line:5%,start
(door closes)

00:00:52.685 --> 00:00:55.488 line:5%,start
ABBY: My entire reputation
is humiliated.

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:56.623 line:5%,start
Shh, shh, shh.

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:57.824 line:5%,start
Abby's going to hate me.

00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:59.826 line:5%,start
Your kids and fine without me.

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:03.229 line:95%,end
(theme music playing)

(upbeat music playing)

00:01:17.477 --> 00:01:19.345 line:5%,start
ABBY: All right, here we are.

00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:20.713 line:95%,end
Let's go.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.482 line:95%,end
<i>This week the girls and I</i>
<i>are in New York City</i>

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:25.218 line:5%,start
to rehearse
for a Joffrey Ballet audition.

00:01:25.718 --> 00:01:27.487 line:95%,end
Come on, ladies.
Let's go.

00:01:28.188 --> 00:01:30.990 line:95%,end
<i>For these little girls,</i>
<i>this is a chance of a lifetime.</i>

00:01:31.057 --> 00:01:33.159 line:95%,end
<i>I don't want to see</i>
<i>any of them blow it.</i>

00:01:33.226 --> 00:01:36.229 line:95%,end
<i>This competition season</i>
<i>has been extremely tough</i>

00:01:36.296 --> 00:01:37.764 line:95%,end
<i>and extremely rewarding,</i>

00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:39.099 line:95%,end
<i>but I think the kids are ready</i>

00:01:39.165 --> 00:01:41.701 line:95%,end
<i>for whatever</i>
<i>New York City has to offer.</i>

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:43.603 line:95%,end
They want to show
their own talents

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.939 line:95%,end
and I think this is
a great opportunity.

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:48.374 line:95%,end
Girls, this is the big time.

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:50.677 line:95%,end
We are here in New York City

00:01:50.743 --> 00:01:54.447 line:95%,end
in the dance Mecca
of the world right here.

00:01:54.514 --> 00:01:56.149 line:95%,end
And I want you
to take it all in.

00:01:56.216 --> 00:01:58.384 line:95%,end
Everybody you pass
on that street

00:01:59.085 --> 00:02:02.088 line:95%,end
probably took a dance lesson
at some point in their life.

00:02:02.155 --> 00:02:03.356 line:95%,end
Do you understand that?

00:02:03.423 --> 00:02:05.558 line:95%,end
Yes, there's a lot of kids
that win competitions,

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:07.961 line:95%,end
a lot of kids who get crowns
on their heads,

00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:10.864 line:95%,end
and there's a handful
that make it in the industry.

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:13.032 line:95%,end
Remember that.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.735 line:95%,end
I want to talk about
Michigan first.

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:18.571 line:95%,end
We are not going to win
a group dance

00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:23.042 line:95%,end
until everybody in this group
is on the same level.

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:26.112 line:5%,start
PRESENTER: <i>Number (indistinct) 1A,</i>
<i>"Wipe Them Out,"</i>

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:27.914 line:5%,start
<i>Star Dance Studio.</i>

00:02:28.281 --> 00:02:31.251 line:95%,end
When parts of the choreography
are in unison,

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:32.819 line:95%,end
you all need to be in unison.

00:02:32.886 --> 00:02:33.720 line:95%,end
That's what it means.

00:02:33.786 --> 00:02:35.588 line:95%,end
<i>Last week,</i>
<i>these girls lost again.</i>

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:36.990 line:95%,end
<i>They were sloppy.</i>

00:02:37.056 --> 00:02:38.224 line:95%,end
<i>Their timing was off.</i>

00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:39.893 line:95%,end
<i>They need to bond as a group.</i>

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.529 line:95%,end
It's not always
about your solos.

00:02:42.595 --> 00:02:44.197 line:95%,end
It's about that group,

00:02:44.264 --> 00:02:45.598 line:95%,end
and you need
to learn the dance in a group.

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:47.700 line:95%,end
If you don't apply
the corrections,

00:02:48.434 --> 00:02:49.903 line:95%,end
you're not going to improve.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.738 line:95%,end
And that's the issue.

00:02:51.804 --> 00:02:53.339 line:95%,end
<i>Until they realize that,</i>

00:02:54.207 --> 00:02:55.608 line:95%,end
it's not going to happen.

00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:57.644 line:95%,end
Now, on with the pyramid.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.812 line:5%,start
Luckily the pyramid
found its way to Manhattan.

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:00.847 line:5%,start
Yay.

00:03:00.914 --> 00:03:02.115 line:95%,end
On the bottom
of the pyramid...

00:03:03.283 --> 00:03:04.250 line:95%,end
is Paige.

00:03:04.317 --> 00:03:05.652 line:95%,end
Did you correct the arms?

00:03:05.718 --> 00:03:06.686 line:95%,end
Yes.

00:03:07.253 --> 00:03:08.621 line:95%,end
Did you put the phone away?

00:03:09.088 --> 00:03:09.989 line:95%,end
No.

00:03:10.056 --> 00:03:13.793 line:95%,end
She gets no credit for doing
her back tuck or her press or--

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.428 line:95%,end
-Credit?
-It's her phone.

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:18.131 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>I thought watching</i>
<i>Paige in the group number,</i>

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:19.165 line:95%,end
<i>I thought she did great.</i>

00:03:19.232 --> 00:03:21.501 line:5%,start
I just don't think that Abby
gives her enough credit.

00:03:21.568 --> 00:03:22.835 line:95%,end
<i>She always sticks her</i>
<i>in the back</i>

00:03:22.902 --> 00:03:24.404 line:95%,end
<i>and doesn't pay</i>
<i>attention to her,</i>

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.272 line:95%,end
<i>and I think</i>
<i>she can hold her own.</i>


00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:29.576 line:95%,end
I think she's fine in the group.

00:03:29.642 --> 00:03:30.510 line:95%,end
ABBY: Next,

00:03:31.778 --> 00:03:32.879 line:95%,end
Mackenzie.

00:03:32.946 --> 00:03:37.150 line:95%,end
You can improv if you're early
on the music in a solo.

00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:39.018 line:95%,end
But when you do it in a trio

00:03:39.085 --> 00:03:40.453 line:95%,end
and you don't tell
the other two partners

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.155 line:95%,end
to do it ahead of time,

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:44.023 line:95%,end
you make them look like idiots
because you were out there,

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.592 line:95%,end
woo, shaking it up.

00:03:45.658 --> 00:03:46.659 line:95%,end
Understood?

00:03:48.861 --> 00:03:50.630 line:95%,end
Next, Chloe.

00:03:51.197 --> 00:03:52.332 line:95%,end
Time to face the music.

00:03:52.932 --> 00:03:53.833 line:95%,end
Forgot your routine.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.938 line:95%,end
SINGER: <i>âª Remain</i>
<i>when watercolors fade âª</i>

00:03:59.005 --> 00:04:00.440 line:95%,end
You're not seven anymore.

00:04:00.506 --> 00:04:01.441 line:95%,end
You're 10 years old.

00:04:01.507 --> 00:04:03.843 line:95%,end
You can't make up
your own thing and wait to get back

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.246 line:95%,end
onto the music
when 35 other dancers

00:04:06.312 --> 00:04:07.547 line:95%,end
are doing the right thing.

00:04:08.214 --> 00:04:09.382 line:95%,end
That's a pink slip.

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:10.917 line:95%,end
That's the unemployment line.

00:04:10.984 --> 00:04:12.118 line:95%,end
Understood?

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:15.755 line:95%,end
Next, Nia.

00:04:15.822 --> 00:04:16.956 line:95%,end
You hurt your foot.

00:04:17.023 --> 00:04:18.324 line:95%,end
You worked through it.

00:04:18.391 --> 00:04:19.692 line:95%,end
It all worked out.

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:21.761 line:95%,end
However, it's the technique.

00:04:21.828 --> 00:04:24.797 line:95%,end
And it's like we tell you
over and over, it's up to you.

00:04:24.864 --> 00:04:26.899 line:95%,end
Do you want to fix it?
Do you want to make it better?

00:04:26.966 --> 00:04:27.800 line:95%,end
Then you will.

00:04:28.668 --> 00:04:29.569 line:95%,end
Understood?

00:04:30.737 --> 00:04:33.206 line:95%,end
Next, we have Brooke.

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:35.975 line:95%,end
Brooke, you did
what you needed to do.

00:04:36.042 --> 00:04:38.945 line:95%,end
But you always just do
what you needed to do.

00:04:39.012 --> 00:04:40.513 line:95%,end
I want to see more from you.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:41.447 line:5%,start
I'd love to give her more,

00:04:41.514 --> 00:04:43.516 line:5%,start
but Miss Abby spends all her time
with all the other girls.

00:04:44.784 --> 00:04:48.288 line:95%,end
And on top again is Maddie.

00:04:48.354 --> 00:04:51.557 line:95%,end
I challenge you
to keep winning your solos

00:04:51.624 --> 00:04:53.226 line:95%,end
because you pick up quickly.

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:54.494 line:95%,end
MELISSA: <i>No big surprise.</i>

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.662 line:95%,end
<i>For the fifth week in a row,</i>

00:04:55.728 --> 00:04:57.530 line:95%,end
Maddie reigns supreme
at the top of the pyramid.

00:04:57.597 --> 00:04:59.866 line:95%,end
I want to talk about
after the competition.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.303 line:95%,end
The scout from
the Joffrey Ballet School

00:05:03.369 --> 00:05:05.305 line:95%,end
came to our dressing room.

00:05:05.371 --> 00:05:07.940 line:95%,end
They chose
the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:05:08.007 --> 00:05:11.010 line:95%,end
<i>The Joffrey Ballet School</i>
<i>has huge history here.</i>

00:05:11.077 --> 00:05:14.647 line:95%,end
Robert Joffrey started
the school in 1953.

00:05:14.714 --> 00:05:17.917 line:95%,end
<i>There are people from all over</i>
<i>the world coming here to train.</i>

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:20.620 line:95%,end
You're going to be going
to the Joffrey School

00:05:20.687 --> 00:05:22.622 line:95%,end
with some of the most
prestigious instructors

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:23.623 line:95%,end
in all of New York.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:24.857 line:95%,end
<i>Throughout the year,</i>

00:05:24.924 --> 00:05:28.194 line:95%,end
Joffrey auditions
over 20,000 dancers

00:05:28.261 --> 00:05:30.330 line:95%,end
for their Summer Intensive program,

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.866 line:95%,end
and they only give
a handful of scholarships away.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.969 line:95%,end
If one of my girls
would get those scholarships,

00:05:37.036 --> 00:05:39.405 line:95%,end
that would just be
another feather in my cap.

00:05:39.472 --> 00:05:40.673 line:95%,end
The judges
that are judging you

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.042 line:95%,end
are three instructors
at the Joffrey School.

00:05:43.109 --> 00:05:45.178 line:95%,end
They're going to look at feet,

00:05:45.244 --> 00:05:47.447 line:95%,end
turnout, body lines.

00:05:47.513 --> 00:05:49.949 line:95%,end
Everything you've learned
up until this point

00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:52.185 line:95%,end
is going to come
into play in this audition.

00:05:52.251 --> 00:05:53.986 line:95%,end
MELISSA: <i>I have to tell you</i>
<i>that I'm very nervous</i>

00:05:54.053 --> 00:05:58.057 line:95%,end
<i>for our girls to be auditioning</i>
<i>for the Joffrey Ballet School</i>

00:05:58.124 --> 00:06:01.527 line:5%,start
simply because our girls
don't get a lot of ballet anymore,

00:06:01.594 --> 00:06:04.931 line:95%,end
so I hope that they don't
embarrass themselves.

00:06:04.997 --> 00:06:06.232 line:95%,end
You guys need to fight for this.

00:06:06.833 --> 00:06:09.335 line:95%,end
We have to work
on a ballet combination today.

00:06:09.736 --> 00:06:13.339 line:95%,end
We have to work on
a short presentation

00:06:13.406 --> 00:06:15.875 line:95%,end
for each one of you to do
when you go into that audition.

00:06:15.942 --> 00:06:18.044 line:95%,end
I expected you
to look like ballerinas.

00:06:19.011 --> 00:06:20.446 line:95%,end
I'm shocked at the way
you're dressed.

00:06:20.513 --> 00:06:22.749 line:95%,end
Here you are in New York City

00:06:22.815 --> 00:06:25.118 line:95%,end
going to a professional dance studio.

00:06:25.184 --> 00:06:27.186 line:95%,end
You never know
who's going to be there.

00:06:27.253 --> 00:06:28.821 line:95%,end
You never know
who's going to see you.

00:06:29.756 --> 00:06:31.290 line:95%,end
You always want
to look your best.

00:06:31.357 --> 00:06:33.760 line:95%,end
You're going to have
a pinks tights on.

00:06:33.826 --> 00:06:35.261 line:95%,end
You're going to have a leotard on.

00:06:35.328 --> 00:06:37.130 line:95%,end
You're going to have
your hair in a bun.

00:06:37.196 --> 00:06:39.365 line:95%,end
So moms, you're going
to have to go out,

00:06:39.432 --> 00:06:41.234 line:95%,end
you're going to have
to hit the dance wear store,

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.269 line:95%,end
and I want them looking
like ballerinas.

00:06:43.336 --> 00:06:44.470 line:95%,end
The look is half the battle.

00:06:44.537 --> 00:06:45.938 line:95%,end
Mommy's not going to be there.

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:48.474 line:95%,end
Abby's not going to be in there.

00:06:48.541 --> 00:06:49.776 line:95%,end
It's you.

00:06:49.842 --> 00:06:51.544 line:95%,end
You either sink or swim.


00:06:52.712 --> 00:06:54.147 line:95%,end
And please don't embarrass me.

00:06:54.981 --> 00:06:56.349 line:95%,end
CHLOE: <i>It's a really big deal</i>

00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:57.950 line:95%,end
<i>to dance at the Joffrey Ballet School,</i>

00:06:58.017 --> 00:06:58.985 line:95%,end
<i>especially when you're young.</i>

00:06:59.051 --> 00:07:01.888 line:5%,start
Performing for a huge audience

00:07:01.954 --> 00:07:04.190 line:5%,start
actually doesn't really get me
that nervous,

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:06.392 line:95%,end
<i>but performing for like three of--</i>

00:07:06.459 --> 00:07:08.828 line:95%,end
like amazing ballerinas, it's--

00:07:08.895 --> 00:07:10.930 line:95%,end
that's a little nerve-racking.

00:07:10.997 --> 00:07:12.665 line:95%,end
ABBY: In addition to our rehearsals

00:07:12.732 --> 00:07:14.066 line:95%,end
for this ballet audition,

00:07:14.133 --> 00:07:16.803 line:95%,end
we are also going
to be working on a number.

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:18.604 line:95%,end
You heard that right.

00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:23.042 line:95%,end
So we will be attending
Starbound Competition

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:25.077 line:95%,end
in Paramus, New Jersey.

00:07:26.813 --> 00:07:28.948 line:95%,end
And the competition
is going to be fierce.

00:07:29.015 --> 00:07:30.683 line:95%,end
<i>I've had it with these girls.</i>

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.952 line:95%,end
We are going
to Starbound this weekend

00:07:33.019 --> 00:07:34.821 line:95%,end
and they have
a reputation to uphold.

00:07:34.887 --> 00:07:37.490 line:95%,end
They are reigning
national champions.

00:07:37.557 --> 00:07:40.526 line:95%,end
I expect them to win,
and they're going to do it.

00:07:40.593 --> 00:07:43.162 line:95%,end
Ladies, our group routine this week

00:07:43.229 --> 00:07:45.264 line:95%,end
is about a very serious topic.

00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:46.365 line:95%,end
Again?

00:07:46.432 --> 00:07:50.570 line:95%,end
Let me just say,
each one of you is in jail.

00:07:51.804 --> 00:07:56.075 line:95%,end
I had a brilliant idea to do
kind of a take on

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:59.212 line:95%,end
an old number from
the Broadway show <i>Chicago.</i>

00:07:59.278 --> 00:08:04.016 line:95%,end
<i>But I want to water it down</i>
<i>for nine, ten, eleven-year-olds.</i>

00:08:04.083 --> 00:08:05.785 line:95%,end
So they're like jailbirds.

00:08:05.852 --> 00:08:09.055 line:95%,end
It's dark,
it's a bit avant-garde,

00:08:09.121 --> 00:08:10.523 line:95%,end
and it's going to be fun.

00:08:11.524 --> 00:08:14.393 line:5%,start
It's very weird being in jail

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:17.396 line:5%,start
because I've never been
there before.

00:08:17.997 --> 00:08:21.300 line:95%,end
Chloe, you just came off a solo.

00:08:21.367 --> 00:08:22.568 line:95%,end
You forgot your routine.

00:08:22.902 --> 00:08:24.737 line:95%,end
You got to get right
back on that horse.

00:08:24.804 --> 00:08:26.873 line:95%,end
You're going to be doing
a solo this weekend.

00:08:27.406 --> 00:08:31.410 line:95%,end
Maddie, you've been undefeated

00:08:31.477 --> 00:08:32.945 line:95%,end
for the last few weeks,

00:08:33.012 --> 00:08:34.714 line:95%,end
so I'm challenging you once again

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:36.482 line:95%,end
to do a solo at Starbound.

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:39.151 line:95%,end
This might be
the busiest week of your life.

00:08:39.218 --> 00:08:40.720 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>Abby bit off more</i>
<i>than she could chew last week</i>

00:08:40.786 --> 00:08:43.289 line:95%,end
with trios and solos
and group dances,

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:45.491 line:95%,end
and this week we're doing
group dances and solos

00:08:45.558 --> 00:08:47.193 line:95%,end
and the Joffrey audition.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.028 line:95%,end
Can't we just focus on one thing?

00:08:49.095 --> 00:08:50.563 line:95%,end
ABBY: I know that
I'm putting the pressure on you.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:51.697 line:95%,end
But you know what?

00:08:51.764 --> 00:08:53.833 line:95%,end
There's a time for pressure
and it's right now.

00:08:54.233 --> 00:08:56.469 line:95%,end
You are representing
the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:08:56.536 --> 00:08:59.138 line:95%,end
You are representing
32 years of history.

00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:00.840 line:95%,end
Do you understand that?

00:09:00.907 --> 00:09:02.108 line:95%,end
Don't blow it.

00:09:02.441 --> 00:09:05.244 line:5%,start
(quirky music playing)

00:09:07.313 --> 00:09:08.347 line:95%,end
CATHY: <i>Girls, come on in.</i>

00:09:08.414 --> 00:09:10.917 line:95%,end
I have a really
spectacular announcement

00:09:10.983 --> 00:09:11.884 line:95%,end
that I want to make.

00:09:11.951 --> 00:09:15.755 line:95%,end
I found out
that Joffrey Ballet

00:09:15.821 --> 00:09:17.323 line:95%,end
is having open auditions

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:20.826 line:95%,end
in my most favorite city in the world.

00:09:20.893 --> 00:09:22.128 line:95%,end
KIDS: New York.

00:09:22.194 --> 00:09:23.162 line:95%,end
New York.

00:09:23.229 --> 00:09:25.598 line:5%,start
I've got a lot of work
that I have to do.

00:09:25.665 --> 00:09:29.168 line:95%,end
<i>I think that we are completely ready</i>

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:30.870 line:95%,end
<i>to go up against</i>

00:09:30.937 --> 00:09:32.271 line:95%,end
some of Abby's dancers

00:09:32.338 --> 00:09:35.608 line:95%,end
and audition
for a scholarship to Joffrey.

00:09:35.675 --> 00:09:37.977 line:95%,end
We're going to hit the audition,

00:09:38.044 --> 00:09:41.447 line:95%,end
and then we're
going to New Jersey

00:09:41.514 --> 00:09:43.649 line:95%,end
because Starbound is there.

00:09:43.716 --> 00:09:45.151 line:95%,end
Is Abby going to be there?

00:09:45.217 --> 00:09:47.286 line:95%,end
CATHY: Yeah, pressure's on,
Miss Kendall.

00:09:47.353 --> 00:09:50.489 line:95%,end
There's probably going to be
more and more events

00:09:50.556 --> 00:09:52.525 line:95%,end
that we run into Abby.
That's just the way it is.

00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:54.427 line:95%,end
I think that we probably
have better ballet training

00:09:54.493 --> 00:09:55.728 line:95%,end
than they do, but we'll see.

00:09:55.795 --> 00:09:58.230 line:95%,end
Abby is way stuck
in vaudeville.

00:09:58.297 --> 00:10:02.201 line:95%,end
She's still dancing
on a 1940s stage with her mom,

00:10:02.268 --> 00:10:06.472 line:95%,end
<i>and we have a wonderful routine</i>
<i>that is very heartfelt</i>

00:10:06.539 --> 00:10:09.075 line:95%,end
that I think that finally
we may be able

00:10:09.141 --> 00:10:11.043 line:95%,end
to beat Abby with this number.

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:12.178 line:95%,end
And go.

00:10:12.244 --> 00:10:13.846 line:95%,end
One, two, three.

00:10:13.913 --> 00:10:15.381 line:95%,end
Two, two, three.

00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:16.349 line:95%,end
Boom!


00:10:17.817 --> 00:10:20.853 line:5%,start
(pensive music playing)

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:24.056 line:5%,start
ABBY: <i>Pick out something</i>
<i>from one of your solos,</i>

00:10:24.123 --> 00:10:25.658 line:5%,start
something that is amazing

00:10:25.725 --> 00:10:27.927 line:5%,start
that you do better
than anybody else does.

00:10:27.994 --> 00:10:30.262 line:5%,start
But the Abby Lee Dance Company
is going to concentrate

00:10:30.329 --> 00:10:32.164 line:5%,start
on two main things,

00:10:32.231 --> 00:10:34.300 line:95%,end
<i>the Joffrey Ballet audition,</i>

00:10:34.367 --> 00:10:37.903 line:95%,end
<i>and the very next day</i>
<i>the Starbound competition.</i>

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:40.439 line:95%,end
I don't think that you understand quite
how important this is.

00:10:40.506 --> 00:10:42.942 line:95%,end
I mean, you cannot go in there
and look like a slacker.

00:10:43.009 --> 00:10:45.511 line:95%,end
I think just walking
into the Joffrey School

00:10:45.578 --> 00:10:47.246 line:95%,end
is going to be
tough on these kids.

00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:48.948 line:95%,end
They are not little Trinas.

00:10:49.015 --> 00:10:52.551 line:95%,end
<i>They don't take ballet class</i>
<i>every single day all day long,</i>

00:10:52.618 --> 00:10:54.587 line:95%,end
<i>so I think it's going</i>
<i>to be intimidating,</i>

00:10:54.654 --> 00:10:56.622 line:95%,end
I think they're going
to be frightened,

00:10:56.689 --> 00:10:58.524 line:95%,end
<i>I think they're going to</i>
<i>be a nervous wreck,</i>

00:10:58.591 --> 00:11:00.526 line:95%,end
<i>and I just hope</i>
<i>their mothers are frightened</i>

00:11:00.593 --> 00:11:02.328 line:95%,end
<i>and nervous and keep</i>
<i>their mouths closed.</i>

00:11:02.395 --> 00:11:04.230 line:95%,end
You're going in front of people

00:11:04.296 --> 00:11:06.132 line:95%,end
that have had great careers.

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:09.568 line:95%,end
You don't want to walk in there
and be the big joke

00:11:09.635 --> 00:11:11.837 line:95%,end
that they're going to laugh
at when they go home tonight.

00:11:11.904 --> 00:11:13.673 line:95%,end
HOLLY: <i>Everyone feels on edge.</i>

00:11:13.739 --> 00:11:15.374 line:95%,end
<i>We have this audition coming up</i>

00:11:15.441 --> 00:11:19.011 line:5%,start
and the girls do not have
a lot of ballet background.

00:11:19.078 --> 00:11:21.313 line:95%,end
<i>There's more pressure</i>
<i>than normal this week.</i>

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:24.383 line:95%,end
ABBY: And where do you think
an arabesque should be?

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:26.185 line:95%,end
Down here where yours is?

00:11:27.019 --> 00:11:27.920 line:95%,end
No.

00:11:27.987 --> 00:11:29.955 line:95%,end
At least parallel to the floor.

00:11:30.656 --> 00:11:33.459 line:95%,end
And you can't do
a crash course on this.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:37.630 line:95%,end
No, we're not fitting all of our ballet
training in for the past two years

00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:39.398 line:95%,end
in this hour class.

00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:41.534 line:95%,end
ABBY:
How did that look?

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:42.635 line:95%,end
-Better?
-MOMS: Uh-hmm.

00:11:43.235 --> 00:11:44.203 line:95%,end
Keep going.

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:45.771 line:95%,end
This has to stop.

00:11:46.238 --> 00:11:47.339 line:95%,end
But it keeps falling down.

00:11:47.406 --> 00:11:50.242 line:95%,end
I know, but that's why you wear
a leotard that fits you correctly.

00:11:50.309 --> 00:11:53.579 line:95%,end
Abby, is it possible
that, um, you could give us

00:11:53.646 --> 00:11:57.049 line:95%,end
some ideas when we go to look
for the appropriate black leotard

00:11:57.116 --> 00:11:59.418 line:95%,end
if there are certain types
of leotards we should be looking for

00:11:59.485 --> 00:12:01.220 line:95%,end
that complement
each of their body styles?

00:12:01.287 --> 00:12:02.555 line:95%,end
Not saying
that we can find them,

00:12:02.621 --> 00:12:03.989 line:95%,end
but we might stand
a better chance.

00:12:04.056 --> 00:12:06.525 line:95%,end
You want your legs
to look long and your body--

00:12:06.592 --> 00:12:08.728 line:95%,end
your torso to look short.

00:12:08.794 --> 00:12:10.596 line:95%,end
This is a cute outfit
and she's wearing it

00:12:10.663 --> 00:12:12.164 line:95%,end
and it's not giving her
a problem.

00:12:12.231 --> 00:12:15.668 line:95%,end
However, this would be
more appropriate.

00:12:15.735 --> 00:12:16.736 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Wow, yeah.

00:12:16.802 --> 00:12:17.837 line:95%,end
ABBY:
Even from the side.

00:12:17.903 --> 00:12:18.871 line:95%,end
HOLLY:
I'll be honest with you.

00:12:18.938 --> 00:12:22.742 line:95%,end
I'm not really sure what
a New York City look is for a dancer,

00:12:22.808 --> 00:12:25.745 line:95%,end
<i>so if she has this vision,</i>
<i>it's her responsibility</i>

00:12:25.811 --> 00:12:27.079 line:95%,end
<i>to communicate that</i>

00:12:27.146 --> 00:12:29.248 line:95%,end
because otherwise
we can't prepare them

00:12:29.315 --> 00:12:31.550 line:95%,end
for what she has in mind.

00:12:31.617 --> 00:12:36.222 line:95%,end
All this stuff
is really taking away

00:12:36.288 --> 00:12:40.126 line:95%,end
from her dancing,
and it's all about selling that outfit.

00:12:40.192 --> 00:12:43.229 line:95%,end
All of you stop
with these crazy outfits.

00:12:45.131 --> 00:12:47.733 line:95%,end
(whimsical music playing)

00:12:48.267 --> 00:12:50.069 line:95%,end
MELISSA:
Ooh, I'm so excited!

00:12:50.703 --> 00:12:52.738 line:95%,end
I wonder if this is
a flagship store.

00:12:52.805 --> 00:12:55.341 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>If we can find</i>
<i>a way to quiet Abby down,</i>

00:12:55.407 --> 00:12:56.242 line:5%,start
let's do it.

00:12:56.308 --> 00:12:57.610 line:5%,start
Let's go shopping
for black leotards

00:12:57.676 --> 00:12:59.111 line:5%,start
so tomorrow
we don't have to hear it.

00:12:59.178 --> 00:13:03.849 line:95%,end
We're looking for black leos
that have really high cuts for kids.

00:13:03.916 --> 00:13:06.252 line:95%,end
<i>Now I'm feeling</i>
<i>a little pressured, overwhelmed.</i>

00:13:06.318 --> 00:13:08.354 line:95%,end
<i>Abby wants us</i>
<i>to get special leotards</i>

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:10.656 line:5%,start
and we don't have any time
in the day to do so.

00:13:10.723 --> 00:13:11.857 line:95%,end
WOMAN: That's too basic?

00:13:11.924 --> 00:13:14.460 line:95%,end
-She wants something a little more--
-Well, just prettier.

00:13:14.527 --> 00:13:17.596 line:95%,end
We didn't know we were supposed
to bring 900 black leotards.

00:13:17.663 --> 00:13:18.731 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I brought two.

00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:20.633 line:95%,end
She's so particular
about what fits

00:13:20.699 --> 00:13:22.468 line:95%,end
and what doesn't and the color.

00:13:22.535 --> 00:13:25.404 line:95%,end
Do you think those leotards
are going to satisfy Abby?

00:13:25.471 --> 00:13:26.906 line:95%,end
CHRISTI:
<i>The shopping trip went well.</i>

00:13:26.972 --> 00:13:28.908 line:95%,end
<i>We were able to each find</i>
<i>a leotard for the girls.</i>


00:13:28.974 --> 00:13:29.875 line:95%,end
<i>They were solid.</i>

00:13:29.942 --> 00:13:31.677 line:95%,end
We got our pink tights
and our ballet slippers

00:13:31.744 --> 00:13:34.079 line:95%,end
so hopefully mom's
the word tomorrow.

00:13:34.146 --> 00:13:36.382 line:95%,end
You know, she's so specific
about what a leotard

00:13:36.448 --> 00:13:37.449 line:95%,end
can do for your body.

00:13:37.516 --> 00:13:39.819 line:95%,end
Maybe we ought to ask
if they have one in her size.

00:13:39.885 --> 00:13:42.221 line:95%,end
Oh, they don't make
leotards that size.

00:13:42.288 --> 00:13:44.690 line:95%,end
(laughter)

00:13:46.926 --> 00:13:50.129 line:5%,start
Everybody who dances
for Candy Apples

00:13:50.196 --> 00:13:52.932 line:95%,end
knows that they have
a certain aura about them

00:13:52.998 --> 00:13:54.967 line:95%,end
when they walk into a competition.

00:13:55.034 --> 00:13:57.837 line:5%,start
Based on everything
that I've done with Kendall,

00:13:57.903 --> 00:14:00.773 line:95%,end
I think that
she is completely ready

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.909 line:95%,end
to go up against
some of Abby's dancers

00:14:03.976 --> 00:14:07.346 line:95%,end
and audition
for a scholarship to Joffrey.

00:14:07.413 --> 00:14:11.917 line:95%,end
You know I'm down
a spectacular dancer.

00:14:13.052 --> 00:14:15.020 line:95%,end
I broke my ankle.

00:14:15.087 --> 00:14:17.423 line:95%,end
I put a lot
of stock in Taylor

00:14:17.489 --> 00:14:20.025 line:95%,end
and I don't want to pressure you
by any means

00:14:20.092 --> 00:14:22.728 line:95%,end
other than to say
she's got big shoes to fill.

00:14:23.262 --> 00:14:27.099 line:5%,start
I'm really nervous to do my solos
in front of ballet judges

00:14:27.166 --> 00:14:30.236 line:95%,end
because I'm used to doing it
in front of audiences

00:14:30.302 --> 00:14:34.206 line:95%,end
and not just being
in a room with judges.

00:14:34.273 --> 00:14:36.442 line:95%,end
CATHY: You have
to rise to the occasion.

00:14:36.508 --> 00:14:38.711 line:95%,end
You know,
cream rises to the top.

00:14:38.777 --> 00:14:41.213 line:95%,end
So we want to have
ourselves a latte.

00:14:42.314 --> 00:14:45.251 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:14:46.051 --> 00:14:48.754 line:5%,start
When you step forward,
right away your heads forward.

00:14:48.821 --> 00:14:50.222 line:5%,start
Boom, boom, bap.

00:14:50.289 --> 00:14:52.591 line:5%,start
CHLOE: <i>I am so excited</i>
<i>for my solo this week.</i>

00:14:52.658 --> 00:14:55.227 line:5%,start
<i>I'm finally the Red Queen</i>
<i>from </i>Alice in Wonderland,

00:14:55.294 --> 00:14:57.897 line:5%,start
and I've been waiting
for this forever.

00:14:57.963 --> 00:14:59.665 line:95%,end
Take your hands
right here and go.

00:15:01.333 --> 00:15:02.635 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>Chloe is doing</i>
Queen of Hearts.

00:15:02.701 --> 00:15:05.905 line:95%,end
<i>She really relates to the darkness,</i>

00:15:06.705 --> 00:15:08.007 line:95%,end
<i>to the viciousness,</i>

00:15:08.073 --> 00:15:10.142 line:95%,end
<i>to the evil aspect</i>

00:15:10.209 --> 00:15:13.078 line:95%,end
<i>of playing a character</i>

00:15:13.145 --> 00:15:14.013 line:95%,end
that is on the dark side.

00:15:14.079 --> 00:15:17.549 line:95%,end
And when you lunge,
your head's here.

00:15:17.616 --> 00:15:19.084 line:95%,end
Push through.
Look at it.

00:15:19.151 --> 00:15:20.286 line:95%,end
Change your head around.

00:15:20.352 --> 00:15:22.821 line:95%,end
<i>You know, when you tell</i>
<i>a kid to be happy and smile,</i>

00:15:22.888 --> 00:15:23.856 line:95%,end
<i>that's easy.</i>

00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:26.158 line:95%,end
But when you tell them
that they have to be evil

00:15:26.225 --> 00:15:27.826 line:95%,end
<i>and they have to be insightful</i>

00:15:27.893 --> 00:15:30.663 line:95%,end
<i>and they have to be</i>
<i>attacking the judges,</i>

00:15:30.729 --> 00:15:32.631 line:95%,end
<i>it gives them more to work with.</i>

00:15:33.232 --> 00:15:35.401 line:95%,end
<i>It gives them</i>
<i>a story line to follow.</i>

00:15:36.135 --> 00:15:38.203 line:95%,end
And that's where Chloe shines.

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:39.338 line:95%,end
Come on, Maddie.

00:15:40.339 --> 00:15:43.442 line:95%,end
So Maddie, it's called
"In My Heart."

00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:45.811 line:5%,start
We have one day to learn it

00:15:45.878 --> 00:15:48.147 line:5%,start
because tomorrow
is the big Joffrey Ballet audition.

00:15:48.213 --> 00:15:50.582 line:5%,start
MADDIE: My solo this week
is a lyrical routine,

00:15:50.649 --> 00:15:52.017 line:5%,start
and it's called "In My Heart,"

00:15:52.084 --> 00:15:55.054 line:5%,start
and I really love the song
and the choreography.

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.388 line:95%,end
Low. Hold.

00:15:56.789 --> 00:15:58.190 line:95%,end
(makes sound)

00:15:58.257 --> 00:16:00.225 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>This is a stellar routine for her.</i>

00:16:00.292 --> 00:16:02.728 line:95%,end
<i>It has all the elements</i>
<i>that she needs.</i>

00:16:02.795 --> 00:16:04.163 line:95%,end
<i>She jumps. She turns.</i>

00:16:04.229 --> 00:16:07.199 line:95%,end
<i>Her transitions are lovely.</i>

00:16:07.266 --> 00:16:11.036 line:95%,end
It certainly is a routine
that's right up Maddie's ally.

00:16:11.103 --> 00:16:13.138 line:95%,end
That, and go right
into that from there.

00:16:15.307 --> 00:16:16.809 line:95%,end
One, two.

00:16:17.943 --> 00:16:19.144 line:95%,end
MELISSA: It's not like... perfect.

00:16:19.211 --> 00:16:20.913 line:95%,end
ABBY: And you can illusion and tilt.

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.848 line:95%,end
<i>The pressure is on.</i>

00:16:22.915 --> 00:16:26.185 line:95%,end
I expect Maddie
to do really well this weekend.

00:16:26.885 --> 00:16:28.520 line:95%,end
It's hard to get to the top
of the pyramid,

00:16:28.587 --> 00:16:29.655 line:95%,end
but it's even...

00:16:29.722 --> 00:16:31.991 line:95%,end
-Harder to stay there?
-Harder to stay there.

00:16:32.057 --> 00:16:33.559 line:95%,end
So game on.


00:16:38.397 --> 00:16:41.200 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:16:41.266 --> 00:16:42.768 line:5%,start
ABBY: Girls, come on.

00:16:42.835 --> 00:16:43.802 line:5%,start
Listen up.

00:16:43.869 --> 00:16:48.607 line:5%,start
We have two days
until you are in Paramus, New Jersey

00:16:48.674 --> 00:16:50.676 line:5%,start
doing this competition in Starbound.

00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:54.880 line:5%,start
I really need my girls
to turn it on and turn it up.

00:16:54.947 --> 00:16:57.783 line:95%,end
<i>Our group number has not placed</i>
<i>in the top for weeks</i>

00:16:57.850 --> 00:16:59.151 line:95%,end
<i>and I'm sick of it.</i>

00:16:59.218 --> 00:17:01.453 line:95%,end
<i>We have a few more</i>
<i>hours to rehearse</i>

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:04.289 line:95%,end
and they better get this perfect.

00:17:04.356 --> 00:17:07.226 line:95%,end
Go get your dance bags,
put your jazz shoes on.

00:17:07.292 --> 00:17:10.295 line:95%,end
(sighs) (bleep).
We don't even have a dance bag.

00:17:12.998 --> 00:17:14.800 line:95%,end
Go tell Miss Abby
that you and Mackenzie

00:17:14.867 --> 00:17:16.068 line:95%,end
-left them on the couch.
-I don't have my shoes.

00:17:16.135 --> 00:17:17.069 line:95%,end
Don't start crying.

00:17:17.136 --> 00:17:19.872 line:95%,end
I'm not in the mood today
for any of this at all.

00:17:20.639 --> 00:17:22.007 line:95%,end
So don't get upset about it.

00:17:22.074 --> 00:17:23.308 line:95%,end
I don't care.

00:17:23.375 --> 00:17:25.811 line:95%,end
ABBY: Girls, let's go.

00:17:25.878 --> 00:17:28.047 line:95%,end
-Come on.
-Her dance bags are at the hotel.

00:17:31.183 --> 00:17:33.852 line:95%,end
Every kid makes a mistake,
Maddie, okay?

00:17:33.919 --> 00:17:35.020 line:95%,end
You're not perfect.

00:17:35.087 --> 00:17:36.422 line:95%,end
<i>Maddie was really upset</i>
<i>because she left</i>

00:17:36.488 --> 00:17:38.991 line:95%,end
<i>her dance bag at the hotel.</i>

00:17:39.058 --> 00:17:41.060 line:5%,start
That's her dance bag.
I mean, that's her shoes.

00:17:41.126 --> 00:17:45.164 line:5%,start
So she was very upset
and she wasn't herself the whole day.

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:47.132 line:95%,end
It was my fault.
Totally my fault.

00:17:47.199 --> 00:17:49.101 line:95%,end
It's not your fault.
It's her dance bag.

00:17:49.168 --> 00:17:51.036 line:95%,end
Well, every kid
makes a mistake, Abby.

00:17:51.103 --> 00:17:53.672 line:95%,end
-And you know, so it's my fault.
-Well...

00:17:53.739 --> 00:17:55.808 line:95%,end
-MELISSA: I should have checked.
-...I don't want Maddie to make mistakes.

00:17:55.874 --> 00:17:57.676 line:95%,end
-And when you get here--
-No one's perfect.

00:17:57.743 --> 00:18:00.179 line:95%,end
There's kids that are living here
that are 14 and 15 years old

00:18:00.245 --> 00:18:01.747 line:95%,end
on their own
paying their own bills.

00:18:01.814 --> 00:18:04.616 line:95%,end
And when you guys get here,
you can't call mommy.

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:08.220 line:95%,end
When you walk into an audition,
it's your responsibility,

00:18:08.287 --> 00:18:09.555 line:95%,end
not your mother's.

00:18:09.621 --> 00:18:10.756 line:95%,end
It's a pair of shoes.

00:18:10.823 --> 00:18:11.857 line:95%,end
Who cares?

00:18:12.825 --> 00:18:15.627 line:95%,end
MELISSA: <i>Maddie's on the top</i>

00:18:15.694 --> 00:18:17.896 line:95%,end
<i>and Abby puts a lot of pressure on her.</i>

00:18:17.963 --> 00:18:21.967 line:95%,end
Maddie is such a perfectionist
and she's hard on herself.

00:18:22.034 --> 00:18:25.003 line:95%,end
Maddie, stop with this face
because I'm not in the mood.

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:28.073 line:95%,end

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:31.143 line:95%,end

<i>don't flip out and stress her out.</i>

It's a couple
of $14.99 ballet slippers.

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.822 line:95%,end
Like run down the street
and get her a new pair.

ABBY: Your kid is in there,

00:18:45.257 --> 00:18:48.160 line:95%,end
and her brain is not in her head
because in the back of her head

00:18:48.227 --> 00:18:49.895 line:95%,end
she's thinking about,
where's my bag?

00:18:49.962 --> 00:18:51.063 line:95%,end
What if I lost my shoes?

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:52.097 line:95%,end

Mackenzie and Maddie

ABBY: Now, what are we going to do?

00:19:02.241 --> 00:19:05.511 line:95%,end
The more your kid is on the ball,
the more people expect.

00:19:05.577 --> 00:19:07.312 line:95%,end
And that's sad,
but that's the truth.

00:19:07.379 --> 00:19:09.548 line:95%,end
<i>We just don't have time</i>
<i>for mistakes like this.</i>

00:19:09.615 --> 00:19:12.417 line:95%,end

<i>that we just don't have.</i>

00:19:13.785 --> 00:19:17.489 line:95%,end
If the group loses again
this week, I'm finished.

00:19:17.556 --> 00:19:21.960 line:95%,end
I need you to be nasty

You're playing a part.

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:26.365 line:95%,end
Line. I want to set those points.

<i>scary to think about.</i>

00:19:31.103 --> 00:19:33.772 line:95%,end
<i>I think you just have</i>

00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:37.409 line:5%,start

You're not hitting that.

hard for them

00:20:18.784 --> 00:20:20.018 line:95%,end
This is a big deal.

00:20:20.085 --> 00:20:23.956 line:95%,end

the children are

I'm not expecting Nia to win it.

00:20:57.556 --> 00:20:59.758 line:95%,end
It's just a hard balance,
I think, as a mom

00:20:59.825 --> 00:21:01.994 line:95%,end

your daughter

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:04.529 line:95%,end
to go out and do well
but also temper that

00:21:04.596 --> 00:21:06.665 line:95%,end

her hopes up too high.

00:21:06.732 --> 00:21:08.533 line:5%,start
I don't expect Nia to win,

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.502 line:5%,start

for my daughter

00:21:10.569 --> 00:21:11.970 line:95%,end

something to her.

00:21:12.638 --> 00:21:14.339 line:95%,end

what exactly happened
to these dance bags?

Mom, do you have my dance bag?

00:21:23.081 --> 00:21:24.483 line:95%,end
I think we should
steal the bags.

(laughter)

00:21:25.851 --> 00:21:27.953 line:95%,end

their bags so they get in trouble.

get in trouble for anything.

the Zielgers' dance bags?

Yeah, Christi probably
has it up in her room.

00:21:35.927 --> 00:21:36.928 line:95%,end
Maybe.

really could make or break

MADDIE: I think going up against Chloe
is going to be hard

00:27:19.037 --> 00:27:21.640 line:5%,start
because she's more of a ballerina
than I am.

00:27:21.706 --> 00:27:22.974 line:95%,end
ABBY: Shoulders down.

00:27:23.041 --> 00:27:25.243 line:95%,end
Shoulders back the whole time. No pouch.

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:26.778 line:95%,end
MADDIE: <i>I'm really nervous</i>

00:27:26.845 --> 00:27:28.813 line:95%,end
because we don't really do
ballet that often

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.649 line:95%,end
and we have three ballet judges.

00:27:31.616 --> 00:27:33.885 line:95%,end
JUDGE: So, Maddie, you got something
you can show us?

00:27:33.952 --> 00:27:35.186 line:95%,end
-Yes.
-JUDGE: All right.

00:27:35.253 --> 00:27:38.256 line:95%,end
(mellow music playing)

00:28:06.284 --> 00:28:07.419 line:95%,end
JUDGE: Thank you.

00:28:07.485 --> 00:28:08.620 line:95%,end
You really know how to perform.

00:28:08.687 --> 00:28:09.788 line:95%,end
Thank you.

00:28:09.854 --> 00:28:11.222 line:95%,end
JUDGE: Some showmanship going on there.

00:28:11.289 --> 00:28:12.891 line:95%,end
You could have been on Broadway.

00:28:12.957 --> 00:28:15.927 line:95%,end
But you have to be a dancer.

00:28:15.994 --> 00:28:19.431 line:95%,end
Throughout the whole piece
I kept wanting there to be a pause.

00:28:19.998 --> 00:28:24.602 line:95%,end
I wanted there to be a time
where you let your body finish

00:28:24.669 --> 00:28:27.472 line:95%,end
and move all the way through something

00:28:27.539 --> 00:28:30.275 line:95%,end
before jumping into the next movement.

00:28:30.341 --> 00:28:32.777 line:95%,end
JUDGE: Uh, can you go up on releve.

00:28:32.844 --> 00:28:34.012 line:95%,end
Show me releve, right?

00:28:34.079 --> 00:28:36.815 line:95%,end
Go really high up on the releve, okay?

00:28:36.881 --> 00:28:38.750 line:95%,end
Those feet have more potential

00:28:38.817 --> 00:28:40.452 line:95%,end
than what you're using right now.

00:28:40.518 --> 00:28:42.353 line:95%,end
But you've got to work hard to do it.

00:28:47.425 --> 00:28:49.260 line:95%,end
They said that I have great potential.

00:28:49.327 --> 00:28:52.330 line:5%,start
ABBY: Maddie came out,
and Maddie was not all that confident.

00:28:52.397 --> 00:28:56.668 line:95%,end
<i>She takes things very seriously</i>
<i>and very much to heart.</i>

00:28:56.735 --> 00:28:59.637 line:95%,end
Two and three, four and five.

00:28:59.704 --> 00:29:01.039 line:95%,end
Legs at six.

00:29:01.106 --> 00:29:05.443 line:95%,end
We all know that Kendall
has had training other places

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:08.146 line:95%,end
so we've just kind of tweaked out
all the bad habits

00:29:08.213 --> 00:29:10.448 line:95%,end
that she's gathered along the way.

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:15.220 line:95%,end
Cathy's gotten Kendall
so many things going on.

00:29:15.286 --> 00:29:16.121 line:95%,end
That's wonderful.

00:29:16.187 --> 00:29:18.957 line:95%,end
CATHY: How have the moms been
at Candy Apples, Jill?

00:29:19.023 --> 00:29:19.958 line:95%,end
JILL: The moms are great.

00:29:20.024 --> 00:29:22.761 line:95%,end
CATHY: That's probably why
I have 300 students versus 20

00:29:22.827 --> 00:29:26.131 line:95%,end
because I don't have a problem
with embracing new customers.

00:29:26.197 --> 00:29:29.000 line:95%,end
ABBY: Cathy, how many kids
have you had here at Joffrey?

00:29:29.067 --> 00:29:31.336 line:95%,end
-CATHY: How many have you had, Abby?
-Three.

00:29:31.402 --> 00:29:33.238 line:95%,end
CATHY: I highly doubt
that you've had three people here.

00:29:33.304 --> 00:29:36.241 line:95%,end
I've had students study here
in the summer every single year,

00:29:36.307 --> 00:29:37.876 line:95%,end
and I'm not going to start
to name them off

00:29:37.942 --> 00:29:39.144 line:95%,end
because it means nothing to you.

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:44.215 line:95%,end
I honestly feel
that the Abby Lee Miller gang

00:29:44.282 --> 00:29:47.118 line:95%,end
think that they've bought the market

00:29:47.185 --> 00:29:49.954 line:95%,end
on any competition,

00:29:50.021 --> 00:29:52.056 line:95%,end
any audition,

00:29:52.123 --> 00:29:53.958 line:95%,end
anything that has to do with dance.

00:29:54.025 --> 00:29:56.528 line:95%,end
<i>They are nothing but trouble,</i>

00:29:56.594 --> 00:30:00.565 line:95%,end
<i>and it was honestly fun</i>
<i>just to get Abby's feathers ruffled.</i>

00:30:00.632 --> 00:30:01.800 line:95%,end
JUDGE: Good afternoon, everyone.

00:30:01.866 --> 00:30:04.102 line:95%,end
We are ready for the dancers.

00:30:06.604 --> 00:30:10.575 line:5%,start
All right, now, if I could get
to number 247 over here, please.

00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:16.281 line:95%,end
Fifth position, tendu, and close.

00:30:16.347 --> 00:30:18.783 line:95%,end
Tendu, and close.

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:22.020 line:95%,end
CATHY: See, number 250
was plopping your foot out

00:30:22.086 --> 00:30:23.021 line:95%,end
and bringing it back up.

00:30:23.087 --> 00:30:25.456 line:95%,end
Oh, so sorry, that's your child.

00:30:26.558 --> 00:30:27.425 line:95%,end
KELLY: Cathy.

00:30:27.492 --> 00:30:28.927 line:95%,end
Cathy. Is that all you guys can say?

00:30:28.993 --> 00:30:30.061 line:95%,end
You're not even supposed to be watching.

00:30:30.128 --> 00:30:31.362 line:95%,end
Aren't you the teacher?
Shouldn't you know that?

00:30:31.429 --> 00:30:32.630 line:95%,end
Well then stop popping your head in.

00:30:32.697 --> 00:30:33.531 line:95%,end
-I didn't.
-CATHY: What?

00:30:33.598 --> 00:30:34.766 line:95%,end
KELLY: I just turned around
and looked for you.

00:30:34.833 --> 00:30:36.901 line:95%,end
CATHY: I don't see a sign
that says no teachers allowed.

00:30:36.968 --> 00:30:38.436 line:95%,end
-KELLY: It's just etiquette.
-No, no, no.

00:30:38.503 --> 00:30:39.838 line:95%,end
-You don't look in...
-You know what?

00:30:39.904 --> 00:30:41.339 line:95%,end
-...on an audition.
-CATHY: Listen.

00:30:41.406 --> 00:30:43.074 line:95%,end
KELLY: Or let alone a dance class.

00:30:43.141 --> 00:30:45.009 line:95%,end
JUDGE: Take some of that tension
out of the shoulders there.

00:30:45.076 --> 00:30:46.711 line:95%,end
Lift up through the back of that neck.

00:30:46.778 --> 00:30:47.912 line:95%,end
Pull the stomach in. Good.

00:30:48.746 --> 00:30:50.415 line:95%,end
Work through that foot each time.

00:30:51.883 --> 00:30:53.818 line:95%,end
What's up with the bobby pin in your hair?

00:30:53.885 --> 00:30:54.719 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Cathy.

00:30:54.786 --> 00:30:55.954 line:95%,end
CATHY: Are you going to use them
for later?

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:56.855 line:95%,end
Yep.

00:30:56.921 --> 00:30:59.624 line:95%,end
CATHY: Honey, you so want
to have style and you don't.

00:30:59.691 --> 00:31:01.993 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Oh, Cathy, I suggest
you shut your mouth and walk away.

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:03.194 line:95%,end
CATHY: Oh, why?
Are you going to beat me up?

00:31:03.261 --> 00:31:06.698 line:95%,end
Cathy comes in and she talks
about my manners and my etiquette

00:31:06.764 --> 00:31:09.567 line:95%,end
<i>and she cannot conduct herself</i>
<i>like a human being.</i>

00:31:09.634 --> 00:31:11.102 line:95%,end
And I'm trying to sit there
and ignore her,

00:31:11.169 --> 00:31:13.805 line:95%,end
but my god, it's like needles
on a chalkboard.

00:31:13.872 --> 00:31:15.406 line:95%,end
Finally, I'm just like, ah.

00:31:15.473 --> 00:31:16.407 line:95%,end
You don't even know me.

00:31:16.474 --> 00:31:17.542 line:95%,end
I can read you like a book.

00:31:17.609 --> 00:31:19.878 line:95%,end
You are so full of (bleep).
Please be gone.

00:31:19.944 --> 00:31:21.813 line:95%,end
-CATHY: Ooh, nice language.
-I know. I got it from you.

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:23.281 line:95%,end
CATHY: That's what you always have to--
no, you didn't.

00:31:23.348 --> 00:31:25.683 line:95%,end
Christi is being her usual self.

00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:29.954 line:95%,end
She's jawing about something
that's not suiting her fancy.

00:31:30.021 --> 00:31:31.522 line:95%,end
Up and over to the bar.

00:31:31.589 --> 00:31:32.891 line:95%,end
Lengthen up out of that side.

00:31:32.957 --> 00:31:34.025 line:95%,end
Keep those stomachs strong.

00:31:34.092 --> 00:31:36.261 line:95%,end
ABBY: Cathy, let's tone it down a notch.

00:31:36.327 --> 00:31:37.528 line:95%,end
You're at the Joffrey Ballet.

00:31:37.595 --> 00:31:38.930 line:95%,end
A little decorum please.

00:31:38.997 --> 00:31:44.168 line:95%,end
CATHY: And we've got Abby
who's screaming, "Be quiet,"

00:31:44.235 --> 00:31:46.905 line:95%,end
yet it's her voice that you hear.

00:31:46.971 --> 00:31:48.473 line:95%,end
Newsflash. Newsflash.

00:31:48.539 --> 00:31:51.209 line:95%,end
There's an audition going on
right behind the door. Shush.

00:31:51.276 --> 00:31:53.111 line:95%,end
CATHY: I'm not the one that's always drunk

00:31:53.177 --> 00:31:54.479 line:95%,end
and can't take care of my kids.

00:31:54.545 --> 00:31:56.214 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I'm not drunk,
and I can take care of anybody just fine.

00:31:56.281 --> 00:31:57.715 line:95%,end
CATHY: Oh, but you've always got
a drink in your hand.

00:31:57.782 --> 00:31:59.684 line:95%,end
You embarrass yourself
every time you open your mouth.

00:31:59.751 --> 00:32:01.719 line:95%,end
Pardon me one moment, please.

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:03.688 line:95%,end
Ladies.

00:32:03.755 --> 00:32:05.089 line:95%,end

Pardon me one moment, please.

Ladies...

If you don't respect me

Please.

CHRISTI: <i>I was beyond mortified,</i>

00:32:34.686 --> 00:32:38.022 line:95%,end
<i>and I was just so mad</i>
<i>that I let Cathy get the best of me</i>

00:32:38.089 --> 00:32:41.592 line:5%,start
and I behaved that way
because I had no intentions of that.

00:32:41.659 --> 00:32:45.296 line:95%,end
I don't want anyone
to ever execute behavior

00:32:45.363 --> 00:32:47.665 line:95%,end
like what I had to step out that door

00:32:47.732 --> 00:32:50.969 line:95%,end
and tell the people
who are responsible for you

00:32:51.035 --> 00:32:52.370 line:95%,end
to not behave like.

She's loud, she's obnoxious,

00:32:58.943 --> 00:33:01.479 line:5%,start
and I don't want to be around her anymore.

Don't let a bad influence
like that influence your lives.

It was so rude.
I hope they don't embarrass me again.

thank you all for coming in.

00:33:11.923 --> 00:33:14.025 line:95%,end

Thank you.

Somebody is going to say something nice

Good, good, good.
I'll come back and check in.

00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:45.790 line:95%,end

Okay, girls, listen to me closely.

You know we're in New Jersey.

We're at Starbound.

00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:03.741 line:95%,end
You are the national champions.

00:34:03.808 --> 00:34:07.445 line:95%,end
But I'll tell you what,
a lot of these really talented studios

00:34:07.512 --> 00:34:10.915 line:95%,end
were not at the nationals in Lake Tahoe,

00:34:10.982 --> 00:34:13.451 line:95%,end

ABBY: Open that attitude up.

Your foot should be parallel

so I can take a little peek at it?

00:44:07.878 --> 00:44:11.115 line:95%,end
My thought is maybe you might want
to put that costume on

00:44:11.181 --> 00:44:13.317 line:95%,end
because you're feeling
that it's a little constricting

00:44:13.384 --> 00:44:14.785 line:95%,end
and try doing the dancing.

00:44:14.852 --> 00:44:16.887 line:5%,start
I love the solo, "Queens of Hearts,"

I think that Melissa and Abby

both put way too much
pressure on that kid.

She's nine years old.

00:50:19.583 --> 00:50:22.419 line:95%,end
Every single week she has a solo,

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:31.428 line:95%,end

MELISSA: Tell her how it feels, Chloe.
You did it too.

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:11.862 line:95%,end
And I just feel so bad

00:52:11.928 --> 00:52:13.763 line:95%,end
because I know exactly how it feels.

-MELISSA: You have to stop this, okay?

Dance isn't that important, Maddie.

00:52:23.607 --> 00:52:24.641 line:95%,end
MADDIE: Yes it is.

00:52:24.708 --> 00:52:26.243 line:95%,end
MELISSA:
But it's not your whole life.

00:52:26.309 --> 00:52:28.178 line:95%,end
Well, it is your whole life
and it shouldn't be.

00:52:28.712 --> 00:52:30.814 line:95%,end
This is way too much pressure.

<i>Not at all.</i>

00:52:38.855 --> 00:52:40.423 line:95%,end
And she kept saying,
"Abby's going to hate me,

00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:43.260 line:95%,end
she's going to hate me,"
and it really breaks your heart.

00:52:43.326 --> 00:52:44.794 line:95%,end
Abby's not going to hate you, Maddie.

00:52:44.861 --> 00:52:47.397 line:95%,end
I didn't even hear them
announce my daughter.

00:52:48.732 --> 00:52:49.833 line:95%,end
ABBY:
That doesn't matter.

00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:51.268 line:95%,end
But I'm just saying,
she was thrown on.

00:52:51.334 --> 00:52:52.669 line:95%,end
But I don't want to make excuses.

00:52:52.736 --> 00:52:53.770 line:95%,end

-MELISSA: No.

00:52:53.837 --> 00:52:55.305 line:95%,end

Maddie, it's not your fault, honey.

00:53:03.113 --> 00:53:04.948 line:95%,end
You were such a fabulous kid.

00:53:12.989 --> 00:53:14.891 line:95%,end
She knows what a kid you are.

00:53:16.026 --> 00:53:17.227 line:95%,end
ABBY: You know what?

00:53:17.294 --> 00:53:20.830 line:95%,end
Those kids who have perfect runs
and win everything when they're kids.

00:53:20.897 --> 00:53:22.098 line:95%,end
Where are they now?

00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:25.402 line:95%,end
They don't even dance anymore.

00:53:26.536 --> 00:53:29.706 line:95%,end
Kids that still have something
to shoot for and something to win.

00:53:30.574 --> 00:53:32.275 line:95%,end
They're the ones that are still working.

00:53:32.342 --> 00:53:35.645 line:5%,start
She screwed up just
like everybody else.

00:53:35.712 --> 00:53:36.546 line:95%,end
But you know what?

00:53:36.613 --> 00:53:40.150 line:95%,end
Maybe they won't all be vultures
and be after her all the time now.

00:53:41.384 --> 00:53:43.920 line:95%,end
Girls--nuh-uh, uh-uh,
we're not going to play that game.

00:53:44.454 --> 00:53:46.056 line:95%,end
You can see her

00:53:46.122 --> 00:53:47.023 line:95%,end
We're not going to play that game.

00:53:47.090 --> 00:53:48.425 line:95%,end
We're not playing that game.

00:53:48.491 --> 00:53:49.759 line:95%,end
HOLLY:
I'm not playing games.

00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:53.230 line:95%,end
But I also know that my child
ran off the stage.

00:53:53.697 --> 00:53:55.265 line:95%,end
I didn't see any tears from you, Abby,

00:53:55.332 --> 00:53:57.601 line:95%,end
when my kid ran off the stage, okay?

00:53:57.667 --> 00:53:58.835 line:95%,end
So point noted.

00:53:58.902 --> 00:54:00.537 line:95%,end
-It's a horrific--
-I don't care. I don't care.

00:54:01.638 --> 00:54:03.039 line:95%,end
I know you don't care,
and that's my point.

00:54:03.106 --> 00:54:04.908 line:5%,start
It's incredibly cruel

00:54:04.975 --> 00:54:08.111 line:5%,start
that there is a teacher
who's sitting there

00:54:08.178 --> 00:54:11.748 line:95%,end
<i>having a pity party for herself</i>

00:54:11.815 --> 00:54:14.551 line:95%,end
because her student
forgot a dance on stage.

00:54:14.618 --> 00:54:17.187 line:95%,end
And other students,
every other kid in that room

00:54:17.254 --> 00:54:19.022 line:95%,end
<i>has had that same experience.</i>

00:54:19.089 --> 00:54:22.459 line:95%,end
They all could have used a dance
teacher who cared about them.

00:54:22.525 --> 00:54:23.827 line:95%,end
Awards.

00:54:24.361 --> 00:54:25.262 line:95%,end
I'll take you down.

00:54:25.328 --> 00:54:27.163 line:95%,end
MELISSA:
Got to be supportive of your friends, so--

00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:28.765 line:95%,end
Any child being on stage
and forgetting their dance,

00:54:28.832 --> 00:54:30.200 line:95%,end
it's humiliating.

00:54:30.267 --> 00:54:31.167 line:95%,end
CHRISTI:
And it's happened to all of us.

00:54:31.234 --> 00:54:32.335 line:95%,end
And it's happened to everyone.

00:54:32.402 --> 00:54:33.803 line:95%,end
-But she even said to Maddie--
-HOLLY: There are pressures--

00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:35.372 line:95%,end
-She said she didn't care.
-HOLLY: (indistinct) for a reason.

00:54:35.438 --> 00:54:37.474 line:95%,end
And she didn't want any excuses.
She could care less.

00:54:37.540 --> 00:54:40.910 line:95%,end
Yeah, but there was not a tear shed
for another child in this company.

00:54:41.511 --> 00:54:42.679 line:95%,end
That's my issue.

00:54:42.746 --> 00:54:44.047 line:95%,end
These are children.

00:54:44.581 --> 00:54:46.483 line:95%,end
And you just cry for whatever reason

00:54:46.549 --> 00:54:47.584 line:95%,end
for one child and not the other.

00:54:47.651 --> 00:54:48.485 line:95%,end
They all hurt the same.

00:54:48.551 --> 00:54:50.220 line:95%,end
And the kids know.
The kids know.

00:54:50.287 --> 00:54:52.455 line:95%,end
It was so obvious and transparent.

00:54:53.890 --> 00:54:57.527 line:95%,end
I tried to deny that for many years
and give Abby excuses.

00:54:57.594 --> 00:54:59.262 line:95%,end
Just saying, that's just
the way she teaches,

00:54:59.329 --> 00:55:00.864 line:95%,end
that's just the way she is.

00:55:00.930 --> 00:55:02.699 line:95%,end
But today was like black and white.

00:55:02.766 --> 00:55:03.900 line:95%,end
No, it's not.

00:55:03.967 --> 00:55:06.369 line:95%,end
It's not the way she teaches for all.

00:55:07.337 --> 00:55:08.672 line:95%,end
There's a double standard.

00:55:08.738 --> 00:55:10.774 line:95%,end
There's a different system.

00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:12.742 line:95%,end
It is not equal.

00:55:13.209 --> 00:55:14.878 line:95%,end
Why don't you care that

00:55:14.944 --> 00:55:17.213 line:95%,end
all the other kids forgot their dances

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:18.581 line:95%,end
but you care for Maddie?

00:55:20.350 --> 00:55:22.218 line:95%,end
My kids have been with you
since they were two.

00:55:22.285 --> 00:55:24.754 line:95%,end
I've been with you for 30 years
and you didn't care

00:55:24.821 --> 00:55:27.290 line:95%,end
that Paige came off the stage
and forgot her dance.

00:55:27.791 --> 00:55:30.226 line:95%,end
She told Maddie she didn't care
if she forgot her dance either.

00:55:30.293 --> 00:55:31.261 line:95%,end
She sat there and cried.

00:55:31.328 --> 00:55:34.230 line:95%,end
HOLLY: <i>Abby, for once,</i>

00:55:34.297 --> 00:55:37.000 line:95%,end
<i>because she knew she was wrong.</i>

00:55:37.067 --> 00:55:39.269 line:95%,end
For once, some called her on something

00:55:39.336 --> 00:55:41.204 line:95%,end

00:55:41.271 --> 00:55:42.305 line:95%,end
Moms, it's awards.

00:56:48.037 --> 00:56:51.641 line:95%,end
<i>Give it up for 307,</i>
<i>"If My Friends Could See Me Now."</i>

00:56:51.708 --> 00:56:54.210 line:95%,end
(cheering and applause)

00:56:55.845 --> 00:57:00.550 line:95%,end
<i>In second place, 793,</i>
<i>"Want You Back," Julia!</i>

00:57:01.751 --> 00:57:05.722 line:95%,end
<i>Ladies and Gentlemen,</i>
<i>our top junior soloist today.</i>

00:57:09.159 --> 00:57:12.829 line:95%,end
<i>Please put your hands together</i>
<i>for number 891,</i>

00:57:12.896 --> 00:57:15.498 line:5%,start
<i>"Red Queen," Chloe.</i>

00:57:16.666 --> 00:57:19.269 line:5%,start
I'm really happy
that I got first overall solo.

00:57:19.335 --> 00:57:21.805 line:95%,end
I mean, I haven't really
won for first in a while,

00:57:21.871 --> 00:57:23.506 line:95%,end
so it feels really good.

00:57:23.573 --> 00:57:25.341 line:95%,end
PRESENTER:
Who choreographs for you?

00:57:25.408 --> 00:57:26.476 line:95%,end
Miss Abby Lee Miller.

00:57:26.543 --> 00:57:27.410 line:95%,end
CHRISTI:
<i>Given that Chloe</i>

00:57:27.477 --> 00:57:29.946 line:95%,end
<i>is at the bottom of the pyramid this week</i>
<i>for forgetting her number,</i>

00:57:30.013 --> 00:57:32.081 line:95%,end
<i>I'm so proud of her that she won.</i>

00:57:32.148 --> 00:57:33.683 line:95%,end
And Abby's nowhere to be seen.

00:57:34.984 --> 00:57:36.286 line:95%,end
Where do I go?

00:57:37.487 --> 00:57:38.922 line:95%,end
KELLY:
How come you didn't come to awards?

00:57:38.988 --> 00:57:40.056 line:95%,end
CHRISTI:
Chloe's your dancer.

00:57:40.123 --> 00:57:42.025 line:95%,end
You should have been
there to support her.

00:57:42.091 --> 00:57:44.527 line:95%,end
I think one of the things you
already told them is that

00:57:44.594 --> 00:57:46.162 line:95%,end
save it for your pillow

00:57:46.229 --> 00:57:48.231 line:95%,end
in your hotel room
or in your bedroom,

00:57:48.298 --> 00:57:50.900 line:95%,end
and you should model
that behavior for them

00:57:50.967 --> 00:57:53.837 line:95%,end
and sat in the front row,
put your game face on.

00:57:53.903 --> 00:57:55.772 line:95%,end
ABBY: Come paddle me.
Let's just get it over with quickly.

00:57:55.839 --> 00:57:57.307 line:95%,end
Please, that's a visual
I do not want to see.

00:57:57.373 --> 00:57:59.242 line:95%,end
ABBY: Paddle, paddle.
Take the paddle.

00:57:59.309 --> 00:58:01.611 line:95%,end
I'll give you my tongue lashing
'cause shame on you.

00:58:01.678 --> 00:58:03.046 line:95%,end
That's what you give the girls.

00:58:03.112 --> 00:58:05.515 line:95%,end
<i>I have nothing to say</i>
<i>to these moms right now,</i>

00:58:05.582 --> 00:58:07.016 line:95%,end
and I don't care if I hurt their feelings.

00:58:07.083 --> 00:58:09.085 line:95%,end
They're grown adults.
They can handle it.

00:58:09.152 --> 00:58:11.454 line:95%,end
If they want their kids to be nurtured
and coddled,

00:58:11.521 --> 00:58:13.423 line:95%,end
they need to take them
back to nursery school.

00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:16.392 line:95%,end
You always say like, you know,
act professional, act professional,

00:58:16.459 --> 00:58:17.927 line:95%,end
you know, grow up.

00:58:17.994 --> 00:58:20.864 line:95%,end
This isn't really professional
model behavior.

00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:25.368 line:95%,end
Unbelievable.

00:58:25.435 --> 00:58:29.439 line:95%,end
I could not just sit there
and say nothing.

00:58:29.506 --> 00:58:31.374 line:95%,end
After all my child has experienced

00:58:31.441 --> 00:58:34.277 line:95%,end
and as well as many of those
other kids, it's not right.

00:58:34.344 --> 00:58:35.512 line:95%,end
It just is not right.

00:58:36.012 --> 00:58:37.046 line:95%,end
-CHLOE: Hi.
-Hello.

00:58:37.113 --> 00:58:38.515 line:95%,end
Congratulations.
You should be proud.

00:58:38.581 --> 00:58:40.049 line:95%,end
-MELISSA: Good job, Chlo.
-Everybody here is proud of you.

00:58:40.116 --> 00:58:41.050 line:95%,end
-CHLOE: Thank you.
-GIRL: Good job, Chloe.

00:58:41.117 --> 00:58:42.385 line:95%,end
Yeah, you should be proud of yourself.

00:58:43.286 --> 00:58:45.421 line:95%,end
Abby didn't say,
"Chloe you were fabulous."

00:58:45.488 --> 00:58:48.558 line:95%,end
<i>She didn't say like, "Oh, Chloe, you know,</i>
<i>way to go, that was amazing."</i>

00:58:48.625 --> 00:58:51.127 line:95%,end
<i>Nothing. It was all about Maddie.</i>

00:58:52.595 --> 00:58:53.630 line:95%,end
It's amazing to me.

00:58:53.696 --> 00:58:55.431 line:95%,end
It's amazing.

00:58:55.498 --> 00:58:57.200 line:95%,end
But there's no favoritism.

00:58:57.967 --> 00:58:59.035 line:95%,end
Not at all.

00:59:04.207 --> 00:59:05.208 line:95%,end
ABBY:
All right, guys.

00:59:05.275 --> 00:59:06.576 line:95%,end
See on the flip side.

00:59:08.678 --> 00:59:11.514 line:95%,end
So Abby says very cryptically,
see you on the other side,

00:59:11.581 --> 00:59:12.749 line:95%,end
and leaves the door.

00:59:13.683 --> 00:59:14.951 line:95%,end
Like, what's going on?

00:59:15.018 --> 00:59:17.253 line:95%,end
And the only one in the room
who doesn't seem confused

00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:18.655 line:95%,end
is Melissa.

00:59:18.721 --> 00:59:19.556 line:95%,end
MELISSA: She's going home.

00:59:19.622 --> 00:59:20.990 line:95%,end
CHRISTI:
What do you mean she's going home?

00:59:21.057 --> 00:59:22.525 line:95%,end
MELISSA:
She's leaving right now.

00:59:25.128 --> 00:59:26.396 line:95%,end
HOLLY:
<i>Did she really leave?</i>

00:59:26.462 --> 00:59:27.564 line:95%,end
This can't be real.

00:59:27.630 --> 00:59:29.599 line:95%,end
<i>I lost a lot of respect for Abby.</i>

00:59:29.666 --> 00:59:31.401 line:95%,end
<i>I really did.</i>

00:59:31.467 --> 00:59:33.069 line:95%,end
-Hi.
-TAXI DRIVER: (indistinct)

00:59:34.270 --> 00:59:37.173 line:95%,end
It's just funny how all of a sudden
when things don't go Abby's way

00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:38.374 line:95%,end
<i>she's running home.</i>

00:59:38.441 --> 00:59:41.678 line:95%,end
<i>I think it's ridiculous you're leaving</i>
<i>because you're embarrassed</i>

00:59:41.744 --> 00:59:43.346 line:95%,end
about the way you act earlier today.

00:59:43.413 --> 00:59:44.747 line:95%,end
KELLY:
Where are you going?

00:59:44.814 --> 00:59:45.982 line:95%,end
I'm going to go to the hotel,
get my stuff,

00:59:46.049 --> 00:59:46.983 line:5%,start
and going right to the airport.

00:59:47.050 --> 00:59:48.551 line:5%,start
ABBY: <i>I need a break</i>

00:59:48.618 --> 00:59:51.020 line:5%,start
<i>I need a break from these moms,</i>
<i>a break from these kids,</i>

00:59:51.087 --> 00:59:52.121 line:5%,start
a break from the yelling.

00:59:52.188 --> 00:59:54.257 line:5%,start
What do you want us to tell the kids?

00:59:54.324 --> 00:59:56.459 line:5%,start
Your kids are fine.

00:59:56.526 --> 00:59:57.660 line:5%,start
They're great.

00:59:57.727 --> 01:00:01.531 line:5%,start
They have been trained even
as young as seven years old.

01:00:01.598 --> 01:00:02.765 line:5%,start
They know what to do.

01:00:02.832 --> 01:00:04.200 line:5%,start
And they're fine without me.

01:00:04.267 --> 01:00:06.502 line:5%,start
KELLY: <i>I have known Abby</i>
<i>for a long time</i>

01:00:06.569 --> 01:00:08.504 line:5%,start
<i>and I have never seen her like this.</i>

01:00:08.571 --> 01:00:10.406 line:5%,start
I'm shocked.

01:00:10.473 --> 01:00:13.476 line:5%,start
(dramatic music playing)
