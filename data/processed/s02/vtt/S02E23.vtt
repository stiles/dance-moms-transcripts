JILL: How long are you out for?

00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:05.572 line:5%,start
Four to six weeks.

00:00:05.638 --> 00:00:07.440 line:5%,start
It's a cruel world. (laughs)

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:09.943 line:5%,start
ABBY: I'm looking for a
replacement for the duet.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.278 line:5%,start
Why did you ask Paige
who was replacing her in the duet?

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:13.179 line:5%,start
JILL: I didn't.

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:15.615 line:5%,start
So what can we do to a quick fix?

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:18.251 line:5%,start
You're probably not going to want to hear
what I'm going to tell you to do.

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:20.420 line:5%,start
I want her to do it. She wants to do it.

00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:21.688 line:5%,start
But I don't think she can.

00:00:21.755 --> 00:00:25.692 line:5%,start
You have sabotaged my daughter
and the rest of the kids!

(bleep) There, I said it.

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:37.904 line:5%,start
We need to really work hard this week

have hopped back to Abby's studio.

<i>Your top Junior Group.</i>

00:01:44.237 --> 00:01:47.407 line:95%,end
We're on a winning streak,
and I want to keep it that way.

00:01:47.474 --> 00:01:50.844 line:95%,end
Those judges definitely know
who the Abby Lee Dance Company is.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.879 line:95%,end
I want to keep this winning streak going.

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:54.647 line:95%,end
Now, onto the pyramid.

00:01:54.714 --> 00:01:57.350 line:95%,end
Kendall, you were brought in as a guest.

00:01:57.417 --> 00:02:00.386 line:95%,end
Even though you helped
the team win first place,

00:02:00.453 --> 00:02:03.223 line:95%,end
you're still a guest at the
Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.160 line:95%,end
Jill is notorious for jumping ship
and taking Kendall with her.

00:02:07.227 --> 00:02:12.198 line:95%,end
So until they can both prove to me
that they want to be here for life,

00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:14.300 line:95%,end
I'm not putting Kendall
back on that pyramid.

00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:17.103 line:95%,end
First I have Brooke.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.738 line:95%,end
You had a rough week.

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:19.772 line:95%,end
You were injured.

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:22.275 line:95%,end
Day one, I saw the pain in your face.

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:24.477 line:95%,end
I gave you an amazing number,

00:02:24.544 --> 00:02:25.578 line:95%,end
and now you're not going to do it?

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:27.147 line:95%,end
No one's ever going to see it?

00:02:27.213 --> 00:02:28.481 line:95%,end
She can't do it.

00:02:28.548 --> 00:02:32.986 line:95%,end
You're on the bottom because you never
spoke up and said anything.

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:36.089 line:95%,end
Next, Paige.

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:38.491 line:95%,end
You're injured.
There's not much to judge you on.

00:02:38.558 --> 00:02:41.928 line:95%,end
I wanted you to work on your terminology
and do the warm up with us.

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:43.730 line:95%,end
You didn't show up for a whole day.

00:02:43.796 --> 00:02:46.799 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>My kids are on the bottom</i>
<i>of the pyramid, once again.</i>

00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:50.103 line:5%,start
But the funny thing is,
Paige has a broken foot

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.739 line:5%,start
and didn't dance, and she's above Brooke.

00:02:52.805 --> 00:02:55.475 line:95%,end
ABBY: Next, Mackenzie.

00:02:55.542 --> 00:02:57.010 line:95%,end
You had a solo.

00:02:57.076 --> 00:02:58.478 line:95%,end
I thought you did a good job.

00:02:58.545 --> 00:02:59.913 line:95%,end
I thought your solo was great.

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:03.783 line:95%,end
But crying, having a little meltdown--

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.154 line:95%,end
I don't want kids on the team
that act like brats.

00:03:08.221 --> 00:03:09.455 line:95%,end
Understood?

00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:12.158 line:95%,end
Am I disappointed in second? Absolutely.

00:03:12.225 --> 00:03:14.294 line:95%,end
But you can't do that
because it looks like

00:03:14.394 --> 00:03:16.162 line:95%,end
you're ungrateful that you were second.

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:18.531 line:95%,end
You're eight now.
You're not a baby, anymore.

00:03:18.598 --> 00:03:20.934 line:95%,end
Save your tears for the pillow.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.236 line:95%,end
Understood?

00:03:23.303 --> 00:03:25.471 line:95%,end
Next, Maddie.

00:03:25.538 --> 00:03:27.473 line:95%,end
You're probably wondering, why am I there?

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.175 line:95%,end
You were the overall high score winner.

00:03:29.242 --> 00:03:32.345 line:95%,end
It doesn't matter. You need higher goals.


00:03:32.412 --> 00:03:36.082 line:95%,end
Remember I told you I wanted you
20 points above the person?

00:03:37.116 --> 00:03:38.851 line:95%,end
6 and 1/2 is not 20.

00:03:40.086 --> 00:03:43.690 line:95%,end
All right. Next, Chloe.

00:03:43.756 --> 00:03:45.225 line:95%,end
You were outstanding in the group.

00:03:45.291 --> 00:03:47.093 line:95%,end
You did an okay job with the duet.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.462 line:95%,end
But I want you to be intense.

00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:51.864 line:95%,end
That same intensity you bring to the solo,

00:03:51.931 --> 00:03:55.068 line:95%,end
you need to bring to the group
and to the duets

00:03:55.134 --> 00:03:57.904 line:95%,end
and to the trios and to every number
that you're in.

00:03:57.971 --> 00:04:00.873 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>Every week, Abby yells at Chloe</i>
<i>that she needs more confidence.</i>

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.742 line:5%,start
Maybe if you didn't bark and scream at her

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:04.844 line:5%,start
she would have more confidence on stage.

00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:09.315 line:5%,start
-And, at the top of the pyramid, Nia.
-(applause)

00:04:09.382 --> 00:04:12.485 line:95%,end
ABBY:
Nia, you're at the top of the pyramid

00:04:12.552 --> 00:04:15.054 line:95%,end
<i>because I am so proud of you.</i>

00:04:15.121 --> 00:04:16.055 line:95%,end
<i>You did your solo.</i>

00:04:16.122 --> 00:04:17.824 line:95%,end
<i>You got a standing ovation.</i>

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.826 line:95%,end
HOLLY: <i>Being at the top</i>
<i>of the pyramid for Nia</i>

00:04:19.892 --> 00:04:21.494 line:95%,end
<i>is a long awaited dream.</i>

00:04:21.561 --> 00:04:25.832 line:5%,start
And it's not an expectation,
but it's a wonderful recognition

00:04:25.898 --> 00:04:29.802 line:95%,end
for the work and achievement that
she's been able to bring to the team.

00:04:29.869 --> 00:04:33.006 line:95%,end
ABBY: This week you are the
dance captain of the group.

00:04:33.072 --> 00:04:36.309 line:95%,end
(cheering and applause)

00:04:36.376 --> 00:04:38.711 line:95%,end
I wouldn't be so smiling.

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:41.314 line:95%,end
It's 10 times more work
than everybody else has.

00:04:41.381 --> 00:04:45.718 line:5%,start
Team captain, to me,
means that you correct your friends.

00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:48.755 line:95%,end
Even though if you don't want to,
you have to,

00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:50.957 line:95%,end
but say it in a nice way,

00:04:51.024 --> 00:04:54.327 line:95%,end
<i>and just doing everything</i>
<i>to help your teammates.</i>

00:04:54.394 --> 00:04:55.962 line:95%,end
I can get used to this.

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:59.332 line:95%,end
This weekend we're going to Starbound,

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:02.335 line:95%,end
and we will be going to Myrtle Beach...

00:05:02.402 --> 00:05:03.369 line:95%,end
(cheering)

00:05:03.436 --> 00:05:04.604 line:95%,end
...South Carolina.

00:05:04.671 --> 00:05:06.873 line:95%,end
This week we're headed to Starbound.

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:10.310 line:95%,end
And I'm thrilled because my kids
have done great at Starbound.

00:05:10.376 --> 00:05:14.347 line:95%,end
Kendall, this week you're going
to do a duet with Mackenzie.

00:05:14.414 --> 00:05:16.516 line:95%,end
Chloe, you have a solo.

00:05:16.582 --> 00:05:18.851 line:95%,end
Maddie, no solo this week.

00:05:20.453 --> 00:05:22.355 line:95%,end
Moms, you're dismissed. Go ahead upstairs.

00:05:22.422 --> 00:05:24.924 line:95%,end
Ladies, we have lots of work to do.
Let's go.

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:26.392 line:95%,end
Boom. Stomachs, tight.

00:05:27.193 --> 00:05:29.429 line:5%,start
Strong arms.
You're reaching for her, Brooke.

00:05:29.495 --> 00:05:31.197 line:5%,start
Reach out there! Boom!

00:05:31.264 --> 00:05:33.700 line:5%,start
<i>This week's group number</i>
<i>is called "Taken."</i>

00:05:33.766 --> 00:05:36.369 line:5%,start
<i>And it has to do with four little girls</i>

00:05:36.436 --> 00:05:37.970 line:95%,end
<i>who are all dressed the same,</i>

00:05:38.037 --> 00:05:40.840 line:95%,end
<i>and they're watching this</i>
<i>other little girl.</i>

00:05:40.907 --> 00:05:43.109 line:95%,end
<i>She's dressed in her own color.</i>

00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:44.143 line:95%,end
<i>She's happy.</i>

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.779 line:95%,end
And, of course, they want to be like her.

00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:49.816 line:95%,end
But they know that
that is not a possibility.

00:05:49.882 --> 00:05:51.918 line:95%,end
So what do they do?

00:05:51.984 --> 00:05:53.486 line:95%,end
They get her to be like them.

00:05:53.553 --> 00:05:54.787 line:95%,end
Don't be so far away.

00:05:54.854 --> 00:05:56.556 line:95%,end
Look at Chloe.

00:05:56.622 --> 00:05:58.758 line:95%,end
Right here! We go that way.

00:05:58.825 --> 00:06:02.228 line:95%,end
I am worried
because Abby's after a clean sweep,

00:06:02.995 --> 00:06:05.131 line:95%,end
and Chloe is doing a solo.

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:06.933 line:95%,end
She's her only soloist.

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:07.967 line:95%,end
That makes me nervous.

00:06:08.034 --> 00:06:10.136 line:95%,end
Abby really wants to stay
on this winning streak.

00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:11.671 line:95%,end
By not giving Maddie a solo,

00:06:11.738 --> 00:06:14.407 line:95%,end
she's putting an extra
amount of pressure on Chloe to win.

00:06:14.474 --> 00:06:15.742 line:95%,end
Why were you at pyramid?

00:06:15.808 --> 00:06:17.877 line:95%,end
I thought Abby said
that she was going to just call you

00:06:17.944 --> 00:06:19.312 line:95%,end
if she needed you. Did she call you?

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:21.748 line:95%,end
Well, trust me, I wouldn't have shown up

00:06:21.814 --> 00:06:23.216 line:95%,end
if she didn't tell me to.

00:06:23.282 --> 00:06:26.052 line:95%,end
<i>I don't want my daughter or myself</i>
<i>to step on anybody's toes.</i>

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:28.654 line:95%,end
<i>But Kendall deserves</i>
<i>to be a part of this team.</i>

00:06:28.721 --> 00:06:30.890 line:5%,start
Abby invited us to pyramid.

00:06:30.957 --> 00:06:33.526 line:5%,start
Here we are.
These moms need to deal with it.

00:06:33.593 --> 00:06:35.695 line:95%,end
You are one lucky little girl.

00:06:35.762 --> 00:06:38.898 line:95%,end
You get to be rehearsing
with these people who have won week

00:06:38.965 --> 00:06:40.266 line:95%,end
after week after week.

00:06:40.333 --> 00:06:43.836 line:95%,end
Every one of those bad habits
that you came to my studio with

00:06:43.903 --> 00:06:46.439 line:95%,end
got worse when you went to Cathy's.

00:06:46.506 --> 00:06:48.875 line:95%,end
Now I have to clean up the mess.
Thank you.

00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:52.445 line:95%,end
Even though I'm letting Kendall
do the group number

00:06:52.512 --> 00:06:55.615 line:95%,end
and I've selected her
for a duet with Mackenzie,

00:06:55.681 --> 00:06:59.619 line:95%,end
she is under no circumstances
a member of the team.

00:06:59.685 --> 00:07:02.655 line:95%,end
She is still a guest at the
Abby Lee Dance Company.


00:07:02.722 --> 00:07:04.791 line:95%,end
All right, girls, love to talk to you
a little bit about this number.

00:07:04.857 --> 00:07:08.528 line:95%,end
This is a very deep number,
and it's going to be difficult

00:07:08.594 --> 00:07:11.364 line:95%,end
to get across to the judges
in two minutes and 30 seconds.

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:14.667 line:95%,end
So Maddie is the one that I've chosen

00:07:14.734 --> 00:07:16.202 line:95%,end
to do her own choreography.

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:18.471 line:95%,end
You come out, you're a free spirit.

00:07:18.538 --> 00:07:19.972 line:95%,end
You have all the privileges.

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:21.574 line:95%,end
You're allowed to do anything.

00:07:21.641 --> 00:07:24.877 line:95%,end
I've chosen Maddie
to be the lead role in this piece

00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:27.680 line:95%,end
because she is perfect for the part.

00:07:27.747 --> 00:07:31.451 line:95%,end
She has the facial expressions
that can tell the judges the story.

00:07:31.517 --> 00:07:35.288 line:95%,end
You guys don't have any of those
pleasures of life that she has.

00:07:35.354 --> 00:07:39.459 line:95%,end
She's different. You're going to make her
want to be like you.

00:07:39.525 --> 00:07:41.928 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I'm pretty sure
when she was discussing the group dance,

00:07:41.994 --> 00:07:43.663 line:95%,end
there's one little girl is special

00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:44.997 line:95%,end
and they all want to make her conform--

00:07:45.064 --> 00:07:46.833 line:95%,end
like, who do you think that's going to be?

00:07:46.899 --> 00:07:50.269 line:95%,end
Apparently, Abby is using this
as an opportunity

00:07:50.336 --> 00:07:55.408 line:95%,end
to explain to the world
that our girls are a mediocre cult.

00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:58.444 line:95%,end
And if they see someone
who is better than them,

00:07:58.511 --> 00:08:00.346 line:95%,end
they're going to drag her down
to their level.

00:08:00.413 --> 00:08:03.015 line:95%,end
I mean, she's obviously using this
as a parallel to last week.

00:08:03.082 --> 00:08:04.750 line:95%,end
And I think it's very offensive.

00:08:04.817 --> 00:08:08.020 line:95%,end
But she's going to say, "It's a number.
It's too--you know, it's interpretive.

00:08:08.087 --> 00:08:10.056 line:95%,end
It's art." It's (bleep).

00:08:10.122 --> 00:08:12.291 line:95%,end
She's always talking
about how different Nia is

00:08:12.358 --> 00:08:14.093 line:95%,end
and her hair and all of this.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.761 line:95%,end
And here's a prime opportunity.

00:08:15.828 --> 00:08:17.763 line:95%,end
She could capitalize
on Nia being different,

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:19.765 line:95%,end
since that's a featured part of the dance.

00:08:19.832 --> 00:08:22.401 line:95%,end
The storyline is,
is that Maddie is above us

00:08:22.468 --> 00:08:25.872 line:95%,end
and we're trying to bring
her back to be like us.

00:08:25.938 --> 00:08:27.673 line:95%,end
MELISSA: <i>Kelly and Christi</i>
<i>are reading way too much</i>

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:28.641 line:95%,end
<i>into this group dance.</i>

00:08:28.708 --> 00:08:30.743 line:5%,start
It's like they are always
looking for something

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:32.311 line:5%,start
to argue about, all the time.

00:08:32.378 --> 00:08:34.580 line:95%,end
You can't celebrate other people.

00:08:34.647 --> 00:08:36.716 line:95%,end
But when we don't celebrate Maddie,

00:08:36.782 --> 00:08:39.051 line:95%,end
-it turns into this big thing.
-Everybody celebrates everybody.

00:08:39.118 --> 00:08:41.954 line:95%,end
Oh, okay.
That's why you talk about my daughter.

00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:43.389 line:95%,end
You talked about Chloe.

00:08:43.456 --> 00:08:45.258 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Christi is taking
Chloe out of school,

00:08:45.324 --> 00:08:46.425 line:95%,end
and then she's taking her to the movies.

00:08:48.394 --> 00:08:50.696 line:95%,end
No comment? No deflection?

00:08:50.763 --> 00:08:53.266 line:95%,end
-You talk about my daughter all the time.
-CHRISTI: No, I (bleep).

00:08:53.332 --> 00:08:56.068 line:95%,end
I talk about the way Abby favors her!

00:08:56.135 --> 00:08:58.437 line:95%,end
Have any of these women up here
heard me talk about Maddie

00:08:58.504 --> 00:09:00.039 line:95%,end
or have I talked about the favoritism?

00:09:00.106 --> 00:09:01.874 line:95%,end
My daughter is a 10-year-old little girl.

00:09:01.941 --> 00:09:05.044 line:95%,end
And when you have 40-year-old women
who will stop at nothing

00:09:05.111 --> 00:09:07.480 line:95%,end
to tear her down
because of a dance, I'm sorry,

00:09:07.547 --> 00:09:09.749 line:95%,end
I'm going to step in.
And I'm not going to take it.

00:09:09.815 --> 00:09:12.852 line:95%,end
You are a (bleep) troublemaker,
and you're a bitch!

00:09:12.919 --> 00:09:15.421 line:95%,end
I'm not the liar of the group. Sorry.

00:09:15.488 --> 00:09:17.823 line:95%,end
Just like you lied
about my daughter cheating.

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:19.959 line:95%,end
I didn't lie! You told her you cheated!

00:09:20.026 --> 00:09:21.928 line:95%,end
-I did not!
-You told her that!

00:09:21.994 --> 00:09:23.195 line:95%,end
I did not!

00:09:23.262 --> 00:09:25.298 line:95%,end
I'm not (bleep) doing this
anymore about this.

00:09:25.364 --> 00:09:27.033 line:95%,end
Who's the liar in this group?

00:09:27.099 --> 00:09:28.834 line:95%,end
-Who lies all the time? You.
-Okay. Yeah.

00:09:28.901 --> 00:09:31.003 line:95%,end
Who had an affair with her boss?

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:33.706 line:95%,end
Who is living with a man
who is still married?

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.942 line:95%,end
That's it.

00:09:36.008 --> 00:09:38.611 line:95%,end
-I did not have an affair with my boss!
-CHRISTI: Yes, you did!

00:09:38.678 --> 00:09:41.113 line:95%,end
(bleep) you. I did not (bleep) bitch!

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.482 line:95%,end
(bleep) There, I said it.

00:09:43.549 --> 00:09:44.517 line:95%,end
There's a new word.

00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:46.285 line:95%,end
We haven't used that one, yet.

00:09:46.352 --> 00:09:49.121 line:95%,end
JILL: Well, I feel--I feel badly for her

00:09:49.188 --> 00:09:51.691 line:95%,end
because she was very upset.

00:09:51.757 --> 00:09:55.828 line:95%,end
And I think she does things,
you guys, to get along.

00:09:55.895 --> 00:09:58.531 line:95%,end
<i>She wants to be on the team</i>
<i>and be a team player.</i>

00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:00.433 line:95%,end
<i>And, you know, I don't know.</i>

00:10:00.499 --> 00:10:02.134 line:95%,end
-HOLLY: All I will say--
-JILL: I don't know why she does

00:10:02.201 --> 00:10:03.336 line:95%,end
-what she does.
-All I will say is this.

00:10:03.402 --> 00:10:06.472 line:95%,end
Melissa is an incredibly smart woman.

00:10:06.539 --> 00:10:08.174 line:95%,end
So she knows exactly what she's doing...

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.342 line:95%,end
-CHRISTI: Exactly.
-JILL: ...as she does it...

00:10:09.408 --> 00:10:11.077 line:95%,end
-CHRISTI: Yes.
-JILL: ...while she's doing it.

00:10:11.143 --> 00:10:13.012 line:95%,end
They're talking about you.

00:10:13.079 --> 00:10:14.413 line:95%,end
I know Mackenzie.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:18.117 line:95%,end
-I know, they're horrible.
-(crying)

00:10:18.184 --> 00:10:20.720 line:95%,end
Why do they do this to you?

00:10:20.786 --> 00:10:23.155 line:95%,end
I don't want you to leave.

00:10:23.222 --> 00:10:25.925 line:95%,end
Like, you think you're one step ahead,
she's four steps ahead of you.

00:10:25.992 --> 00:10:28.027 line:95%,end
Do not underestimate Melissa.


00:10:30.963 --> 00:10:33.966 line:5%,start
(upbeat music playing)

00:10:35.067 --> 00:10:37.803 line:5%,start
JILL: Okay. So where is Melissa?

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:39.739 line:95%,end
She's part of this team.
She needs to be here.

00:10:39.805 --> 00:10:43.175 line:95%,end
<i>It's the next day,</i>
<i>and everybody is there but Melissa.</i>

00:10:43.242 --> 00:10:46.112 line:5%,start
Kendall's not officially in the group.

00:10:46.178 --> 00:10:49.015 line:5%,start
So with Melissa out of the picture,

00:10:49.081 --> 00:10:52.151 line:95%,end
this just opens up doors for Kendall.

00:10:52.218 --> 00:10:55.187 line:95%,end
ABBY: Hey, girls.
Come on, come on, come on.

00:10:55.254 --> 00:10:56.555 line:95%,end
Is that your lantern?

00:10:57.256 --> 00:11:00.092 line:95%,end
Everything else had glass
and it's too heavy.

00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:01.460 line:95%,end
I don't know if this is going to work.

00:11:01.527 --> 00:11:04.664 line:95%,end
I'm just afraid it's too big and high.

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:06.632 line:95%,end
If not, we can look for a smaller one.

00:11:06.699 --> 00:11:08.234 line:95%,end
Okay. Where is Melissa?

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:10.169 line:95%,end
Girls, where's Maddie?

00:11:10.236 --> 00:11:11.737 line:95%,end
We don't know.

00:11:11.804 --> 00:11:13.205 line:95%,end
All right. Let me go find out.

00:11:13.272 --> 00:11:15.441 line:95%,end
Because she would not
show up without calling.

00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:17.543 line:95%,end
Okay. Bring this in
when it's time for your solo.

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:18.444 line:95%,end
-All right?
-Yes.

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:20.079 line:95%,end
And let me see what's going on.

00:11:20.146 --> 00:11:24.316 line:5%,start
I'm starting rehearsal--
no Melissa, no kids.

00:11:24.383 --> 00:11:25.885 line:95%,end
I wonder if she'll be punished.

00:11:25.951 --> 00:11:27.319 line:95%,end
Doubt it.

00:11:27.386 --> 00:11:30.389 line:5%,start
(upbeat music playing)

00:11:30.456 --> 00:11:32.391 line:5%,start
CATHY: Hey, guys, come on in. Apples!

00:11:33.459 --> 00:11:37.430 line:95%,end
So, everybody,
I have some top secret news.

00:11:37.496 --> 00:11:39.832 line:95%,end
We are going to Starbound in Myrtle Beach.

00:11:39.899 --> 00:11:42.501 line:95%,end
So we need to get busy
with new choreography.

00:11:42.568 --> 00:11:45.504 line:5%,start
The last time that I saw
the Abby Lee Dance Company

00:11:45.571 --> 00:11:48.641 line:95%,end
at a competition,
they were not very nice to me.

00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:50.943 line:95%,end
ABBY: I'm in Ohio. I'm on your turf.

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:52.878 line:95%,end
Not even a cocktail party
the night before?

00:11:52.945 --> 00:11:54.113 line:95%,end
No dinner at your house?

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:55.748 line:5%,start
We have the M&amp;M's back

00:11:55.815 --> 00:11:58.684 line:5%,start
-to help with choreography.
-(applause)

00:11:58.751 --> 00:12:01.187 line:95%,end
Mitchell and Michael are working with us.

00:12:01.253 --> 00:12:02.722 line:95%,end
And it's because they would like to see us

00:12:02.788 --> 00:12:04.557 line:95%,end
beat the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:12:04.623 --> 00:12:06.459 line:95%,end
<i>The reason that I brought the M&amp;M's back</i>

00:12:06.525 --> 00:12:08.794 line:95%,end
is because the kids are really
reciprocating to them.

00:12:08.861 --> 00:12:10.596 line:95%,end
They love Mitchell and Michael.

00:12:10.663 --> 00:12:13.466 line:95%,end
<i>I think it's awesome.</i>
<i>I think it puts us on the edge.</i>

00:12:13.532 --> 00:12:15.434 line:95%,end
We need to really work hard this week

00:12:15.501 --> 00:12:20.940 line:95%,end
because Jill and Kendall
have hopped back to Abby's studio.

00:12:21.607 --> 00:12:23.075 line:95%,end
No surprise, of course.

00:12:23.142 --> 00:12:26.779 line:95%,end
Drazen, that's why you are going
to be dancing with us today,

00:12:26.846 --> 00:12:31.383 line:95%,end
because I wanted Justice
to have a male friend.

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:35.688 line:95%,end
So I want Jill and Kendall going down.

00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:38.591 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:12:38.657 --> 00:12:40.559 line:95%,end
ABBY: Five, six, seven, go.

00:12:40.626 --> 00:12:43.262 line:5%,start
Ha! Ha! Ha!

00:12:43.329 --> 00:12:45.464 line:95%,end
Strong arms.
You're reaching for her, Brooke.

00:12:45.531 --> 00:12:47.133 line:95%,end
Reach out there! Boom!

00:12:47.199 --> 00:12:48.667 line:95%,end
<i>So I resume my rehearsal.</i>

00:12:48.734 --> 00:12:50.603 line:95%,end
I don't know what's going on
with Maddie and Melissa,

00:12:50.669 --> 00:12:52.805 line:95%,end
but they need to be here in rehearsal.

00:12:52.872 --> 00:12:55.941 line:95%,end
<i>You signed a contract.</i>
<i>You made a commitment to this team.</i>

00:12:56.008 --> 00:12:58.344 line:95%,end
I don't have time. I just don't.
I have to keep working.

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:01.547 line:95%,end
Okay. Take it from the fan kick.
I want to hear your mouth.

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:04.083 line:95%,end
One, two, three.

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:06.519 line:95%,end
I must say, this is a first
for Melissa not to come.

00:13:06.585 --> 00:13:09.688 line:95%,end
JILL: I'm surprised that Abby
is even going to hold a class

00:13:09.755 --> 00:13:11.190 line:95%,end
without Mackenzie and Maddie.
What's going to happen?

00:13:11.257 --> 00:13:13.325 line:95%,end
Well, I'm sure she won't
put anyone in their spot.

00:13:13.392 --> 00:13:14.593 line:95%,end
-Well, that's my point.
-HOLLY: Oh.

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:16.395 line:95%,end
-CHRISTI: (laughs)
-If my kid wasn't here,

00:13:16.462 --> 00:13:18.030 line:95%,end
someone would be replacing them.

00:13:18.097 --> 00:13:21.033 line:95%,end
<i>I think that Jill is just</i>
<i>loving life right now.</i>

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.936 line:5%,start
Melissa is mad at us,
so she's not showing up for anything.

00:13:24.003 --> 00:13:26.071 line:95%,end
And my two kids are injured.

00:13:26.138 --> 00:13:29.341 line:95%,end
So she can just slither her way in
either with the moms

00:13:29.408 --> 00:13:30.543 line:95%,end
or the kids this week.

00:13:30.609 --> 00:13:32.711 line:95%,end
I guess she's not coming
because she doesn't want to

00:13:32.778 --> 00:13:33.846 line:95%,end
face the music, again.

00:13:33.913 --> 00:13:36.615 line:95%,end
Or maybe she didn't come today
because she can't be handle the truth.

00:13:36.682 --> 00:13:37.917 line:95%,end
-HOLLY: I can't believe she's not here.
-JILL: Well, or both.

00:13:37.983 --> 00:13:39.518 line:95%,end
Well, she knows it'll be
brought up, again.

00:13:40.853 --> 00:13:43.022 line:95%,end
CATHY: You have to bring it to the table.

00:13:43.088 --> 00:13:46.425 line:5%,start
And when you slam on this table,
whose face on this table?


00:13:46.492 --> 00:13:48.260 line:95%,end

-MICHAEL: Jill.

00:13:48.794 --> 00:13:49.628 line:95%,end
Okay?

00:13:49.695 --> 00:13:51.697 line:95%,end
CATHY: <i>The duo is called "The Promotion,"</i>

00:13:51.764 --> 00:13:56.869 line:95%,end
and they are supposed to be
looking like they're focused,

00:13:56.936 --> 00:13:58.504 line:95%,end
intense with each other.

00:13:58.571 --> 00:14:00.139 line:95%,end
They're both out for the competition.

00:14:00.206 --> 00:14:01.473 line:95%,end
We're struggling with that, though.

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:07.446 line:95%,end
And one, two, go three,
go four, go five, go six, seven, eight.

00:14:07.513 --> 00:14:08.547 line:95%,end
Okay, stop.

00:14:08.614 --> 00:14:10.749 line:95%,end
But see how you have,
like, a smirk on your face?

00:14:10.816 --> 00:14:11.851 line:95%,end
-You're mean.
-CATHY: No smirking.

00:14:11.917 --> 00:14:14.954 line:95%,end
Justice finds it very difficult
to do anything

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:18.958 line:95%,end
that presents him
in being a nasty kid-like.

00:14:19.024 --> 00:14:20.459 line:95%,end
So he's got to dig.

00:14:20.526 --> 00:14:21.927 line:95%,end
MITCHELL: Let's put Taylor up here.

00:14:21.994 --> 00:14:25.464 line:5%,start
-CATHY: Just play along with it, okay?
-And then you two go here.

00:14:25.531 --> 00:14:28.500 line:95%,end
-Let's switch and put Erica in the front.
-MITCHELL: Okay.

00:14:28.567 --> 00:14:31.737 line:95%,end
The group number is called
"My Hair Like This."

00:14:31.804 --> 00:14:34.540 line:95%,end
-Go, girls!
-(upbeat music playing)

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:40.746 line:95%,end
<i>I like the number</i>
<i>because it's very on the edge.</i>

00:14:40.813 --> 00:14:43.182 line:95%,end
<i>There's a lot of movement going on.</i>

00:14:43.249 --> 00:14:45.918 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:14:45.985 --> 00:14:47.853 line:95%,end
It's hot. It's a hot dance.

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.688 line:95%,end
MITCHELL: One, two, three--

00:14:49.755 --> 00:14:51.257 line:95%,end
Work!

00:14:51.323 --> 00:14:53.225 line:95%,end
ABBY: I need to talk to my dance captain.

00:14:53.292 --> 00:14:54.593 line:95%,end
Come here.

00:14:55.227 --> 00:14:56.462 line:95%,end
You're down a dancer.

00:14:56.528 --> 00:14:59.064 line:95%,end
So I want you to go out,
get your cell phone,

00:14:59.131 --> 00:15:02.401 line:95%,end
call Maddie and tell her
to get her butt in here right now.

00:15:02.468 --> 00:15:05.838 line:5%,start
NIA: As dance captain,
I have to call Maddie

00:15:05.905 --> 00:15:10.009 line:5%,start
and tell her to come to the dance studio.

00:15:10.075 --> 00:15:12.144 line:95%,end
But I don't know how to get her here

00:15:12.211 --> 00:15:13.913 line:95%,end
because I'm not her mother.

00:15:13.979 --> 00:15:16.815 line:95%,end
Miss Abby really need you here right now.

00:15:16.882 --> 00:15:21.120 line:95%,end
Because I know that you are
one of the featured parts in the dance.

00:15:21.186 --> 00:15:24.924 line:95%,end
During the phone call,
Maddie says that her mother

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:27.359 line:95%,end
won't let her come to the dance studio

00:15:27.426 --> 00:15:30.896 line:95%,end
because Melissa is always mad at the moms.

00:15:30.963 --> 00:15:32.865 line:95%,end
ABBY: Let's take it from the top,
straight through.

00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:37.002 line:95%,end
Remember, you guys are all as one.

00:15:37.069 --> 00:15:39.338 line:95%,end
You think alike. You stand alike.
You act alike.

00:15:39.405 --> 00:15:41.173 line:95%,end
Reach in.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.274 line:95%,end
Go!

00:15:42.341 --> 00:15:45.611 line:95%,end
Three and four--no.

00:15:45.678 --> 00:15:48.981 line:95%,end
You're on the outside,
then you, then Maddie.

00:15:49.048 --> 00:15:49.882 line:95%,end
Here we go.

00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:53.352 line:95%,end
Maddie is the center
of the group choreography.

00:15:53.419 --> 00:15:57.189 line:95%,end
And without her here it's really difficult
to go on with this routine.

00:15:58.557 --> 00:16:00.025 line:95%,end
MELISSA: <i>I really didn't</i>
<i>want to go to the studio,</i>

00:16:00.092 --> 00:16:03.529 line:5%,start
but I finally thought I need to
drop my kids off at rehearsal.

00:16:03.595 --> 00:16:05.464 line:95%,end
I really don't have to be there
when they practice.

00:16:06.131 --> 00:16:07.433 line:95%,end
ABBY: Get in here! Let's go!

00:16:09.468 --> 00:16:10.536 line:95%,end
-HOLLY: Maddie arrived.
-CHRISTI: Oh, good.

00:16:10.602 --> 00:16:12.171 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Look at the timing. She's here.

00:16:12.237 --> 00:16:14.173 line:95%,end
Good. So then we--
our kids don't have to bear

00:16:14.239 --> 00:16:15.541 line:95%,end
the brunt of this one's anger.

00:16:15.607 --> 00:16:18.911 line:95%,end
Hey. I never want this to happen, again.

00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:21.013 line:95%,end
You're in a group dance.
You're part of the team.

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:22.581 line:95%,end
You do not miss rehearsal.

00:16:22.648 --> 00:16:23.849 line:95%,end
This whole thing with your mother--

00:16:23.916 --> 00:16:25.317 line:95%,end
forget about it.

00:16:25.384 --> 00:16:26.685 line:95%,end
You're going to--look up there.

00:16:26.752 --> 00:16:29.555 line:95%,end
You're going to let those women
dictate your future?

00:16:29.621 --> 00:16:30.956 line:95%,end
That's crazy.

00:16:31.023 --> 00:16:34.660 line:95%,end
I cannot believe
how much time we have lost

00:16:34.727 --> 00:16:35.961 line:95%,end
because of Melissa.

00:16:36.028 --> 00:16:38.130 line:95%,end
Run, run! Up! Go!

00:16:38.197 --> 00:16:41.967 line:95%,end
We've got to dig down deep inside
and use everything we've got

00:16:42.034 --> 00:16:44.303 line:95%,end
if we're going to win
this weekend at Starbound.

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:46.538 line:95%,end
Girls, we have two more days--

00:16:46.605 --> 00:16:49.875 line:95%,end
two more days to get this number clean.

00:16:49.942 --> 00:16:51.710 line:95%,end
-You understand?
-Yes.

00:16:51.777 --> 00:16:53.979 line:95%,end
-ABBY: All right, go.
-Thank you.


00:16:56.949 --> 00:16:59.685 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:17:03.489 --> 00:17:05.858 line:95%,end
Thank you for calling
and tipping me off, though.

00:17:05.924 --> 00:17:08.260 line:95%,end
I appreciate my friends in this business.

00:17:08.327 --> 00:17:09.661 line:95%,end
Thanks. Bye-bye.

00:17:09.728 --> 00:17:14.066 line:5%,start
so, lo and behold, I find out that Cathy

00:17:14.133 --> 00:17:18.404 line:95%,end
and her rotten apples
are going to be joining us this weekend.

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:22.641 line:95%,end
<i>Cathy has entered a routine</i>
<i>in each one of our categories.</i>

00:17:22.708 --> 00:17:24.610 line:95%,end
She's obviously out for revenge.

00:17:24.676 --> 00:17:28.380 line:95%,end
Justice is in a duet

00:17:28.447 --> 00:17:29.515 line:95%,end
with another little boy.

00:17:29.581 --> 00:17:30.949 line:95%,end
They don't have another boy.

00:17:31.016 --> 00:17:32.618 line:95%,end
This just gets better and better.

00:17:32.684 --> 00:17:35.754 line:95%,end
Cathy's bringing in a ringer
to dance with Justice

00:17:35.821 --> 00:17:37.556 line:95%,end
and go up against my duet.

00:17:37.623 --> 00:17:40.092 line:95%,end
Maddie can be Justice.
She's beat him before.

00:17:40.159 --> 00:17:42.261 line:95%,end
-She has to do a solo.
-She has to do a solo.

00:17:42.327 --> 00:17:44.797 line:95%,end
I know I told Maddie
she didn't get a solo this week.

00:17:44.863 --> 00:17:48.300 line:95%,end
But now I want her
to go up against Justice,

00:17:48.367 --> 00:17:49.902 line:95%,end
just to intimidate him.

00:17:49.968 --> 00:17:51.170 line:95%,end
Hi, babe. How are you?

00:17:51.236 --> 00:17:52.404 line:95%,end
-I'm good.
-Hi, Ab.

00:17:52.471 --> 00:17:54.673 line:95%,end
ABBY: Hey, Kenz.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:57.209 line:95%,end
You girls go ahead and get ready.
I want to talk to you for a second.

00:17:57.276 --> 00:18:01.780 line:95%,end
Melissa waltzes into the studio
like nothing happened yesterday.

00:18:01.847 --> 00:18:05.250 line:95%,end
At the very least, I think that woman
owes me an explanation.

00:18:05.317 --> 00:18:07.119 line:95%,end
I need to know where, were you yesterday

00:18:07.186 --> 00:18:08.320 line:95%,end
and why the girls weren't here.

00:18:08.387 --> 00:18:10.222 line:95%,end
I was not here. I don't have to be here.

00:18:10.289 --> 00:18:12.257 line:5%,start
I know Abby's upset,
but I don't need to be here

00:18:12.324 --> 00:18:13.692 line:5%,start
when my kids are dancing.

00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:15.894 line:95%,end
And I'm just sick of being
bullied by the moms.

00:18:15.961 --> 00:18:18.464 line:95%,end
My kids take care of themselves,
and they're here on time.

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:19.765 line:95%,end
-So I'm not playing games.
-Okay.

00:18:19.832 --> 00:18:22.234 line:95%,end
Well, I'm not playing games, either.
Maddie's doing a solo this weekend.

00:18:22.301 --> 00:18:24.103 line:95%,end
Yes, she is.
You signed a contract with me.

00:18:24.169 --> 00:18:26.405 line:95%,end
Abby just needs to know giving
my daughter a solo

00:18:26.472 --> 00:18:29.141 line:95%,end
<i>the night before a competition</i>
<i>is just too much pressure.</i>

00:18:29.208 --> 00:18:31.243 line:95%,end
-(indistinct chatter)
-JILL: Hey.

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:32.744 line:95%,end
-HOLLY: Hey.
-JILL: Welcome back.

00:18:32.811 --> 00:18:34.446 line:95%,end
HOLLY: You got to fix yourself.

00:18:34.513 --> 00:18:35.981 line:95%,end
-Can I go ask?
-No.

00:18:36.048 --> 00:18:38.350 line:95%,end
Because Abby's going to tell you
you're doing a solo, and you're not.

00:18:39.852 --> 00:18:40.919 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>You know, it's funny.</i>

00:18:40.986 --> 00:18:43.188 line:5%,start
When Chloe misses a rehearsal
she screamed at.

00:18:43.255 --> 00:18:46.125 line:5%,start
But when Maddie misses,
she's rewarded with a solo.

00:18:46.191 --> 00:18:47.559 line:95%,end
Double standard?

00:18:47.626 --> 00:18:49.294 line:95%,end
-(laughter)
-ABBY: Girls, come on. Let's go.

00:18:49.361 --> 00:18:51.130 line:95%,end
I need you in studio A.

00:18:51.196 --> 00:18:52.764 line:95%,end
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

00:18:53.532 --> 00:18:54.933 line:95%,end
Are we ready?

00:18:56.068 --> 00:18:58.437 line:95%,end
CHLOE: <i>This week my solo is called</i>
<i>"Leave the Light On."</i>

00:18:58.504 --> 00:19:00.772 line:95%,end
<i>Miss Abby said that the story is, like,</i>

00:19:00.839 --> 00:19:04.543 line:5%,start
when it's dark I don't like it,
so I try to, like,

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:07.446 line:5%,start
use the lantern to find
the space where it's all light.

00:19:07.513 --> 00:19:10.682 line:5%,start
SINGER: <i>âªDo you have</i>
<i>your eyes wide open?âª</i>

00:19:10.749 --> 00:19:14.887 line:5%,start
<i>âªCan you feel the whole world shaking?âª</i>

00:19:14.953 --> 00:19:18.790 line:95%,end
Now that I know Candy Apple is going to be
in Myrtle Beach this weekend,

00:19:18.857 --> 00:19:21.226 line:95%,end
<i>I need Chloe's head in the game.</i>

00:19:21.293 --> 00:19:22.861 line:95%,end
<i>My goal is a clean sweep.</i>

00:19:22.928 --> 00:19:25.931 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:19:29.835 --> 00:19:30.802 line:95%,end
ABBY: And, off. Good.

00:19:30.869 --> 00:19:33.505 line:95%,end
When you step out on that stage,
I want you to win.

00:19:33.572 --> 00:19:35.374 line:95%,end
No boy is going to beat me.

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.309 line:95%,end
I have a solo against Justice this week

00:19:37.376 --> 00:19:39.311 line:95%,end
and he's a really good dancer.

00:19:39.378 --> 00:19:42.548 line:95%,end
So I am kind of feeling pressured

00:19:42.614 --> 00:19:44.616 line:95%,end
because now I have to do really good.

00:19:44.683 --> 00:19:46.618 line:95%,end
So we missed you yesterday.

00:19:46.685 --> 00:19:49.421 line:95%,end
What's going on?
You're coming away this weekend.

00:19:49.488 --> 00:19:50.389 line:95%,end
-Yeah.
-Okay.

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:52.691 line:95%,end
What did Abby say to you when you came in?

00:19:52.758 --> 00:19:54.826 line:95%,end
She said my daughter--
your daughter's doing a solo this weekend.

00:19:54.893 --> 00:19:56.395 line:95%,end
I said, no, she's not. And I walked away.

00:19:56.461 --> 00:19:57.429 line:95%,end
-She did?
-Uh-huh.

00:19:57.496 --> 00:19:59.831 line:95%,end
Melissa, why don't you want
Maddie to do a solo?

00:19:59.898 --> 00:20:01.533 line:95%,end
It's not her week to do a solo.

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:04.703 line:95%,end
At pyramid she wasn't assigned it,
so it's not her week.

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:07.739 line:95%,end
If I let Maddie do this solo,
the other moms are going to think that,

00:20:07.806 --> 00:20:10.209 line:95%,end
of course, Maddie is the favorite.
And I'm totally sick of it.


00:20:10.275 --> 00:20:13.011 line:95%,end
And I'm sticking up for myself
and I'm sticking up for my kid.

00:20:13.078 --> 00:20:14.246 line:95%,end
-And I'm--
-Yeah, but how--

00:20:14.313 --> 00:20:16.014 line:95%,end
you don't--you just don't want her to.

00:20:16.081 --> 00:20:17.216 line:95%,end
-No, she's not.
-Which is fine.

00:20:17.282 --> 00:20:18.784 line:95%,end
-It's my decision. I'm the mom.
-I'm just curious.

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:19.918 line:95%,end
She's not the mom.

00:20:19.985 --> 00:20:22.854 line:95%,end
JILL: <i>I don't think it was</i>
<i>really fair of Abby</i>

00:20:22.921 --> 00:20:25.057 line:95%,end
<i>to ask Maddie to do a solo.</i>

00:20:25.123 --> 00:20:28.627 line:5%,start
If Abby had said, "Kendall,
I need you to do a solo,"

00:20:28.694 --> 00:20:29.795 line:95%,end
she would have done it.

00:20:29.861 --> 00:20:31.797 line:95%,end
So what's Abby's reasoning behind it?

00:20:31.863 --> 00:20:33.332 line:95%,end
-Yeah.
-You should ask her.

00:20:33.398 --> 00:20:34.333 line:95%,end
-No. Didn't want to.
-Because she heard that

00:20:34.399 --> 00:20:37.402 line:95%,end
Candy Apple was coming,

00:20:37.469 --> 00:20:39.304 line:95%,end
-That's why.
-HOLLY: That's probably what it is.

00:20:39.371 --> 00:20:40.505 line:95%,end
-Chloe Will do just great.
-Chloe will do just great.

00:20:40.572 --> 00:20:42.174 line:95%,end
-But for her to ask her--
-But, obviously, Abby doesn't think that.

00:20:42.241 --> 00:20:43.242 line:95%,end
Play her game, Melissa.

00:20:43.308 --> 00:20:45.611 line:95%,end
It just goes to show how much value Abby

00:20:45.677 --> 00:20:47.279 line:95%,end
puts on all of her students.

00:20:47.346 --> 00:20:49.514 line:95%,end
But she should really
just take Chloe's solo

00:20:49.581 --> 00:20:52.050 line:95%,end
and just give it to Maddie.
Because why have them com--

00:20:52.117 --> 00:20:54.620 line:95%,end
if you don't feel Chloe is good enough,
don't have to be your--

00:20:54.686 --> 00:20:55.721 line:95%,end
your go-to loser.

00:20:55.787 --> 00:20:56.922 line:95%,end
Just give it to Maddie.

00:20:56.989 --> 00:20:59.324 line:95%,end
Abby's expecting a clean sweep
this week at Starbound.

00:20:59.391 --> 00:21:01.593 line:95%,end
And now that she's heard
the Candy Apples is going to be there,

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:03.462 line:95%,end
of course, she doesn't have
enough faith in Chloe.

00:21:03.528 --> 00:21:05.864 line:95%,end
And now she wants Maddie to dance.

00:21:05.931 --> 00:21:08.600 line:95%,end
ABBY: Go. Point your feet!

00:21:10.936 --> 00:21:12.504 line:95%,end
DeveloppÃ© down.

00:21:12.571 --> 00:21:15.674 line:95%,end
MACKENZIE: <i>I'm really excited</i>
<i>because we're going to Myrtle Beach.</i>

00:21:15.741 --> 00:21:18.277 line:5%,start
And I'm doing a duet with Kendall,

00:21:18.343 --> 00:21:20.746 line:5%,start
and it's called "Reservations for Two,"

00:21:20.812 --> 00:21:22.814 line:95%,end
and it's an acro routine.

00:21:24.116 --> 00:21:27.052 line:95%,end
No way are you going to lose
to some other boy.

00:21:27.119 --> 00:21:30.088 line:5%,start
Fan kick! Finish the turn!

00:21:33.659 --> 00:21:35.661 line:95%,end
You're going to ruin that
if you keep doing that like that.

00:21:35.727 --> 00:21:37.229 line:95%,end
Don't dive!

00:21:37.296 --> 00:21:39.798 line:95%,end
<i>The stakes are high</i>
<i>for Kendall and Mackenzie.</i>

00:21:39.865 --> 00:21:44.569 line:95%,end
They're going up against Justice
and Cathy's new little ringer.

00:21:44.636 --> 00:21:48.573 line:95%,end
<i>Hopefully, these two can pull it off.</i>

00:21:49.608 --> 00:21:51.176 line:95%,end
(sighs)

00:21:51.243 --> 00:21:54.713 line:95%,end
I'm looking for a clean sweep
this weekend at Starbound.

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:56.982 line:95%,end
But this duet has me worried.

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:00.752 line:95%,end
(tense music playing)

00:22:00.819 --> 00:22:02.387 line:95%,end
ABBY: What's the real truth?

00:22:02.454 --> 00:22:03.622 line:95%,end
Tell me the real truth.

00:22:03.689 --> 00:22:06.958 line:95%,end
You don't want to do a solo?
You just want a week off?

00:22:07.025 --> 00:22:08.960 line:95%,end
It's just that I can't learn a solo at...

00:22:09.027 --> 00:22:10.729 line:95%,end
I don't want to go there and not win.

00:22:10.796 --> 00:22:12.397 line:95%,end
You have beaten boys before.

00:22:12.464 --> 00:22:14.900 line:95%,end
I don't care what's going on with Melissa
and the other moms.

00:22:14.966 --> 00:22:17.436 line:95%,end
<i>Maddie should be doing this solo for me.</i>

00:22:17.502 --> 00:22:20.839 line:95%,end
Just Maddie's name
being typed in that program

00:22:20.906 --> 00:22:23.308 line:95%,end
up against Justice will intimidate him.

00:22:23.375 --> 00:22:24.676 line:95%,end
So, you know what?

00:22:24.743 --> 00:22:26.978 line:95%,end
I feel like I'm giving you an opportunity

00:22:27.045 --> 00:22:28.447 line:95%,end
and you're (bleep) all over me.

00:22:28.513 --> 00:22:31.750 line:5%,start
It's really tough because
Miss Abby wants me to do a solo

00:22:31.817 --> 00:22:33.985 line:95%,end
and my mom doesn't want me to do a solo.

00:22:34.052 --> 00:22:35.520 line:95%,end
And I got to listen to my mom.

00:22:35.587 --> 00:22:36.421 line:95%,end
-Goodnight!
-Goodnight.

00:22:36.488 --> 00:22:37.723 line:95%,end
Melissa, I want to
talk to you for a second.

00:22:38.657 --> 00:22:40.092 line:95%,end
Okay.

00:22:40.158 --> 00:22:41.960 line:95%,end
I just want to talk to you
about the solo thing.

00:22:42.027 --> 00:22:44.763 line:95%,end
If Melissa doesn't let Maddie do a solo,

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:46.965 line:95%,end
she might just cost us the win.

00:22:47.032 --> 00:22:49.601 line:95%,end
If that's the case,
I'll never forgive her.

00:22:49.668 --> 00:22:52.704 line:95%,end
That Cathy, the hick in the stick,
she's coming.

00:22:52.771 --> 00:22:53.605 line:95%,end
All right?

00:22:53.672 --> 00:22:55.907 line:95%,end
Any one of my kids could do a solo.
That's not what it's about.

00:22:55.974 --> 00:22:58.543 line:95%,end
It's about I want to intimidate him.

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:01.713 line:95%,end
It is--it's too late in the game.
I'm not do--I'm sorry, Abby.

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:03.615 line:95%,end
I don't want to disappoint you,
but it is what it is.

00:23:03.682 --> 00:23:05.250 line:95%,end
I don't care what Abby says.

00:23:05.317 --> 00:23:07.986 line:95%,end
I know Candy Apples are coming,
but I'm not letting my daughter

00:23:08.053 --> 00:23:10.355 line:95%,end
learn a solo the night
before the competition.

00:23:10.422 --> 00:23:12.791 line:95%,end
ABBY: Well, I think she
could have learned it today.

00:23:12.858 --> 00:23:14.459 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Well, I got to go.
I got to get my kids to bed

00:23:14.526 --> 00:23:16.461 line:95%,end
so we can get on the plane.


00:23:20.065 --> 00:23:23.568 line:5%,start

<i>This is going to be</i>

00:23:31.643 --> 00:23:35.414 line:5%,start
And I found out that
Cathy and the Crab Apples

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:36.448 line:5%,start
are going to be here.

00:23:37.249 --> 00:23:39.317 line:95%,end
<i>There's a lot at stake.</i>

00:23:39.384 --> 00:23:40.819 line:95%,end
Come on. Game faces.

00:23:40.886 --> 00:23:42.854 line:95%,end
We ready, ladies? Let's do it.

00:23:58.403 --> 00:24:00.272 line:95%,end
All right. Everybody stay together.

00:24:00.338 --> 00:24:02.674 line:95%,end
-Oh, that voice!
-I heard it, too!

00:24:02.741 --> 00:24:04.276 line:95%,end
-Oh, my gosh!
-I heard it!

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:07.546 line:95%,end
Yeah, look at this.
We have lots of room to practice.

00:24:07.612 --> 00:24:08.613 line:95%,end
-Love it.
-WOMAN: Yeah.

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.348 line:95%,end
-Absolutely.
-Oh, my god, that voice.

00:24:10.415 --> 00:24:13.018 line:95%,end
It, like, haunts you in your nightmares.

00:24:13.084 --> 00:24:14.719 line:95%,end
Jill, come over here, please.

00:24:16.321 --> 00:24:21.059 line:95%,end
Now without alarming
everybody in the room,

00:24:21.126 --> 00:24:22.694 line:95%,end
tell me who this is.

00:24:22.761 --> 00:24:26.898 line:95%,end
I look at the program
and I see Justice and Drazen.

00:24:26.965 --> 00:24:29.267 line:95%,end
<i>I don't know who this person is.</i>

00:24:29.334 --> 00:24:32.471 line:95%,end
All I do know is that he's some ringer.

00:24:32.537 --> 00:24:34.806 line:95%,end
This is not one of Cathy's students.

00:24:34.873 --> 00:24:37.943 line:95%,end
-Never seen that name before.
-I've never seen that name--Drazen.

00:24:38.009 --> 00:24:40.612 line:95%,end
-So you don't know who that is.
-Uh-uh. I swear I don't.

00:24:40.679 --> 00:24:41.947 line:95%,end
-I don't know--
-ABBY: You've never heard.

00:24:42.013 --> 00:24:43.915 line:95%,end
-You swear on your life?
-I swear.

00:24:43.982 --> 00:24:46.585 line:95%,end
Abby, I'm on your side. I would tell you.

00:24:46.651 --> 00:24:48.386 line:95%,end
<i>Abby needs to trust me.</i>

00:24:48.453 --> 00:24:50.455 line:5%,start
My alliance is with her.

00:24:50.522 --> 00:24:53.024 line:5%,start
That's what my daughter
is here for, for Abby,

00:24:53.091 --> 00:24:54.125 line:95%,end
and we're here to win.

00:24:54.192 --> 00:24:56.428 line:95%,end
Guys, can you come in for just a moment?

00:24:56.495 --> 00:24:59.531 line:95%,end
I just want to kind of give you
a heads up on what's going on. Okay?

00:24:59.598 --> 00:25:02.100 line:95%,end
If anybody's tweeting you,
it's none of their business.

00:25:02.167 --> 00:25:05.070 line:95%,end
It's our little surprise attack.

00:25:05.136 --> 00:25:05.971 line:95%,end
Okay?

00:25:06.037 --> 00:25:08.807 line:95%,end
And Drazen, honestly,
I'd kind of like to keep you

behind closed doors

00:25:09.808 --> 00:25:11.743 line:95%,end
just because they don't know
who the heck you are.

00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:15.313 line:5%,start
Drazen is somebody that does
not compete at the dance studio.

00:25:33.565 --> 00:25:36.601 line:95%,end
And she needs to go on that stage

00:25:36.668 --> 00:25:38.603 line:95%,end
Let's go. Come on, Chloe. This is it.

-Yes.

You could have psyched him out.

00:29:23.328 --> 00:29:25.563 line:95%,end

it's unprofessional.

the moms would have freaked out on me.

It was really weird
competing against Justice

We beat her fair and square.

Yeah, really.

I didn't have any boys
in a number today.

00:40:03.634 --> 00:40:06.237 line:95%,end
No, but Abby, even your girls don't.

00:40:06.303 --> 00:40:07.338 line:95%,end
Don't do what?

00:40:07.405 --> 00:40:08.472 line:95%,end
-MITCHELL: They don't do that difficulty.
-CATHY: Your girls--

Fresh and new?

00:40:12.676 --> 00:40:14.845 line:95%,end
Straight legs and stretched feet
will never go out of style.

00:40:14.912 --> 00:40:16.213 line:95%,end
CATHY:
Oh, you're right. They won't.

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:17.181 line:95%,end
You're absolutely right.

00:40:17.248 --> 00:40:19.617 line:95%,end

let's put Vivi-Anne right
up against Mackenzie.

00:40:24.321 --> 00:40:26.524 line:95%,end
Let's put the two 8-year-olds
up against each other.

00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:27.691 line:95%,end
CATHY: You know what?
I have to hold back.

00:40:27.758 --> 00:40:31.962 line:95%,end
Because my little 8-year-old has improved
week after week after week.

00:40:32.029 --> 00:40:33.364 line:95%,end
Because they don't go to school.

-Hey, listen!
-MELISSA: My daughter--

00:40:44.275 --> 00:40:46.911 line:5%,start
It was you who called Vivi a human prop!

00:40:46.977 --> 00:40:48.279 line:5%,start
-MELISSA: She is!
-So don't tell me to shut up!

00:40:48.345 --> 00:40:49.647 line:5%,start
-MELISSA: Yes, but I know--
-I think you need to take

00:40:49.713 --> 00:40:51.916 line:5%,start
your little technicolor ass
and get out of here.

00:40:52.616 --> 00:40:54.752 line:5%,start
Cathy has two guest choreographers,

00:40:54.819 --> 00:40:57.721 line:5%,start
a ringer, and older girls
dancing in her group.
