ABBY: <i>Previously,</i>

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:04.371 line:5%,start
MAN (over the phone):
<i>(indistinct) this weekend has</i>
<i>been canceled.</i>

00:00:05.472 --> 00:00:07.340 line:5%,start
Oh, my God.

00:00:07.407 --> 00:00:08.842 line:5%,start
-Calm down, calm down.
-(sobs)

00:00:08.908 --> 00:00:10.310 line:5%,start
Nia...

00:00:10.377 --> 00:00:11.978 line:5%,start
Whatever. I'll pack my bags

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:13.279 line:5%,start
and go home right now!

00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:15.315 line:5%,start
-That would not make me happy--
-Because that's what I'm doing!

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:17.317 line:5%,start
-ABBY: And you know who's gonna
lose? -I'm sick of this (bleep)!

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:19.686 line:5%,start
-ANNOUNCER: <i>This is Maddie.</i>
-(cheers and applause)

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:20.787 line:5%,start
ANNOUNCER: <i>Here we go.</i>

00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:22.856 line:5%,start
-(dramatic effect)
-JILL: Oh! I gotta go.

00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:24.591 line:5%,start
I don't want to make Abby mad.

00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:26.559 line:5%,start
ABBY: Jill, you have a big
decision to make.

00:00:26.626 --> 00:00:27.594 line:5%,start
Don't take it lightly.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.195 line:5%,start
I'll discuss it
with my daughter.

00:00:29.262 --> 00:00:30.563 line:5%,start
You know? What we come up with.

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:32.799 line:5%,start
<i>That's just a little something.</i>

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.100 line:5%,start
ABBY: <i>You know</i>
<i>everyone's going hate you</i>

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:35.502 line:5%,start
-when they see that?
-I've got nothing to lose.

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:36.403 line:5%,start
-(laughing)
-Right?

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:38.004 line:5%,start
-CHRISTI: I think you should--
-You guys pick on me

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:39.305 line:5%,start
'cause you push me out--

00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:40.874 line:5%,start
-I think because you're a
diva... -...that's what she
wants.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:41.841 line:5%,start
-...table for one.
-Oh.

00:00:41.908 --> 00:00:43.109 line:5%,start
ABBY: I have had it with you!

00:00:43.176 --> 00:00:44.044 line:5%,start
What is she saying?

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.346 line:5%,start
ABBY: You didn't show up
the whole month to take class.

00:00:46.413 --> 00:00:48.148 line:5%,start
Your mother sits out
there and screams.

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:50.016 line:5%,start
We come to Dance to dance,

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:51.818 line:5%,start
and sitting there is not dance.

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:52.719 line:5%,start
Go.

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:54.320 line:5%,start
HOLLY: <i>And I think the guns are,</i>
<i>also as moms,</i>

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:56.156 line:5%,start
it's throwing us off a bit.

00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:57.791 line:5%,start
I've done children with guns.

00:00:57.857 --> 00:00:59.959 line:5%,start
<i>That's what we entered,</i>
<i>that's what we're doing.</i>

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:01.061 line:5%,start
(gunshot)

00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:03.496 line:95%,end
(theme music playing)

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:05.065 line:95%,end
SINGER: <i>âªGet upâª</i>

00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:06.900 line:95%,end
<i>âªGet on the floorâª</i>

00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:09.903 line:95%,end

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:12.272 line:95%,end

00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:16.609 line:5%,start
(dramatic music playing)

00:01:16.676 --> 00:01:18.011 line:5%,start
ABBY: <i>Ladies! Let's go!</i>

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:18.912 line:5%,start
<i>Come on!</i>

00:01:18.978 --> 00:01:20.213 line:95%,end
We have lots to go over.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.682 line:95%,end
It's going to be a busy,
busy, busy week here.

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:23.750 line:95%,end
No coming late,

00:01:23.817 --> 00:01:25.051 line:95%,end
no leaving early.

00:01:25.618 --> 00:01:27.854 line:95%,end
Now, Texas.

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:31.224 line:95%,end
We had all these plans made

00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:32.425 line:95%,end
to go to New Jersey.

00:01:32.492 --> 00:01:34.227 line:95%,end
And then, at the last minute,

00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:35.695 line:95%,end
we have to completely flip it.

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:37.664 line:95%,end
There's a lot of dance companies
in this country

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.799 line:95%,end
that would have said,
"Fine, we're not going."

00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:41.234 line:95%,end
And we didn't do that. We went,

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:42.836 line:95%,end
some great things happened

00:01:42.902 --> 00:01:45.638 line:95%,end
and some really bad
things happened.

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:48.942 line:95%,end
Now, this week,

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:50.944 line:95%,end
we are going to Hollywood Vibe

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.545 line:95%,end
right here in Pittsburgh.

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:54.147 line:95%,end
(applause)

00:01:54.214 --> 00:01:57.217 line:95%,end
I want to see 100%
from every single one of you.

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:59.619 line:95%,end
Remember, we're in our backyard.

00:01:59.686 --> 00:02:01.754 line:95%,end
You have a target on your back,

00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:03.056 line:95%,end
so do I.

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:06.860 line:95%,end
<i>There's a little bit more riding</i>
<i>on Hollywood Vibe</i>

00:02:06.926 --> 00:02:09.162 line:5%,start
because it's in
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.931 line:95%,end
The group number is
called "Private Eyes."

00:02:12.565 --> 00:02:14.801 line:95%,end
I'm going to arm you
with the secret weapon.

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:17.904 line:95%,end
You're going to be using guns...

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:19.739 line:95%,end
-(dramatic effect)
-ABBY: ...in your routine.

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:21.341 line:95%,end
When you step on that stage,

00:02:21.407 --> 00:02:22.942 line:95%,end
I want you to kill it.

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.843 line:95%,end
Understood?

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.045 line:95%,end
You're going to blow
the competition away.

00:02:26.112 --> 00:02:27.981 line:5%,start
I'm not really
thrilled at the idea

00:02:28.047 --> 00:02:30.383 line:5%,start
of my daughter dancing on stage
with a weapon.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.752 line:95%,end
Plastic or not, it's still
sending the wrong message.

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.622 line:95%,end
But I'm so used to sending
the wrong message at Abby's,

00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:37.023 line:95%,end
I should really just...

00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:39.025 line:95%,end
I should give up.

00:02:39.092 --> 00:02:40.593 line:95%,end
Now, we're going to
move into the pyramid.

00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:42.562 line:95%,end
Mackenzie...

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.398 line:95%,end
you went from first to worst

00:02:45.465 --> 00:02:46.833 line:95%,end
in one routine.

00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:49.369 line:95%,end
You always have to keep working.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.372 line:95%,end
Nia, you had a pretty dance.

00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:53.706 line:95%,end
I thought you did well.

00:02:53.773 --> 00:02:54.908 line:95%,end
No problem.

00:02:56.476 --> 00:02:57.544 line:95%,end
Kendall...

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.379 line:95%,end
I understand the
costume was an issue...

00:02:59.445 --> 00:03:00.780 line:95%,end
This is Kendall's costume.

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:02.949 line:95%,end
They don't need a
$500 costume to win.

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:05.318 line:95%,end
I'm sick of this (bleep)!

00:03:05.385 --> 00:03:07.387 line:95%,end
ABBY: Jill, I'm sure you have
something to say about it,

00:03:07.453 --> 00:03:08.621 line:95%,end
but I'll tell you what--

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:10.256 line:95%,end
it doesn't matter what you wear.

00:03:10.323 --> 00:03:12.058 line:95%,end
Ultimately, at the
end of the day,

00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:12.959 line:95%,end
it's your technique.

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:14.494 line:95%,end
That's what you need to work on.

00:03:15.228 --> 00:03:18.064 line:95%,end
All right. Next, Maddie.

00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:19.265 line:95%,end
(dramatic effect)

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.702 line:95%,end
Maddie, you could have been
seriously injured.

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.805 line:95%,end
(dramatic music playing)

00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:29.842 line:95%,end
ABBY: Get the pout
off your face, Maddie.

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:31.644 line:95%,end
You know that you
made that mistake,

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:32.946 line:95%,end
and that's what you get.

00:03:33.446 --> 00:03:35.381 line:95%,end
JILL: <i>I don't feel that Maddie</i>
<i>should be at the bottom</i>

00:03:35.448 --> 00:03:36.583 line:95%,end
<i>of the pyramid this week.</i>

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:37.684 line:95%,end
<i>I think it's ridiculous.</i>

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.452 line:5%,start
She fell, things happen,

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.555 line:5%,start
and I'm just glad my
daughter's not hurt.

00:03:43.456 --> 00:03:45.291 line:95%,end
ABBY: So let that be a lesson
to everybody.

00:03:45.358 --> 00:03:47.393 line:95%,end
Don't change your
mind in midair.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.661 line:95%,end
Moving on.

00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:49.596 line:95%,end
Chloe.

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:51.664 line:95%,end
Chloe, it was good,

00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:53.499 line:95%,end
but obviously not good enough.

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:55.501 line:95%,end
Next, I have Brooke.

00:03:55.568 --> 00:03:56.703 line:95%,end
Great performance,

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.204 line:95%,end
and then forgot the ending.

00:03:58.271 --> 00:04:00.540 line:95%,end
You didn't know what you were
doing and you just fizzled out.

00:04:00.607 --> 00:04:02.108 line:95%,end
And on the top of the pyramid...

00:04:02.976 --> 00:04:04.410 line:95%,end
-Paige.
-(squealing)

00:04:04.477 --> 00:04:06.179 line:95%,end
(dramatic music playing)

00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:07.347 line:95%,end
ABBY: Paige, your
legs were straight.

00:04:07.413 --> 00:04:08.615 line:95%,end
Your feet were pointed.

00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:09.849 line:95%,end
And you went out
there and you won it.

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:11.784 line:95%,end
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

00:04:11.851 --> 00:04:13.586 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>I think</i>
<i>everybody in the room</i>

00:04:13.653 --> 00:04:16.422 line:5%,start
just wanted to, like,
jump up and down for Paige.
(laughs)

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.591 line:95%,end
She has never been
at the top of the pyramid,

00:04:18.658 --> 00:04:20.526 line:95%,end
<i>and she really deserves this.</i>

00:04:21.394 --> 00:04:23.329 line:95%,end
All right, ladies,
the group number,

00:04:23.396 --> 00:04:25.131 line:95%,end
everyone will be dancing

00:04:25.198 --> 00:04:26.799 line:95%,end
except Mackenzie.

00:04:26.866 --> 00:04:28.735 line:95%,end
I'm going to enter a trio...

00:04:30.336 --> 00:04:33.906 line:95%,end
Chloe, Maddie, and...

00:04:36.542 --> 00:04:37.510 line:95%,end
Paige.

00:04:38.711 --> 00:04:40.313 line:95%,end
I'm going to pick you
back into the trio

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.681 line:95%,end
because you're on
top of the pyramid.

00:04:42.348 --> 00:04:43.716 line:95%,end
Kendall...

00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:44.817 line:95%,end
get the look on your face.

00:04:44.884 --> 00:04:46.819 line:95%,end
I can't take any
chances this week.

00:04:46.886 --> 00:04:49.355 line:95%,end
I need to win.

00:04:49.422 --> 00:04:51.357 line:95%,end
JILL: <i>Kendall and I</i>
<i>decide to stick this out.</i>

00:04:51.424 --> 00:04:53.092 line:95%,end
<i>We want to make this work.</i>

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:54.927 line:95%,end
<i>We are team players.</i>

00:04:54.994 --> 00:04:56.129 line:5%,start
So we come back,

00:04:56.195 --> 00:04:57.463 line:5%,start
we're part of the team,


00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.632 line:5%,start
and this is how Abby repays us--

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:01.668 line:95%,end
by taking Kendall
out of the trio.

00:05:01.734 --> 00:05:02.669 line:95%,end
Chloe...

00:05:02.735 --> 00:05:03.936 line:95%,end
you will be doing a solo.

00:05:04.003 --> 00:05:05.705 line:95%,end
Maddie, you will
be doing a solo.

00:05:05.772 --> 00:05:07.206 line:95%,end
We're taking two champions

00:05:07.273 --> 00:05:08.908 line:95%,end
that already won
at Hollywood Vibe.

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:11.577 line:95%,end
I'm telling you,
one of you better with it again.

00:05:11.644 --> 00:05:13.212 line:95%,end
-Do you understand?
-GIRLS: Yes.

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:15.715 line:95%,end
I want to see that
champion in the studio.

00:05:16.382 --> 00:05:17.283 line:95%,end
You're dismissed.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:18.785 line:95%,end
-Thank you.
-GIRLS: Thank you.

00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:20.019 line:95%,end
No. You guys spread apart.

00:05:20.086 --> 00:05:21.020 line:95%,end
Let's go.

00:05:21.087 --> 00:05:23.556 line:5%,start
(upbeat music playing)

00:05:24.524 --> 00:05:26.693 line:5%,start
Girls, This is Hollywood Vibe.

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:28.661 line:5%,start
The last time you
did your group there,

00:05:28.728 --> 00:05:29.595 line:5%,start
you didn't win.

00:05:29.662 --> 00:05:30.830 line:95%,end
It was embarrassing.

00:05:30.897 --> 00:05:32.899 line:95%,end
<i>The group number is</i>
<i>called </i>Private Eyes.

00:05:32.965 --> 00:05:34.300 line:95%,end
Every so many years,

00:05:34.367 --> 00:05:36.669 line:95%,end
I do some type of Dick Tracy,

something-something.

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:43.376 line:95%,end
But I wanted to make
it a little edgier,

00:05:43.443 --> 00:05:45.845 line:95%,end
so guns.

00:05:45.912 --> 00:05:47.980 line:95%,end
I need--I need spies.

00:05:48.047 --> 00:05:50.216 line:95%,end
I need detectives.

00:05:50.283 --> 00:05:52.685 line:95%,end
Well, I'm sure hoping that
they're using just their fingers
as guns,

00:05:52.752 --> 00:05:54.220 line:95%,end
because I know those--

00:05:54.287 --> 00:05:55.455 line:95%,end
<i>I know we're not allowed</i>
<i>to use those guns.</i>

00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:57.623 line:95%,end
-Just like you said, they are
not allowed. -It is written--

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.292 line:95%,end
I don't think we should allow
them to use guns.

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:00.493 line:95%,end
-Absolutely. I think at some
point... -No.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.461 line:95%,end
...we just need to
put our foot down.

00:06:02.261 --> 00:06:04.330 line:95%,end
<i>I don't have a</i>
<i>problem with the gun</i>

00:06:04.397 --> 00:06:05.365 line:95%,end
or that idea.

00:06:05.431 --> 00:06:06.966 line:95%,end
I don't think little girl
should be dancing

00:06:07.033 --> 00:06:08.468 line:95%,end
around on stage with
guns in their hands.

00:06:08.534 --> 00:06:10.136 line:95%,end
-CHRISTI: I agree with that.
-I think we do have some
standards here.

00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:11.337 line:95%,end
-MELISSA: <i>Yes.</i>
-HOLLY: <i>And they shouldn't be</i>
<i>doing that.</i>

00:06:11.404 --> 00:06:12.672 line:95%,end
-Oh, teach my kid to use guns.
-You're going to blow

00:06:12.739 --> 00:06:14.340 line:95%,end
the competition away.

00:06:14.407 --> 00:06:15.908 line:95%,end
-Yeah. Blow the competition and
kill. -(overlapping chatter)

00:06:15.975 --> 00:06:17.443 line:95%,end
If you can't beat
'em, shoot 'em.

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:18.611 line:95%,end
That doesn't--yeah.

00:06:18.678 --> 00:06:20.246 line:95%,end
That doesn't sound
like "Charlie's Angels."

00:06:20.313 --> 00:06:22.315 line:95%,end
1 and 2, and 3, and...

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.818 line:95%,end
So I'm glad Paige
is back in the trio.

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:28.354 line:95%,end
-I am, too.
-I know.

00:06:28.421 --> 00:06:30.356 line:95%,end
JILL: I don't understand why.

00:06:30.423 --> 00:06:32.058 line:95%,end
I thought for sure

00:06:32.125 --> 00:06:33.659 line:95%,end
she was going to put
Kendall back in it.

00:06:33.726 --> 00:06:35.862 line:95%,end
Paige was at the top
of the pyramid this week.

00:06:35.928 --> 00:06:37.397 line:95%,end
-MELISSA: That's why.
-She should be doing a solo.

00:06:37.463 --> 00:06:39.298 line:95%,end
Not just a trio,
She should be doing a solo.

00:06:39.365 --> 00:06:40.900 line:95%,end
She's at the top of the pyramid.

00:06:40.967 --> 00:06:42.869 line:95%,end
Jill's a little upset
that the Kendall's not in the
trio.

00:06:42.935 --> 00:06:45.738 line:95%,end
But when Kendall
was in the trio and Paige
wasn't,

00:06:45.805 --> 00:06:48.541 line:95%,end
<i>Jill couldn't understand</i>
<i>why Kelly would be upset about</i>
<i>anything.</i>

00:06:48.608 --> 00:06:51.677 line:95%,end
So, Jill, what's good for the
goose is good for the gander.

00:06:51.744 --> 00:06:54.147 line:95%,end
I'm feeling pretty
left out for my child,

00:06:54.213 --> 00:06:56.616 line:95%,end
who has been here
since she was three.

00:06:56.682 --> 00:06:57.817 line:95%,end
And she's never had a trio.

00:06:57.884 --> 00:06:59.585 line:95%,end
Holly, maybe if you were here
more often...

00:06:59.652 --> 00:07:00.486 line:95%,end
(Christi gasps)

00:07:00.553 --> 00:07:03.923 line:95%,end
...and Abby thought you were
more a part of us in the team,

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:05.758 line:95%,end
maybe she would get more parts.

00:07:05.825 --> 00:07:07.093 line:95%,end
I just don't want
to pay extra for it.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.661 line:95%,end
But, yes, I want my
child to feel good.

00:07:08.728 --> 00:07:09.829 line:95%,end
(Christi chuckles)

00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:11.130 line:95%,end
See where you are?

00:07:11.197 --> 00:07:12.465 line:95%,end
Now go back.

00:07:12.532 --> 00:07:15.568 line:95%,end
Jill, it looks like Kendall is
getting a special little part in
there.

00:07:16.002 --> 00:07:17.236 line:95%,end
So you ought to be
happy about that.

00:07:17.303 --> 00:07:18.404 line:95%,end
Then pat me on the back.

00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:19.539 line:95%,end
Maybe I'm doing something right.

00:07:19.605 --> 00:07:21.641 line:95%,end
Money well spent on those gifts.

00:07:22.141 --> 00:07:24.844 line:95%,end
JILL: You guys always
want to jump down my throat.

00:07:25.745 --> 00:07:28.648 line:95%,end
You act like I've slashed
your tires or something.

00:07:28.714 --> 00:07:30.349 line:95%,end
I've done nothing wrong.

00:07:30.416 --> 00:07:32.618 line:95%,end
I'm trying to make things
better for myself

00:07:32.685 --> 00:07:33.586 line:95%,end
and my daughter here.

00:07:33.653 --> 00:07:35.354 line:95%,end
-When the gifts don't work...
-JILL: That's it.

00:07:35.421 --> 00:07:36.589 line:95%,end
...watch your tires!

00:07:36.656 --> 00:07:39.158 line:95%,end
(tense music playing)

00:07:40.893 --> 00:07:43.362 line:95%,end
(playful music playing)

00:07:46.766 --> 00:07:48.968 line:95%,end
Oh, my goodness.

00:07:49.535 --> 00:07:52.205 line:95%,end
JILL: <i>I see how presents</i>
<i>go over well with Abby.</i>

00:07:52.271 --> 00:07:53.806 line:95%,end
Just a little something.

00:07:53.873 --> 00:07:55.675 line:95%,end
<i>We're going to</i>
<i>put a little bench</i>

00:07:55.741 --> 00:07:56.943 line:95%,end
<i>in front of the dance studio.</i>

00:07:57.009 --> 00:07:58.744 line:95%,end
We're going to spruce
it up a little bit.

00:07:58.811 --> 00:08:00.580 line:95%,end
<i>I hope Abby appreciates it.</i>

00:08:00.646 --> 00:08:01.681 line:95%,end
Thank you so much.

00:08:01.747 --> 00:08:03.583 line:95%,end
-You're very welcome.
-It's beautiful.

00:08:03.649 --> 00:08:05.117 line:95%,end
You know everyone's
going to hate you.

00:08:08.754 --> 00:08:09.922 line:95%,end
What is that?

00:08:09.989 --> 00:08:11.624 line:95%,end
Good morning.

00:08:11.691 --> 00:08:13.626 line:95%,end
-KELLY: "To Abby Lee--"
-HOLLY: Oh, good morning.

00:08:13.693 --> 00:08:15.428 line:95%,end
Oh, my God.

00:08:16.128 --> 00:08:17.430 line:95%,end
Just a little something

00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:19.765 line:95%,end
-we could all appreciate.
-Oh, for the love of God, Jill.

00:08:19.832 --> 00:08:21.000 line:95%,end
-(laughs)
-It's not for Abby.

00:08:21.067 --> 00:08:22.301 line:95%,end
It's for the studio.

00:08:22.368 --> 00:08:24.904 line:95%,end
A bench dedicated to Abby...

00:08:25.905 --> 00:08:27.373 line:5%,start
(sighs)

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.141 line:5%,start
I think I've seen it all now.

00:08:29.208 --> 00:08:30.643 line:95%,end
Good Lord.

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:32.879 line:95%,end
HOLLY: It's, like,
a shrine to Abby.

00:08:32.945 --> 00:08:35.248 line:95%,end
Well, it's actually
a shrine to Jill.

00:08:35.314 --> 00:08:37.083 line:95%,end
I thought Melissa was bad.

00:08:37.149 --> 00:08:40.353 line:95%,end
<i>And the level of brown nosing</i>
<i>that Jill has brought to the</i>
<i>table</i>

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:41.888 line:95%,end
<i>has just raised the ante.</i>

00:08:41.954 --> 00:08:44.624 line:95%,end
Maybe you'll get to the top
of the ass kiss pyramid.

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:46.058 line:95%,end
<i>Now, Melissa is going</i>
<i>to be running around--</i>

00:08:46.125 --> 00:08:47.727 line:95%,end
<i>"How can I out brown</i>
<i>nose this one."</i>

00:08:47.793 --> 00:08:50.563 line:95%,end
So all bets are off
at the Abby Lee Dance company.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:53.032 line:95%,end
You guys could have been
a little more receptive to the
bench.

00:08:53.099 --> 00:08:54.133 line:95%,end
It's not for Abby.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.067 line:95%,end
It's not for me.

00:08:55.134 --> 00:08:56.068 line:95%,end
-It's not for the kids.
-Except it says,

00:08:56.135 --> 00:08:58.538 line:95%,end
-"To Abby Lee, Love, Jill and
Kendall. -JILL: It's for
everybody.

00:08:59.038 --> 00:09:00.573 line:95%,end
-Because you guys pick on me.
-CHRISTI: I think you should--

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.141 line:95%,end
'Cause you push me out.

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:03.576 line:95%,end
-That's what you want.
-I think because you're a diva,

00:09:03.643 --> 00:09:04.577 line:95%,end
-table for one.
-Oh.

00:09:04.644 --> 00:09:06.045 line:95%,end
Table for one diva

00:09:06.112 --> 00:09:07.713 line:95%,end
-doesn't give people things...
-Right.

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:10.016 line:95%,end
-JILL: ...and do things for
others. -Diva table for one
gives--

00:09:10.082 --> 00:09:11.284 line:95%,end
You would know
what that's about.

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:12.518 line:95%,end
-I don't.
-CHRISTI: Oh, no.

00:09:12.585 --> 00:09:14.720 line:95%,end
Because I don't have to buy
my way through life, Jill.

00:09:14.787 --> 00:09:16.622 line:95%,end
<i>Jill thinks that she</i>
<i>can just buy Abby off</i>

00:09:16.689 --> 00:09:18.024 line:95%,end
<i>and get Kendall</i>
<i>special treatment.</i>

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:19.525 line:95%,end
<i>That drives me crazy.</i>

00:09:19.592 --> 00:09:21.193 line:95%,end
Chloe works hard every day

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.129 line:95%,end
and she never gets
special treatment from Abby.

00:09:23.195 --> 00:09:24.363 line:95%,end
And she deserves it.

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:25.498 line:95%,end
Why don't you storm out?

00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:26.933 line:95%,end
Because we'd like to
talk about you now.

00:09:26.999 --> 00:09:28.935 line:95%,end
-(woman laughs)
-Oh, whatever you want to say,

00:09:29.001 --> 00:09:30.202 line:95%,end
say right in front of my face.

00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:32.238 line:95%,end
I think you're a
conniving bitch.

00:09:32.305 --> 00:09:34.106 line:95%,end
-I don't have to sit here--
-You're so immature.

00:09:34.173 --> 00:09:36.208 line:95%,end
-It doesn't hurt me one bit.
-Oh, my God! I'm immature?

00:09:36.275 --> 00:09:38.244 line:95%,end
-JILL: Yes.
-You are the most condescending
person

00:09:38.311 --> 00:09:40.146 line:95%,end
I've ever encountered.

00:09:40.212 --> 00:09:41.914 line:95%,end
-You are.
-Then you don't get out much,

00:09:41.981 --> 00:09:43.883 line:95%,end
-but we know that.
-Huh? I don't need to--

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:46.052 line:95%,end
oh, you better stop right there.

what is done is a little hokey.

-CHRISTI: May the force be with
you. -(chuckles)

00:11:05.097 --> 00:11:06.966 line:95%,end
All right. I'm going
to dismiss them.

00:11:07.033 --> 00:11:08.467 line:95%,end
Kendall, stay in here.

00:11:08.901 --> 00:11:10.970 line:95%,end
Yeah. Come here.
I want to see you for a second.

00:11:11.037 --> 00:11:12.805 line:95%,end
I gave Kendall a special part.

00:11:12.872 --> 00:11:15.007 line:95%,end
But now, she's
getting sloppy with it

00:11:15.074 --> 00:11:16.509 line:95%,end
and she's forgetting
what she's doing.

00:11:16.575 --> 00:11:18.978 line:95%,end
You can't be Mommy,
the shoulder to cry on.

00:11:19.045 --> 00:11:20.813 line:95%,end
You need to be as tough as Abby.

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.548 line:95%,end
These legs cut to be straight.

00:11:22.615 --> 00:11:23.849 line:95%,end
Yeah. I--I agree.

00:11:23.916 --> 00:11:25.985 line:95%,end
ABBY: You need to get this kid
down in her split.

00:11:26.052 --> 00:11:27.820 line:95%,end
You need to make sure
those legs are straight.

00:11:27.887 --> 00:11:29.321 line:95%,end
And you need to watch her.

00:11:29.388 --> 00:11:30.990 line:95%,end
Make sure those steps
are squared off.

00:11:31.057 --> 00:11:32.692 line:95%,end
Get that front leg
up on the step,

00:11:32.758 --> 00:11:34.126 line:95%,end
and get her butt down there.

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:36.395 line:95%,end
We're good. She'll do it.

00:11:36.462 --> 00:11:37.563 line:95%,end
You can count on her.

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:38.464 line:95%,end
Thank you.

00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:41.434 line:95%,end
JILL: <i>I need Kendall</i>

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:44.403 line:5%,start
If it takes getting her
her own little private on it,

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:45.838 line:95%,end

00:11:45.905 --> 00:11:47.173 line:95%,end

Let me see what we
have from the top.

I hope you remember it.

The trio this week
entitled <i>Over and Over,</i>

00:11:57.583 --> 00:11:59.418 line:95%,end
is a contemporary piece.

00:11:59.485 --> 00:12:02.021 line:95%,end
Now, the girls learn this dance
months ago.

00:12:02.088 --> 00:12:04.123 line:95%,end
So this should just
be a refresher course

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:06.158 line:95%,end
for Chloe, Paige, and Maddie.

ABBY: Okay, stop.

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:13.933 line:95%,end
Paige, look in the mirror

00:12:13.999 --> 00:12:15.367 line:95%,end
where Maddie's hands are.

00:12:15.434 --> 00:12:17.169 line:95%,end
Why can't you figure that out?

00:12:17.236 --> 00:12:19.305 line:95%,end
Why can't you look in
the mirror and say,

00:12:19.371 --> 00:12:20.806 line:95%,end
"One of us is different"?

00:12:20.873 --> 00:12:22.942 line:95%,end

00:12:23.008 --> 00:12:24.343 line:95%,end
ABBY: Paige, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:26.412 line:95%,end
Where is that foot?
In passÃ©, coupÃ©?

00:12:26.479 --> 00:12:28.414 line:95%,end
You're too old
for these little corrections.

00:12:28.481 --> 00:12:29.315 line:95%,end
Goodness.

00:12:29.381 --> 00:12:32.251 line:95%,end
<i>I thought that putting Paige</i>
<i>on top of the pyramid</i>

00:12:32.318 --> 00:12:34.186 line:95%,end
<i>would build up her self-esteem,</i>

00:12:34.253 --> 00:12:36.489 line:95%,end
that-that would give that kid
a shot in the arm

00:12:36.555 --> 00:12:39.191 line:95%,end
that she needed to
get her act together.

00:12:39.258 --> 00:12:40.259 line:95%,end
Big mistake.

00:12:40.326 --> 00:12:41.927 line:95%,end
I've have had it with you!

00:12:42.194 --> 00:12:43.395 line:95%,end
What is she saying?

00:12:43.462 --> 00:12:45.998 line:95%,end
You didn't show up
for a whole month to take class!

00:12:46.065 --> 00:12:47.900 line:95%,end
Your mother sits out
there and screams!

00:12:47.967 --> 00:12:49.435 line:95%,end
You know she won't say it to me

00:12:49.502 --> 00:12:51.070 line:95%,end
because she's a chicken (bleep).

00:12:51.137 --> 00:12:53.139 line:95%,end
She has to say to
somebody who's 10.

00:12:53.205 --> 00:12:55.040 line:95%,end
ABBY: You should have remembered
that trio.

00:12:55.808 --> 00:12:56.776 line:95%,end
Ridiculous.

00:12:56.842 --> 00:12:58.477 line:95%,end
Hit play. Make 'em do it again.

00:12:58.878 --> 00:13:00.079 line:95%,end

00:13:02.414 --> 00:13:03.783 line:95%,end
<i>She was my dance teacher,</i>

00:13:03.849 --> 00:13:06.485 line:5%,start
so I understand how
she's hard on dancers.

00:13:06.552 --> 00:13:07.820 line:5%,start
But, as a mom,

00:13:07.887 --> 00:13:09.522 line:95%,end
it's hard whenever
you're watching

00:13:09.588 --> 00:13:10.790 line:95%,end
your kid down there crying.

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:13.826 line:95%,end
Excuse me.
Paige, can you come here,
please?

00:13:16.562 --> 00:13:18.030 line:95%,end
ABBY: She's done. Done.

00:13:18.097 --> 00:13:20.599 line:95%,end
Stupid is stupid does,
and I can't stand it anymore.

00:13:20.666 --> 00:13:21.734 line:95%,end
It's ridiculous.

00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:23.235 line:95%,end
There we go again with Kelly--

00:13:23.302 --> 00:13:25.004 line:95%,end
bad parenting.

00:13:25.471 --> 00:13:27.973 line:95%,end
Even a preschool mother knows

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.708 line:95%,end
you don't come downstairs.

00:13:29.775 --> 00:13:31.277 line:95%,end
You don't open the door.

00:13:31.343 --> 00:13:33.145 line:95%,end
You let the teacher handle it.

00:13:33.212 --> 00:13:34.346 line:95%,end
Why do you let her bother you?

00:13:34.413 --> 00:13:35.915 line:95%,end
I just don't get it.

00:13:35.981 --> 00:13:37.216 line:95%,end
Just--who cares?

00:13:37.283 --> 00:13:38.818 line:95%,end
Look at her and be like,

00:13:38.884 --> 00:13:40.486 line:95%,end
"Who cares, Miss Abby?"

00:13:40.553 --> 00:13:41.520 line:95%,end

<i>That's how I want her to be.</i>

00:13:44.456 --> 00:13:46.525 line:95%,end
And Abby flips out
because she's crying.

00:13:47.193 --> 00:13:48.494 line:95%,end
You know, she's
not professional.

00:13:48.561 --> 00:13:50.196 line:95%,end
Well, no, she's
not professional.

00:13:50.262 --> 00:13:52.498 line:95%,end
She's a 10-year-old little girl
at dance class.


00:13:52.565 --> 00:13:53.632 line:95%,end
Do you not want to do it?

00:13:53.699 --> 00:13:54.967 line:95%,end
No, I do, but... (sobs)

00:13:55.034 --> 00:13:56.035 line:95%,end
KELLY: Okay.

00:13:56.468 --> 00:13:58.103 line:95%,end
...but she's gonna be mad at me.

00:13:58.170 --> 00:13:59.538 line:95%,end
Get control of yourself

00:13:59.605 --> 00:14:00.840 line:95%,end
and go ahead in.

00:14:00.906 --> 00:14:02.374 line:95%,end
And if she says you're done,

00:14:02.441 --> 00:14:04.276 line:95%,end
walk out and I'll walk in.

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:07.780 line:95%,end
<i>-It's not worth it. It's a</i>

If she tells you
to leave, then say,

00:14:09.515 --> 00:14:10.649 line:95%,end
"You know what? Good.

00:14:10.716 --> 00:14:12.418 line:95%,end
Give it to somebody
else to learn."

You okay?

-Don't you let her win.
-You're bigger than her.

00:14:19.792 --> 00:14:20.626 line:95%,end
-Not by size...
-Yeah.

00:14:20.693 --> 00:14:22.228 line:95%,end
...but you're--you're
better than her.

00:14:22.294 --> 00:14:23.329 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: It's your trio.

00:14:23.395 --> 00:14:24.830 line:95%,end
Don't you let her
kick you out of it.

00:14:25.297 --> 00:14:26.465 line:95%,end
-All right. Go ahead.
-Go ahead, Paige.

00:14:26.532 --> 00:14:27.733 line:95%,end
Take a breath. This is your--

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.268 line:95%,end
Paige, this is your dance.

00:14:33.505 --> 00:14:34.773 line:95%,end
<i>I don't like when</i>

because it makes us
feel really nervous.

00:14:37.142 --> 00:14:38.711 line:5%,start
And if we do it wrong,

00:14:38.777 --> 00:14:40.045 line:95%,end
we're going to
get it. (chuckles)

00:14:40.112 --> 00:14:42.381 line:95%,end
ABBY: Hollywood Vibe

00:14:42.448 --> 00:14:44.216 line:95%,end
So suck it up and
don't leave again,

00:14:44.283 --> 00:14:45.951 line:95%,end

8 would be the second,

00:14:57.863 --> 00:14:59.765 line:95%,end

Whew.

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:04.870 line:95%,end
This is a routine they learned
three months ago.

00:15:04.937 --> 00:15:07.706 line:95%,end
They didn't forget it
all because they're kids.

00:15:07.773 --> 00:15:10.643 line:95%,end
They forgot it

dancers.

00:15:10.709 --> 00:15:11.977 line:95%,end
<i>They screwed up.</i>

00:15:12.044 --> 00:15:14.680 line:95%,end

Chloe, don't cry. Be smarter!

00:15:20.252 --> 00:15:23.222 line:95%,end
8 means 8, not 9
and 1/2, not 10. 8!

Can't count to 8?

00:15:26.225 --> 00:15:28.027 line:95%,end
She's not even listening
to what I'm saying.

00:15:28.093 --> 00:15:29.328 line:95%,end
Think about Hollywood Vibe.

00:15:29.395 --> 00:15:31.797 line:95%,end
Because I can call them right
now and try to get our money
back

00:15:31.864 --> 00:15:32.798 line:95%,end
if you don't want to go.

00:15:33.565 --> 00:15:35.000 line:95%,end
Because I'm not
going to go there

00:15:35.067 --> 00:15:36.835 line:95%,end

00:15:46.278 --> 00:15:47.413 line:95%,end
No!

00:15:47.479 --> 00:15:49.481 line:95%,end

So you're done. Go ahead.

Yes.

face. They're distracted.

They don't know what--
their right from their left.

They can't count to eight.

Girls, I don't need the tears!

You're nine, ten and
eleven years old.

screaming

You should be so lucky to have
Chloe is your student.

it except for you.

her!

00:17:15.567 --> 00:17:18.203 line:95%,end
Because you are too busy
looking at everybody else!

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:19.605 line:95%,end
Oh, who else was I looking at?

00:17:29.314 --> 00:17:30.549 line:5%,start
And it is a shame.

(tense music playing)

00:17:31.984 --> 00:17:33.585 line:95%,end
Disrespectful.

00:17:33.652 --> 00:17:36.021 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: You're like, the
definition of disrespectful.

00:17:36.088 --> 00:17:37.356 line:95%,end
Well, my mother
would have came in

00:17:37.423 --> 00:17:39.858 line:95%,end

00:17:40.759 --> 00:17:42.528 line:95%,end
She would have been mortified!

00:17:43.562 --> 00:17:44.596 line:95%,end
White trash.

Move up stage!

00:17:54.973 --> 00:17:57.242 line:5%,start
After the big blow up
with Abby last night,

00:17:57.309 --> 00:17:58.477 line:5%,start
you know, everyone went home.

00:17:58.544 --> 00:17:59.511 line:95%,end
They got a good night's rest.

00:17:59.578 --> 00:18:00.479 line:95%,end
We tried to refocus.

<i>Because talking to Abby</i>

00:18:01.847 --> 00:18:03.082 line:95%,end
is like talking to a brick wall.

00:18:03.148 --> 00:18:04.917 line:95%,end
I might as well
just save my breath.

CHRISTI: Oh, look, there's guns.

00:18:12.424 --> 00:18:14.860 line:95%,end
At this point, with the guns,

00:18:14.927 --> 00:18:16.795 line:95%,end
I hope we go and we
get disqualified,

00:18:16.862 --> 00:18:18.464 line:95%,end
just to piss Abby off.

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:21.900 line:95%,end
MADDIE: <i>I know the difference</i>
<i>between a fake gun and a real</i>
<i>gun.</i>

00:18:21.967 --> 00:18:25.804 line:95%,end
And I would never
touch a real gun.

00:18:25.871 --> 00:18:29.007 line:5%,start
But since we're using it in a
dance, as a prop,

00:18:29.074 --> 00:18:30.476 line:5%,start
I'm fine with it.

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:32.878 line:95%,end
Be strong with that gun!

00:18:37.783 --> 00:18:40.285 line:5%,start
And then she said we were going
to blow the competition away.

00:18:41.019 --> 00:18:42.121 line:95%,end
And I don't--I--

I really hope she
doesn't mean literally.

Because we could
get disqualified.

00:18:46.325 --> 00:18:48.360 line:95%,end

not a good idea.

00:18:49.895 --> 00:18:51.563 line:95%,end
<i>I think the choice</i>

00:18:53.665 --> 00:18:54.967 line:95%,end

00:18:55.033 --> 00:18:57.069 line:95%,end
<i>I think the dance</i>

00:18:57.136 --> 00:18:59.538 line:5%,start
I just don't think
it's appropriate for girls, or
any child,

00:18:59.605 --> 00:19:00.939 line:5%,start
to be playing with
guns on stage.

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:03.742 line:95%,end
Oh. That's where they were,
the yellow and the pink.

00:19:03.809 --> 00:19:05.511 line:95%,end
All right. What's going on,
ladies? Because I got to run.

00:19:05.577 --> 00:19:07.012 line:95%,end
We've been watching the dance.

00:19:07.079 --> 00:19:09.014 line:95%,end
And I know you're going to say
we're not dance teachers

00:19:09.081 --> 00:19:10.215 line:95%,end
and we're moms.

00:19:10.282 --> 00:19:12.684 line:95%,end
But I know you want
to win this weekend.

00:19:12.751 --> 00:19:15.220 line:95%,end
The caliber of the piece--

00:19:15.287 --> 00:19:17.256 line:95%,end
it doesn't seem as high

00:19:17.322 --> 00:19:19.925 line:95%,end
as what you normally put out
there for the girls.

00:19:19.992 --> 00:19:22.161 line:95%,end
I think the guns
are also--as moms,

00:19:22.227 --> 00:19:24.296 line:95%,end
it's throwing us off a bit.
It seems a bit aggressive.

00:19:24.363 --> 00:19:26.064 line:95%,end
I've done children with guns,

00:19:26.131 --> 00:19:27.299 line:95%,end
and it won everything.

00:19:27.366 --> 00:19:28.934 line:95%,end
It was a piece of
brilliant work.

I want to do high energy.

00:22:38.724 --> 00:22:39.658 line:95%,end
Are you kidding me?

CHRISTI:
Well, but you're saying what did
I do

00:22:41.026 --> 00:22:41.960 line:95%,end
or what did my daughter do.

00:22:42.027 --> 00:22:42.861 line:95%,end
Well, you threw a shoe

00:22:42.928 --> 00:22:44.896 line:95%,end

at the bottom of the pyramid.

00:22:44.963 --> 00:22:47.699 line:95%,end

my daughter wouldn't
have even been on the pyramid.

00:22:49.735 --> 00:22:51.236 line:95%,end
She would have been on the floor

00:22:51.303 --> 00:22:52.604 line:95%,end
snuffing out like a cigarette.

Go away, Chloe, go away.

They have very little
time to waste it.

00:23:03.348 --> 00:23:07.452 line:95%,end

Come on!

Yes?

00:23:20.432 --> 00:23:22.401 line:95%,end

how a trio works.

Do you see what they're doing?

00:23:23.535 --> 00:23:25.003 line:95%,end
Play it right there.

00:23:25.237 --> 00:23:28.507 line:95%,end
The problem is, is that
if you interrupt this class

00:23:28.573 --> 00:23:29.975 line:95%,end
she's going to be livid.

00:23:30.041 --> 00:23:33.378 line:95%,end

get my child out of there...

00:23:33.445 --> 00:23:34.413 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Mm-hmm.

00:23:34.479 --> 00:23:35.714 line:95%,end
...and do something productive,

00:23:35.781 --> 00:23:37.182 line:95%,end
-whether it's dance...
-Mm-hmm.

00:23:37.249 --> 00:23:38.984 line:95%,end
...which is what I pay Abby for,

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:40.886 line:95%,end
or her homework.

00:23:40.952 --> 00:23:42.454 line:95%,end
I just--I think
that's going to--

00:23:42.521 --> 00:23:43.855 line:95%,end
I think that's gonna backfire.

00:23:43.922 --> 00:23:46.091 line:95%,end
JILL: <i>I can't believe</i>

00:23:47.859 --> 00:23:49.361 line:95%,end
I should not have
these feelings.

00:23:49.428 --> 00:23:53.198 line:95%,end
I should be able to go down

00:23:53.265 --> 00:23:54.699 line:95%,end
without all kinds of drama.

00:23:54.766 --> 00:23:56.401 line:95%,end

going to happen.

ABBY: All right.
Play it right there.

00:24:00.639 --> 00:24:02.240 line:95%,end

Kendall could be

00:24:02.307 --> 00:24:04.976 line:95%,end
more productive
doing her homework.

00:24:05.043 --> 00:24:06.411 line:95%,end
ABBY: She's the swing
for this number.

00:24:06.478 --> 00:24:07.579 line:95%,end
It's been an hour, Abby,

00:24:07.646 --> 00:24:09.114 line:95%,end

sitting on the floor.

ABBY: She's helping me.

00:24:10.215 --> 00:24:11.817 line:95%,end
JILL: Abby, I want her to dance.

00:24:11.883 --> 00:24:13.518 line:95%,end
I don't pay tuition
for her to be out here

00:24:13.585 --> 00:24:15.120 line:95%,end
sitting on the floor.

00:24:15.187 --> 00:24:18.190 line:95%,end
I want you to
teach her to dance.

00:24:18.256 --> 00:24:20.292 line:95%,end
All those things you
said to me yesterday,

00:24:20.358 --> 00:24:23.028 line:95%,end
she needs to work on her
stretch, her this, her turns,

00:24:23.495 --> 00:24:24.963 line:95%,end
why are you not teaching her?

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:26.231 line:95%,end
Why aren't you
helping her with this?

00:24:26.298 --> 00:24:28.366 line:95%,end
Well, because I'm
choreographing a trio, Jill.

00:24:28.433 --> 00:24:31.403 line:95%,end
Okay. So how much longer do you
think this trio is going to
take?

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:33.038 line:95%,end
Because it's been
over an hour now.

00:24:33.104 --> 00:24:34.005 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Is she yelling?

00:24:34.072 --> 00:24:35.373 line:95%,end
Jill's yelling?

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:37.742 line:95%,end
She took her 900 voice
off for Abby now.

00:24:37.809 --> 00:24:39.177 line:95%,end
She flushed that down the
toilet, that voice.

00:24:39.244 --> 00:24:40.245 line:95%,end
She doesn't do it anymore.

00:24:40.312 --> 00:24:41.146 line:95%,end
Yes, she does.

00:24:41.213 --> 00:24:42.881 line:95%,end
She still says...
(whispering) "Guys..."

00:24:42.948 --> 00:24:44.916 line:95%,end
We come to dance to dance.

00:24:44.983 --> 00:24:47.752 line:95%,end

-Go.

I don't want to see
anything bad happen to her

Maddie, every step you take,
make sure that ankle is pressed
forward.

Get those knees together

They couldn't even remember
the choreography in class.

She's been working

She was at the bottom

00:31:36.561 --> 00:31:38.263 line:95%,end

There was a big gap there.

You were a little late
on those coupÃ© turns.

00:32:18.636 --> 00:32:20.271 line:95%,end

take responsibility.

00:32:23.041 --> 00:32:24.609 line:5%,start
It's always somebody
else's fault.

00:32:24.676 --> 00:32:27.545 line:5%,start
Either it's the girl's fault
or it's the mom's fault.

00:32:27.612 --> 00:32:29.614 line:95%,end
It's anybody's fault but Abby's.

00:32:29.681 --> 00:32:32.583 line:95%,end
You at least got to give
some positive to those kids.

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:34.919 line:95%,end
I just don't like
enabling kids to keep...

00:32:35.987 --> 00:32:37.855 line:95%,end
Abby, I support that.

00:32:37.922 --> 00:32:42.961 line:95%,end
But I think you can prepare kids
to take ownership of mistakes

00:32:43.027 --> 00:32:44.095 line:95%,end
without belittling
them. Kids should--

00:32:44.162 --> 00:32:45.396 line:95%,end
But that's not Abby Lee Miller.

00:32:45.463 --> 00:32:46.431 line:95%,end
Kids should--I know, but Abby--

00:32:46.497 --> 00:32:47.432 line:95%,end
That's not my way.

00:32:47.498 --> 00:32:48.533 line:95%,end

-with producing professional
dancers... -HOLLY: Absolutely.

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:57.275 line:95%,end

KELLY: Isn't there something,
like, to having hope?

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:16.194 line:95%,end
Like, if you have hopes and
dreams, you work towards them.

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:17.562 line:95%,end
If you keep crushing them down

00:33:17.628 --> 00:33:20.465 line:95%,end
just because your kid
isn't the best turner and this
kid is--

00:33:20.531 --> 00:33:21.866 line:95%,end
if you keep crushing
this one down,

00:33:21.933 --> 00:33:23.301 line:95%,end
they're never going
to become good.

00:33:23.368 --> 00:33:24.736 line:95%,end
If that kid loved to dance,

00:33:24.802 --> 00:33:26.070 line:95%,end
she'd have remembered that trio.

00:33:27.071 --> 00:33:28.039 line:95%,end
Whatever.

Own it.

00:33:37.415 --> 00:33:38.850 line:95%,end
I had a bad day.

00:33:38.916 --> 00:33:39.984 line:95%,end

remember every week

00:33:47.291 --> 00:33:48.459 line:95%,end
and go out there

ABBY: I don't know!
But you know the one I remember?

00:33:50.795 --> 00:33:53.531 line:95%,end
The one where she forgot
her dance on stage at nationals

00:33:53.598 --> 00:33:55.433 line:95%,end
and ran around to music.

00:33:55.833 --> 00:33:57.135 line:95%,end
That's the one I remember.

Just a few. Yeah.

Keeping your tabs
on that old studio.

00:34:15.019 --> 00:34:16.354 line:95%,end
Absolutely. Why?

00:34:16.421 --> 00:34:17.955 line:95%,end
Are you guys not
allowed to, like...

00:34:18.022 --> 00:34:18.923 line:95%,end

That's crazy. Why?

00:34:23.161 --> 00:34:25.163 line:95%,end
She wants to discourage
studio hopping.

00:34:25.229 --> 00:34:27.565 line:5%,start
I am not surprised at all
that she has been in contact

00:34:27.632 --> 00:34:28.599 line:5%,start

That's what Jill does.

She always looks for where
the grass is greener,

00:34:31.536 --> 00:34:33.004 line:95%,end
and that's where she
goes out to pasture.

00:34:33.071 --> 00:34:35.973 line:95%,end
You know what?
Always got to keep your options
open.

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:38.476 line:95%,end

why you were out there

all your old friends,

00:34:39.577 --> 00:34:41.045 line:95%,end

I'm-- -Well, it's my business,

-I don't think so.
-Oh, no, no.

00:34:47.085 --> 00:34:48.486 line:95%,end
It's my business
if you're only here

and go back to your old studio.

00:34:50.421 --> 00:34:52.190 line:95%,end
That's my business
because it affects my daughter.

You guys sit here

complain

00:34:55.159 --> 00:34:57.795 line:95%,end

00:34:57.862 --> 00:34:58.729 line:95%,end
Pick up and move!

00:34:58.796 --> 00:35:00.832 line:95%,end
Maybe you will find
something else.

You really, really, really
like to change studios.

00:35:04.001 --> 00:35:05.169 line:95%,end
So maybe you ought
to change back

00:35:05.236 --> 00:35:06.938 line:95%,end

if it was so great.

00:35:07.004 --> 00:35:08.039 line:95%,end
You know what?

HOLLY: <i>I thought the group</i>

00:37:07.592 --> 00:37:09.627 line:95%,end
They had incredible energy.

00:37:10.027 --> 00:37:12.763 line:95%,end
<i>I wish I could say</i>
<i>I was horrified by the guns,</i>

00:37:12.830 --> 00:37:14.832 line:95%,end

ABBY: <i>I was beaming.</i>


00:37:29.947 --> 00:37:32.216 line:95%,end
I thought they looked
gorgeous on stage.

00:37:32.283 --> 00:37:34.285 line:95%,end
Finally, they had a group number

00:37:34.352 --> 00:37:37.688 line:95%,end
that was dancing
like one person,

00:37:37.755 --> 00:37:40.124 line:95%,end
instead of six different
soloists out there.

00:37:40.825 --> 00:37:44.295 line:5%,start

ANNOUNCER: <i>Congratulations.</i>

00:38:03.214 --> 00:38:06.217 line:5%,start
I was very confident
that the girls would win first
place

00:38:06.284 --> 00:38:07.585 line:95%,end
<i>in the Jazz category.</i>

00:38:07.652 --> 00:38:09.987 line:95%,end
There were lots of other
great numbers there.

00:38:10.054 --> 00:38:12.857 line:95%,end
But they were so clean
and so professional,

00:38:12.923 --> 00:38:14.025 line:95%,end
they had it in the bag.

00:38:14.091 --> 00:38:17.361 line:5%,start
ANNOUNCER: <i>Uh-oh--</i>
<i>Overall High Scoring Group.</i>

00:38:17.428 --> 00:38:21.732 line:5%,start
My hopes are that this group
number wins first overall.

00:38:21.799 --> 00:38:24.502 line:95%,end
<i>And it's time for these girls</i>
<i>to bring home a win.</i>

00:38:24.568 --> 00:38:27.238 line:95%,end
CHLOE: <i>I think the group</i>
<i>number's do-- going to do pretty</i>
<i>good.</i>

00:38:27.505 --> 00:38:29.473 line:5%,start
I mean, we've got guns.

00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:30.641 line:5%,start
What else could go wrong?

00:38:30.708 --> 00:38:35.713 line:95%,end
ANNOUNCER: <i>$200 going out</i>
<i>to act number 22, "War."</i>

(cheers and applause)

00:38:38.115 --> 00:38:40.651 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>The group dance</i>
<i>did not win the overall.</i>

00:38:40.718 --> 00:38:44.422 line:95%,end
I thought for sure,
with the level of difficulty,

00:38:44.488 --> 00:38:46.257 line:95%,end
that they were going to win
that. And they didn't.

00:38:47.124 --> 00:38:48.559 line:95%,end
Hey, hey.

00:38:48.626 --> 00:38:49.727 line:95%,end
Hi.

00:38:49.794 --> 00:38:51.429 line:95%,end
Did you see that gold on that
stage? It just--

00:38:51.495 --> 00:38:52.330 line:95%,end
-JILL: Gorgeous.
-It popped.

00:38:52.396 --> 00:38:55.299 line:95%,end
I didn't think it had it
all together at the beginning of
the week.

00:38:55.366 --> 00:38:57.468 line:95%,end
-And seeing it on stage...
-Oh, they were fabulous.

00:38:57.535 --> 00:38:58.869 line:95%,end
...I have to admit I was wrong.

00:38:58.936 --> 00:38:59.970 line:95%,end
ABBY: They looked
like they were in a show.

00:39:00.037 --> 00:39:01.339 line:95%,end
It was great.
-It was really good.

00:39:01.405 --> 00:39:02.573 line:95%,end
Don't your stomachs get full

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:05.176 line:95%,end
eating crow week
after week after week?

00:39:05.242 --> 00:39:07.378 line:95%,end
JILL: I thought the number
looked great on stage.

00:39:07.445 --> 00:39:09.180 line:95%,end
But maybe if you did more turn--

00:39:09.246 --> 00:39:11.215 line:95%,end
more group turns
made it so dynamic.

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:14.752 line:95%,end
I just think that
this group of kids

00:39:14.819 --> 00:39:17.421 line:95%,end
were not all used
to their fullest potential.

00:39:17.488 --> 00:39:18.823 line:95%,end
Maybe Maddie was.

00:39:18.889 --> 00:39:21.792 line:95%,end
I know for a fact Kendall
wasn't used to her fullest
potential.

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.929 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>Jill is certainly</i>
<i>not learning from her mistakes.</i>

00:39:24.995 --> 00:39:29.467 line:95%,end
She comes at me in a combative
way, rips on my choreography.

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:33.337 line:95%,end
Jill, butt out,
follow the rules,

00:39:33.404 --> 00:39:35.005 line:95%,end
and let me work with Kendall.

00:39:35.072 --> 00:39:37.842 line:95%,end
JILL: You were all excited
to give her a special part,

00:39:37.908 --> 00:39:39.844 line:95%,end
and there was no special part.

00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:42.880 line:95%,end
She did what everybody else did,
and less than some.

00:39:42.947 --> 00:39:45.116 line:95%,end
I think Jill's idea
of a special part

00:39:45.683 --> 00:39:48.953 line:95%,end
is everybody else stands
on stage and poses,

00:39:49.019 --> 00:39:50.721 line:95%,end
then Kendall dances
in the middle.

00:39:50.788 --> 00:39:53.758 line:95%,end
ABBY: Jill, Kendall
is a beautiful girl.

00:39:53.824 --> 00:39:55.359 line:95%,end
She picks up very quick.

00:39:55.893 --> 00:39:57.461 line:95%,end
Does she need technique? Yes.

00:39:57.528 --> 00:39:59.230 line:95%,end
Do all of them? Yes.

00:39:59.296 --> 00:40:01.065 line:95%,end
That's a growing process.

00:40:01.132 --> 00:40:03.300 line:95%,end
It takes years to develop.

00:40:03.367 --> 00:40:05.770 line:95%,end
And I don't think you should
run your studio like that.

00:40:08.839 --> 00:40:12.243 line:95%,end
I produce employable,

00:40:12.309 --> 00:40:15.913 line:95%,end
working dancers, not
competition kids.

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:18.849 line:95%,end
You need to keep your eye on the
ball in the big picture.

00:40:18.916 --> 00:40:20.217 line:95%,end
What is my big picture?

00:40:20.284 --> 00:40:23.087 line:95%,end
Every weekend,
do I have to look forward to
coming,

00:40:23.154 --> 00:40:25.222 line:5%,start
dancing behind Maddie and Chloe,

00:40:25.289 --> 00:40:28.426 line:5%,start
and never being put in a trio,
never doing the solo?

00:40:28.492 --> 00:40:29.960 line:5%,start
I get nothing, Abby!

00:40:30.027 --> 00:40:32.029 line:5%,start
You're telling me look
at the big picture.

00:40:32.096 --> 00:40:33.697 line:5%,start
And I am, and I don't like it!

00:40:33.764 --> 00:40:34.799 line:5%,start
ABBY: <i>I don't know.</i>

00:40:34.865 --> 00:40:36.700 line:5%,start
I don't know what
is wrong with her.

00:40:37.067 --> 00:40:39.270 line:5%,start
<i>It's going to all shake out</i>
<i>in the wash for Kendall,</i>

00:40:39.336 --> 00:40:40.971 line:5%,start
but I don't know if she's
going to make it that long.

00:40:41.038 --> 00:40:44.074 line:5%,start
Because the mother is
out to destroy her.

00:40:44.141 --> 00:40:45.810 line:5%,start
Give her a solo, Abby!

00:40:45.876 --> 00:40:47.077 line:5%,start
Let her do a trio!

00:40:47.144 --> 00:40:47.978 line:5%,start
Give her something!

00:40:48.045 --> 00:40:49.280 line:5%,start
ABBY: Don't worry.

00:40:49.346 --> 00:40:51.449 line:5%,start
I have something
perfect in mind for you.
