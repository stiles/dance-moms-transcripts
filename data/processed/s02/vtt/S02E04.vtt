00:00:10.377 --> 00:00:12.579 line:5%,start
The Abby Lee Dance Company, boo.

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:13.480 line:5%,start
Where's Brooke?

00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:15.015 line:5%,start
I don't think she's coming this weekend.

You're dismissed, you're dismissed.

There will be no group dance this week.

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:19.152 line:5%,start
That's it.

I'm not talking to you today.

I don't think she's replacing Paige.

00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:34.367 line:5%,start
She just did.

ABBY: I expect more from you.

What kind of parenting is that?

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:40.807 line:5%,start
If you do good in that trio,
this 20 bucks is yours.

Don't you say that to my daughter!

Be a role model!

<i>She came in here,</i>

ABBY: You won.

00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:23.783 line:95%,end
However, I see things that I need to fix.

00:01:24.617 --> 00:01:27.487 line:95%,end
Paige, you were okay in the group,
but you know that you messed up

00:01:27.554 --> 00:01:29.656 line:95%,end
that whole leap downstage.

00:01:32.892 --> 00:01:36.563 line:95%,end
Kendall, on the grand jete,
you did it crossing to the right.

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:39.032 line:95%,end
So we couldn't see
if the hips were in line or not.

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:43.036 line:95%,end
Nia, you did a great job
in the group dance.

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:45.038 line:95%,end
You did not pull my eyes negatively,

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:48.641 line:95%,end
but I want you to start pulling
my eyes positively.

00:01:48.708 --> 00:01:51.511 line:95%,end
This week we are attending
Hollywood Vibe.

00:01:51.578 --> 00:01:53.546 line:95%,end
Those judges, and the directors,

00:01:53.613 --> 00:01:54.948 line:95%,end
and everybody that runs Hollywood Vibe,

00:01:55.014 --> 00:01:57.984 line:95%,end
they are from LA,
or they are from New York City.

00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:02.055 line:95%,end
They are looking
for the next big thing, the next star,

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:05.592 line:95%,end
the next little kid to be in their video
or their commercial,

00:02:05.658 --> 00:02:07.494 line:95%,end
so you need to bring the A game.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.428 line:95%,end
Moms?

CHRISTI: I expect nothing less
from Abby Lee Miller than putting

00:02:12.198 --> 00:02:14.734 line:95%,end
<i>an exorbitant amount of pressure</i>

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:16.136 line:95%,end
That's what she does.

On to the pyramid.

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.038 line:95%,end
(tense music playing)

00:02:19.105 --> 00:02:21.174 line:95%,end
I'm not even going to discuss this.

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:25.078 line:95%,end
I'm moving on to Paige.

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:27.747 line:95%,end
<i>The reason Paige</i>
<i>is on the bottom of the pyramid</i>

00:02:27.814 --> 00:02:30.750 line:5%,start
is because she just
does not apply corrections.

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:32.652 line:95%,end
You're going to have to work
back up that ladder.

00:02:33.853 --> 00:02:36.356 line:95%,end
Next I have Nia.

00:02:36.422 --> 00:02:37.624 line:95%,end
You've been working very hard,

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.126 line:95%,end
but you still have to fix
those technical issues.

00:02:40.193 --> 00:02:41.194 line:95%,end
Kendall.

00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:43.229 line:95%,end
Kendall, you are still on probation.

00:02:43.296 --> 00:02:45.198 line:95%,end
Mom, it's a long process.

00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:46.666 line:95%,end
-(laughter)
-Oh, my God.

00:02:46.733 --> 00:02:48.968 line:5%,start
Why is Kendall still on probation?

00:02:49.035 --> 00:02:51.271 line:95%,end
<i>It's making me crazy.</i>

00:02:51.337 --> 00:02:53.406 line:95%,end
Mackenzie.

00:02:53.473 --> 00:02:56.342 line:95%,end
you were the overall high school winner
of the primary age division.

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:59.012 line:95%,end
You proved yourself in the group
with Apples,

00:02:59.078 --> 00:03:01.447 line:95%,end
and you proved your solo.

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:02.982 line:5%,start
I knew I could get higher
in the pyramid,

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.251 line:5%,start
because I did great last week.

00:03:05.318 --> 00:03:06.619 line:95%,end
ABBY: Maddie.

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:08.121 line:95%,end
Maddie, I thought
you did a great job

00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:09.689 line:95%,end
in the group and your solo.

00:03:09.756 --> 00:03:11.457 line:95%,end
Well, keep working.

00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:13.259 line:95%,end
You need something to work for.

00:03:13.326 --> 00:03:15.662 line:95%,end
And on top of the pyramid this week,
Chloe.

00:03:15.728 --> 00:03:16.729 line:95%,end
(applause)

00:03:16.796 --> 00:03:18.097 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>Chloe had to be</i>
<i>on top of the pyramid.</i>

00:03:18.164 --> 00:03:19.232 line:95%,end
<i>She was the overall high score winner,</i>

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.268 line:95%,end
<i>and that's usually the person</i>
<i>that's in that key position.</i>

00:03:22.335 --> 00:03:25.438 line:95%,end
It will be, you know,
up to Chloe if she stays

00:03:25.505 --> 00:03:27.006 line:95%,end
<i>in that position or not.</i>

00:03:27.073 --> 00:03:29.842 line:95%,end
You did something out there,
you made your mother cry,


00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:31.044 line:95%,end
she was bawling.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.013 line:95%,end
Don't make me cry, make me smile.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.748 line:95%,end
I think this is a little hard on Melissa.

00:03:35.815 --> 00:03:37.450 line:95%,end
<i>Chloe is above Maddie on the pyramid.</i>

00:03:37.517 --> 00:03:39.452 line:95%,end
<i>So it's like celebration day.</i>

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:40.920 line:95%,end
Ice cream for everyone.

00:03:40.987 --> 00:03:43.223 line:95%,end
ABBY:
This week in Hollywood Vibe, Chloe,

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:44.924 line:95%,end
you will be doing a solo again.

00:03:44.991 --> 00:03:47.093 line:95%,end
Maddie, you will also be doing a solo.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.495 line:95%,end
And we're going to do a trio,

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:53.967 line:95%,end
and the trio is going to be Chloe, Maddie,

00:03:54.767 --> 00:03:56.769 line:95%,end
and--

00:03:56.836 --> 00:03:59.639 line:95%,end
(tense music playing)

00:04:00.873 --> 00:04:02.141 line:95%,end
Kendall.

00:04:05.311 --> 00:04:08.948 line:5%,start
PAIGE: As a dancer,
I've been in this trio since I was four.

00:04:09.015 --> 00:04:10.216 line:95%,end
<i>I think I should be in the trio,</i>

00:04:10.283 --> 00:04:13.953 line:95%,end
<i>and I think because Miss Abby's mad</i>
<i>at Brooke and my mom</i>

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.622 line:95%,end
that she's taking it out on me.

00:04:15.688 --> 00:04:18.358 line:95%,end
ABBY: Kendall, you stepped it up
from Apple's last week.

00:04:18.424 --> 00:04:23.029 line:95%,end
But now I need to see
if you can hang with Chloe and Maddie.

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:25.698 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>I am not mad because</i>
<i>Kendall was put in the dance.</i>

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:27.800 line:5%,start
I know that Abby is doing it

00:04:27.867 --> 00:04:30.837 line:95%,end
<i>because she wants to hurt me</i>
<i>and hurt my kid.</i>

00:04:30.903 --> 00:04:33.006 line:95%,end
Let me talk about the group dance.

00:04:33.072 --> 00:04:35.441 line:95%,end
It's a contemporary lyrical routine.

00:04:35.508 --> 00:04:37.310 line:95%,end
I am putting art on the stage.

00:04:37.377 --> 00:04:40.980 line:95%,end
It's going to be about a bully.

00:04:41.047 --> 00:04:43.383 line:95%,end
MADDIE: <i>The group number this week</i>
<i>is about bullying,</i>

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:47.920 line:5%,start
and I actually have got bullied
before on my bus.

00:04:47.987 --> 00:04:50.790 line:95%,end
And I've also seen a lot
of bullying at my school.

00:04:50.857 --> 00:04:53.526 line:95%,end
There needs to be somebody
that's the bully.

00:04:53.593 --> 00:04:57.497 line:5%,start
HOLLY: I think it's incredibly ironic
that Abby's choice of dance

00:04:57.563 --> 00:05:00.300 line:5%,start
is about bullying considering
her methods of teaching.

00:05:00.366 --> 00:05:02.869 line:95%,end
ABBY:
Nia, you are going to be the bully.

00:05:02.935 --> 00:05:04.771 line:95%,end
Somebody has to be the bad guy.

00:05:04.837 --> 00:05:05.772 line:95%,end
(laughter)

00:05:05.838 --> 00:05:07.106 line:95%,end
GIRL: I can't imagine that.

00:05:07.173 --> 00:05:08.708 line:95%,end
ABBY: But she's an actress,
she has to act.

00:05:08.775 --> 00:05:09.909 line:95%,end
WOMAN: She's right, it's acting.

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:11.711 line:95%,end
ABBY: So you're going to be my bully.

00:05:11.778 --> 00:05:13.179 line:95%,end
-Yes?
-Okay.

00:05:13.246 --> 00:05:15.615 line:5%,start
I'm so happy, because this Abby chose me

00:05:15.682 --> 00:05:18.951 line:5%,start
to be the one that's starring
in the group dance this week.

00:05:19.018 --> 00:05:22.088 line:95%,end
You have to be big, and strong,
and tough, and nasty.

00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:24.624 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Nia finally gets a special part,

00:05:24.691 --> 00:05:27.126 line:95%,end
she gets a featured role,
and I'm happy for her.

00:05:27.193 --> 00:05:28.928 line:95%,end
Finally she gets a chance.

00:05:28.995 --> 00:05:33.099 line:95%,end
But I'm not happy with Nia
being selected to portray a bully.

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:36.202 line:95%,end
That leaves me
with one more bit of news.

00:05:36.269 --> 00:05:38.104 line:95%,end
<i>I know that they're all assuming</i>
<i>that that's Brooke</i>

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:41.174 line:5%,start
<i>underneath that piece of paper,</i>
<i>but it's not.</i>

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.042 line:95%,end
I always have a trick up my sleeve.

00:05:44.444 --> 00:05:46.379 line:95%,end
(dramatic music playing)

00:05:46.446 --> 00:05:48.081 line:95%,end
I'm bringing in another member,

a strong dancer,

00:05:50.416 --> 00:05:51.617 line:95%,end
that can go up against our bully.

00:05:51.684 --> 00:05:54.153 line:95%,end
We were looking for one person.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.389 line:95%,end
Find her a spot--solo, duet, anything.

00:05:56.456 --> 00:05:57.290 line:95%,end
Give her something.

00:05:57.357 --> 00:05:59.726 line:95%,end
Please welcome Peyton.

Okay, girls. Enough, come on, come on.

She's going to come in

right out from under Kendall.

00:06:31.457 --> 00:06:33.326 line:95%,end
I hate this whole idea.

ABBY: Peyton,
you finally have a place.

But you need to prove yourself.

You are on probation.

00:06:40.533 --> 00:06:42.168 line:95%,end
You are the new kid on the block.

It's a whole new ball game.

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.473 line:95%,end
Without Brooke
there is only one spot open

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.208 line:95%,end
on this competition team.

00:06:49.275 --> 00:06:52.111 line:95%,end
Kendall and Peyton
both want that spot.

00:06:52.178 --> 00:06:53.846 line:95%,end
Let's get ready to rehearse.

00:06:53.913 --> 00:06:55.982 line:95%,end
Moms, you're dismissed.

00:06:56.048 --> 00:06:57.683 line:5%,start
(upbeat music playing)


00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.453 line:5%,start
ABBY: Soutenu, outside
compass, chaines,

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.688 line:95%,end
up, up, chaines, down, down.

00:07:02.755 --> 00:07:06.392 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Chloe, Maddie, and Paige have had
a trio since they were four years old.

00:07:06.459 --> 00:07:07.860 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Undefeated, I have you.

00:07:07.927 --> 00:07:09.629 line:95%,end
-KELLY: Yes, we have never lost.
-Never.

00:07:09.695 --> 00:07:11.864 line:95%,end
And I just think that
that's really rotten

00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:13.466 line:95%,end
that Paige was pulled from that trio.

00:07:13.533 --> 00:07:15.601 line:95%,end
-I don't think she's replacing Paige.
-KELLY: Well, she did.

00:07:15.668 --> 00:07:16.669 line:95%,end
I honestly--

00:07:16.736 --> 00:07:17.937 line:95%,end
She just did.

00:07:18.004 --> 00:07:19.772 line:95%,end
CHRISTI:
<i>Jill's a little Pollyanna right now.</i>

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:21.441 line:5%,start
She's like, oh, this is all so great.

00:07:21.507 --> 00:07:23.309 line:5%,start
Everybody gets a turn.
Well, you know what?

00:07:23.376 --> 00:07:24.377 line:95%,end
Not with the trio.

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:25.845 line:95%,end
The trio is sort of something
that's untouchable,

00:07:25.912 --> 00:07:27.413 line:95%,end
you leave it alone.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.681 line:95%,end
Shove her forward.

00:07:28.748 --> 00:07:29.882 line:95%,end
Go.

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:31.417 line:95%,end
(dramatic music playing)

00:07:31.484 --> 00:07:32.418 line:95%,end
Do you see what Nia's doing?

00:07:32.485 --> 00:07:33.786 line:95%,end
ABBY: Bigger, harder, let's go.

00:07:33.853 --> 00:07:35.721 line:95%,end
Push her.

00:07:35.788 --> 00:07:37.690 line:95%,end
<i>Every single night on the news,</i>

00:07:37.757 --> 00:07:40.393 line:95%,end
you hear something about bullying

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.895 line:95%,end
and problems in our schools today.

00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:46.666 line:95%,end
And I think it's important
for the children as artists

00:07:46.732 --> 00:07:49.135 line:95%,end
<i>to convey that message to their audience.</i>

00:07:49.202 --> 00:07:50.303 line:95%,end
Push her.

00:07:50.369 --> 00:07:51.971 line:95%,end
MELISSA: And then she's probably
going to have to kick somebody.

00:07:52.038 --> 00:07:52.872 line:95%,end
(woman gasping)

00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:53.773 line:95%,end
Stick it in their face.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:54.941 line:95%,end
And then pull Kendall's ponytails.

00:07:55.007 --> 00:07:56.476 line:95%,end
ABBY: Keep working on it.

00:07:56.542 --> 00:07:58.311 line:95%,end
Oh, this is ridiculous.

00:07:58.377 --> 00:08:00.146 line:95%,end
The role of a dance mom is not easy.

00:08:00.213 --> 00:08:02.281 line:95%,end
Sometimes you have to make
really tough decisions,

00:08:02.348 --> 00:08:05.418 line:95%,end
<i>and this is one of those times.</i>

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:07.286 line:95%,end
Nia was not going to portray the bully.

00:08:07.353 --> 00:08:09.388 line:95%,end
<i>There was no need for her</i>
<i>to have that role.</i>

00:08:09.455 --> 00:08:12.525 line:95%,end
<i>She can play lots of characters,</i>
<i>but she's not playing a bully.</i>

00:08:14.694 --> 00:08:16.562 line:95%,end
-What?
-I have a huge problem

00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:17.864 line:95%,end
with Nia portraying the bully.

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:22.902 line:95%,end
I know you're going to say,
she's playing a character.

00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:24.504 line:95%,end
I finally give you a part, kid.

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:25.872 line:95%,end
HOLLY: I know.
I want her to be a featured part.

00:08:25.938 --> 00:08:28.040 line:95%,end
I just want her to be a part--
I want her to be part of the dance.

00:08:28.107 --> 00:08:31.143 line:95%,end
At my school
there is a zero tolerance policy

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:32.478 line:95%,end
regarding bullying.

00:08:32.545 --> 00:08:34.213 line:95%,end
I wish there was
a zero tolerance policy also

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.848 line:95%,end
at the dance studio too.

00:08:35.915 --> 00:08:37.617 line:95%,end
Peyton, you're the bully.

00:08:37.683 --> 00:08:38.784 line:95%,end
Nia, you're not the bully.

00:08:38.851 --> 00:08:42.188 line:95%,end
NIA: <i>My mom didn't like the part</i>
<i>that I was doing in the dance,</i>

00:08:42.255 --> 00:08:45.157 line:95%,end
because it's a bully,
and I'm not a bully.

00:08:45.224 --> 00:08:46.759 line:95%,end
ABBY: You got a featured part
in a number,

00:08:46.826 --> 00:08:48.060 line:95%,end
and your mom took it away from you.

00:08:48.127 --> 00:08:49.629 line:95%,end
Not me.

00:08:49.695 --> 00:08:52.832 line:95%,end
She took a part away from her child.

00:08:52.899 --> 00:08:53.933 line:95%,end
I didn't.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.768 line:95%,end
HOLLY: <i>I want Nia to have a feature part.</i>

00:08:55.835 --> 00:08:57.303 line:95%,end
<i>I wanted her to be part of the dance.</i>

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.839 line:95%,end
But I don't want her to have
that featured part.

00:08:59.906 --> 00:09:01.674 line:95%,end
Chloe, you're going to enter first.

00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:03.242 line:95%,end
Right there.

00:09:03.309 --> 00:09:05.711 line:95%,end
You're on the top of the pyramid,
don't push it.

00:09:05.778 --> 00:09:07.446 line:95%,end
I don't know why your mother doesn't
say you have confidence.

00:09:07.513 --> 00:09:09.348 line:95%,end
You are the cockiest kid
I've ever worked with.

00:09:09.415 --> 00:09:12.018 line:95%,end
CHRISTI:
Isn't it ironic that Abby's tactics

00:09:12.084 --> 00:09:15.721 line:95%,end
are very equivalent to bullying
in a dance about bullying.

00:09:15.788 --> 00:09:18.391 line:95%,end
I'm giving you both legs straight,
and you're doing one bent.

00:09:18.457 --> 00:09:19.825 line:95%,end
Do you understand?

00:09:19.892 --> 00:09:21.961 line:95%,end
She just doesn't have a brain
in her head, move in.

00:09:22.028 --> 00:09:24.630 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>I have to be very careful</i>
<i>of the battles I pick with Abby,</i>

00:09:24.697 --> 00:09:26.699 line:95%,end
<i>because Abby doesn't like me.</i>

00:09:26.766 --> 00:09:29.135 line:95%,end
<i>She's made that perfectly clear.</i>

00:09:29.201 --> 00:09:30.703 line:95%,end
But when I see Chloe starting to cry,

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:34.473 line:95%,end
and I see the tears actually on her shirt
of her dance wear,

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:36.609 line:95%,end
I'm thinking, oh God,
what is going on in there?

00:09:36.676 --> 00:09:38.377 line:95%,end
She's an evil bitch.

00:09:39.512 --> 00:09:41.347 line:95%,end
Chloe's crying.

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:43.482 line:95%,end
ABBY: I expect more from you.

00:09:43.549 --> 00:09:45.284 line:95%,end
You should know
what's straight legs are.

00:09:45.351 --> 00:09:47.286 line:95%,end
And you ignore me,
and you just keep going.

00:09:47.353 --> 00:09:50.056 line:95%,end
CHLOE: <i>I'm a little upset,</i>
<i>because I didn't understand</i>

00:09:50.122 --> 00:09:52.191 line:5%,start
what Miss Abby was saying
to me for choreography.

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:55.328 line:95%,end
ABBY: You're not a choreographer,
don't start being one.

00:09:55.394 --> 00:09:56.796 line:95%,end
CHLOE: And she yelled at me,

00:09:56.862 --> 00:09:59.332 line:95%,end
<i>because I was doing another thing.</i>

00:09:59.398 --> 00:10:01.334 line:95%,end
<i>She was like, you're choreographing,</i>

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.469 line:95%,end
<i>and I really wasn't trying to choreograph.</i>

00:10:03.536 --> 00:10:05.771 line:95%,end
I just didn't know what she meant.

00:10:05.838 --> 00:10:06.839 line:95%,end
She'll come out.

00:10:06.906 --> 00:10:08.307 line:95%,end
KELLY: She isn't going to come out.

00:10:08.374 --> 00:10:09.742 line:95%,end
Do you want to go down and see?

00:10:09.809 --> 00:10:11.978 line:95%,end
-KELLY: Abby will kill her.
-I can't walk in that room.

00:10:12.044 --> 00:10:13.980 line:95%,end
Well, Chloe isn't
going to walk out.

00:10:14.046 --> 00:10:15.314 line:95%,end
-HOLLY: Go get her.
-KELLY: Then she'll yelled at more.

00:10:15.381 --> 00:10:16.682 line:95%,end
ABBY: You're on the top of the pyramid.

00:10:16.749 --> 00:10:17.783 line:95%,end
Suck it up.

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.353 line:95%,end
The next kid's on speed dial
to come to the studio.


00:10:23.122 --> 00:10:25.091 line:5%,start
(dramatic music playing)

00:10:25.157 --> 00:10:27.693 line:5%,start
-(doorbell)

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.929 line:5%,start
KELLY: <i>Brooke made</i>
<i>the cheerleading team,</i>

00:10:29.996 --> 00:10:32.965 line:5%,start
and I thought it was a good idea
to have all the girls

00:10:33.032 --> 00:10:36.002 line:95%,end
<i>come to my house and have a party</i>
<i>to congratulate Brooke.</i>

00:10:36.068 --> 00:10:37.269 line:95%,end
Oh, I love you.

00:10:37.336 --> 00:10:38.170 line:95%,end
MACKENZIE: <i>I miss Brooke.</i>

00:10:38.237 --> 00:10:40.906 line:5%,start
I miss having her here
on the dance team.

00:10:40.973 --> 00:10:43.643 line:95%,end
Is cheerleading different than dance?

00:10:44.276 --> 00:10:47.046 line:95%,end
Is the teacher nicer than Miss Abby?

00:10:47.113 --> 00:10:49.715 line:95%,end
PAIGE: Brooke, show us something
that you learned from cheer.

00:10:49.782 --> 00:10:51.651 line:95%,end
Ready? Okay.

00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:53.519 line:95%,end
(girls giggling)

00:10:53.586 --> 00:10:56.088 line:95%,end
PAIGE: Two, four, six, eight,
who do we appreciate?

00:10:56.155 --> 00:10:57.289 line:95%,end
Nia! Nia!

00:10:57.356 --> 00:10:58.357 line:95%,end
-Go Nia!
-(giggling)

00:10:58.424 --> 00:10:59.425 line:95%,end
I miss you, Brooke.

00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:00.893 line:95%,end
You're like--you're, like,
the best friend ever.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.495 line:95%,end
GIRL: You're my sister.

00:11:03.896 --> 00:11:05.531 line:95%,end
BROOKE: <i>I really miss the girls.</i>

00:11:05.598 --> 00:11:07.767 line:5%,start
They're pretty much a part of my family,

00:11:07.833 --> 00:11:09.902 line:95%,end
and I feel like I haven't seen them
in years.

00:11:09.969 --> 00:11:11.637 line:95%,end
Do you wish you were coming
with us this week?

00:11:11.704 --> 00:11:14.340 line:95%,end
No, because I'm going to a football game.

00:11:14.407 --> 00:11:16.342 line:95%,end
Do you want to come back to dance?

00:11:16.409 --> 00:11:17.309 line:95%,end
I don't know.

00:11:19.545 --> 00:11:20.880 line:5%,start
ABBY: Tuck, ball change.

00:11:20.946 --> 00:11:22.415 line:5%,start
Plie and push.

00:11:22.481 --> 00:11:23.816 line:5%,start
MADDIE: I really want to dance around

00:11:23.883 --> 00:11:26.118 line:5%,start
and beat Chloe and get back
to the top of the pyramid.

00:11:26.185 --> 00:11:30.423 line:5%,start
ABBY: Five and six, seven and eight.

00:11:30.489 --> 00:11:32.458 line:5%,start
I think Maddie's ready
for the challenge

00:11:32.525 --> 00:11:35.194 line:95%,end
<i>of going up against me,</i>
<i>because she's a very strong dancer.</i>

00:11:35.261 --> 00:11:37.396 line:95%,end
So I hope I do great at my solo.

00:11:40.633 --> 00:11:43.302 line:5%,start
(tense music playing)

00:11:45.304 --> 00:11:46.472 line:5%,start
Peyton's things working out fine.

00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:48.808 line:95%,end
<i>She, again, is a natural-born leader,</i>

00:11:48.874 --> 00:11:51.110 line:95%,end
<i>so she's taking the place</i>
<i>of Brooke rather well.</i>

00:11:51.177 --> 00:11:53.212 line:95%,end
She counts the music, she gets it.

00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:55.147 line:95%,end
Her and Maddie
have worked together before,

00:11:55.214 --> 00:11:57.016 line:95%,end
<i>so they're doing some partner work.</i>

00:11:57.817 --> 00:11:59.985 line:95%,end
JILL: That is amazing,
because they're all different ages,

00:12:00.052 --> 00:12:01.921 line:95%,end
but they're all the same height.

00:12:01.987 --> 00:12:03.222 line:95%,end
And then we got big Peyton.

00:12:03.289 --> 00:12:06.659 line:5%,start
My name is Leslie,
and I've been in Abby's for four years.

00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:10.096 line:95%,end
JILL: I just really hope that Peyton
doesn't look too big.

00:12:10.162 --> 00:12:12.798 line:5%,start
I don't understand
why Peyton is back in the picture.

00:12:12.865 --> 00:12:16.202 line:95%,end
Peyton's too big, she's going
to stand out like a sore thumb.

00:12:16.268 --> 00:12:18.838 line:95%,end
<i>Now, Kendall fits right into this group.</i>

00:12:18.904 --> 00:12:20.639 line:95%,end
LESLIE: <i>Call bias, I'm her mother.</i>

00:12:20.706 --> 00:12:22.742 line:95%,end
I think she's the better dancer.

00:12:22.808 --> 00:12:25.111 line:95%,end
I'm going to say she's a better dancer
than Kendall in this style.

00:12:25.177 --> 00:12:28.114 line:95%,end
I do understand that Jill
would be uncomfortable.

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:30.282 line:95%,end
<i>I'm going to let her know</i>
<i>that I think Peyton</i>

00:12:30.349 --> 00:12:31.717 line:95%,end
should be on this team
and not her daughter.

00:12:31.784 --> 00:12:33.686 line:95%,end
I've put more time in than she has.

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:36.388 line:95%,end
I think Peyton being picked
to be showcased

00:12:36.455 --> 00:12:37.790 line:95%,end
as the bully in the lead--

00:12:37.857 --> 00:12:39.291 line:95%,end
But she got that by default.

00:12:39.358 --> 00:12:41.827 line:95%,end
Well, Jill, they could have given it
to Kendall,

00:12:41.894 --> 00:12:43.028 line:95%,end
but no, they gave it to Peyton,

00:12:43.095 --> 00:12:44.497 line:95%,end
and I think Abby made the right choice.

00:12:45.397 --> 00:12:48.234 line:95%,end
ABBY: I don't know Jill well enough
to guesstimate

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:50.035 line:95%,end
how she's going to handle Leslie,

00:12:50.102 --> 00:12:51.604 line:95%,end
but I do know Leslie.

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:53.506 line:95%,end
And I'll tell you what,

00:12:53.572 --> 00:12:55.641 line:95%,end
Jill better get a own baseball bat out.

00:12:55.708 --> 00:12:58.010 line:95%,end
She originally picked Kendall
over Peyton

00:12:58.077 --> 00:12:59.378 line:95%,end
to dance with this group,

00:12:59.445 --> 00:13:04.016 line:95%,end
and my fear is now that we need an extra,
she's putting Peyton in.

00:13:04.083 --> 00:13:06.085 line:95%,end
<i>Originally, she didn't want Peyton.</i>

00:13:06.152 --> 00:13:08.854 line:95%,end
There had to have been
a reason behind it,

00:13:08.921 --> 00:13:11.690 line:95%,end
and I hope that doesn't hurt the group
in the long run.

00:13:11.757 --> 00:13:13.926 line:95%,end
That's all. I know she's a good dancer.

00:13:13.993 --> 00:13:15.594 line:95%,end
Then why do you think they put in it

00:13:15.661 --> 00:13:17.062 line:95%,end
when they could have picked somebody else?

00:13:17.129 --> 00:13:19.598 line:95%,end
Because you reamed her out, and said,
you better find a spot for her.

00:13:19.665 --> 00:13:20.533 line:95%,end
LESLIE: And who am?

00:13:20.599 --> 00:13:21.667 line:95%,end
Who am I?

00:13:21.734 --> 00:13:23.502 line:95%,end
Why does my--why is my word gold?

00:13:23.569 --> 00:13:25.037 line:95%,end
You said before you had Abby's ear,

00:13:25.104 --> 00:13:27.039 line:95%,end
-and I actually I do commend you on that.
-I do have Abby's ear.

00:13:27.106 --> 00:13:28.274 line:95%,end
That's exactly why.

00:13:29.508 --> 00:13:30.543 line:95%,end
We'll see.

00:13:30.609 --> 00:13:32.978 line:95%,end
I'm a little concerned right now
about Leslie,

00:13:33.045 --> 00:13:35.014 line:95%,end
because I know
at the open audition,

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.582 line:95%,end
<i>she had a blowout with Abby.</i>

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:41.053 line:95%,end
And I know that she asked Abby
to do whatever she had to do

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:44.056 line:95%,end
<i>to get Peyton on with this dance team.</i>

00:13:44.123 --> 00:13:45.524 line:95%,end
Put that big bully in there.

00:13:45.591 --> 00:13:47.293 line:95%,end
(laughter)

00:13:47.359 --> 00:13:48.828 line:95%,end
-JILL: (indistinct)
-Like mother, like daughter.

00:13:50.496 --> 00:13:53.265 line:95%,end
She's a big bully, not just a bully.

00:13:53.332 --> 00:13:54.733 line:95%,end
More person to watch.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.937 line:5%,start
(upbeat music playing)

00:13:58.003 --> 00:14:00.072 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>A trio is one</i>
<i>of the most difficult numbers to do</i>

00:14:00.139 --> 00:14:01.574 line:95%,end
<i>because of spacing.</i>

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.275 line:95%,end
You rehearse those groups
over and over

00:14:03.342 --> 00:14:05.711 line:95%,end
so you have spatial awareness
of where everybody is.

00:14:05.778 --> 00:14:07.079 line:95%,end
Paige, are you running the music?

00:14:07.813 --> 00:14:10.950 line:95%,end
<i>I think that Kendall is doing a great job.</i>

00:14:11.016 --> 00:14:14.687 line:95%,end
<i>I don't know if Paige would</i>
<i>have been a better choice or not</i>

00:14:14.753 --> 00:14:18.224 line:95%,end
given the fact that
it's a very difficult choreography


00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:19.291 line:95%,end
count wise.

00:14:19.358 --> 00:14:22.127 line:95%,end
Six, seven, and eight.

00:14:22.194 --> 00:14:25.331 line:95%,end
Whoa, whoa, whoa, eight.

00:14:27.099 --> 00:14:28.167 line:95%,end
That feels awkward.

00:14:28.234 --> 00:14:31.237 line:95%,end
<i>I think Paige would have been Darling</i>
<i>as an actress,</i>

00:14:31.303 --> 00:14:34.006 line:95%,end
but her ability to comprehend
quickly and remember

00:14:34.073 --> 00:14:35.808 line:95%,end
<i>is not to where Kendall's is.</i>

00:14:36.709 --> 00:14:38.043 line:95%,end
JILL: <i>Poor Paige? Where's Paige at?</i>

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:39.979 line:95%,end
Uh-oh, I think
she's running the music, Kelly.

00:14:41.213 --> 00:14:43.215 line:95%,end
That is like, such (bleep).

00:14:43.282 --> 00:14:45.084 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>So Abby's running</i>
<i>practice for the trio,</i>

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:47.453 line:95%,end
<i>she has Paige running the music.</i>

00:14:47.519 --> 00:14:49.521 line:95%,end
First of all,
you replaced her with Kendall.

00:14:49.588 --> 00:14:51.557 line:95%,end
<i>And now you have her sitting in there</i>

00:14:51.624 --> 00:14:53.792 line:95%,end
<i>watching her learn the choreography</i>

00:14:53.859 --> 00:14:56.462 line:95%,end
<i>and having her playing the music</i>
<i>while they're learning it.</i>

00:14:56.528 --> 00:14:58.964 line:95%,end
Like, why would you do that
to a 10-year-old kid?

00:14:59.031 --> 00:15:00.132 line:95%,end
It's just wrong.

00:15:00.199 --> 00:15:02.902 line:95%,end
There's no reason my daughter
should be sitting in that room

00:15:02.968 --> 00:15:04.403 line:95%,end
<i>playing music.</i>

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:07.006 line:95%,end
She's just doing it to hurt her.

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.776 line:95%,end
LESLIE: I love when Abby dances
with the group. Look at that.

00:15:10.843 --> 00:15:12.311 line:95%,end
I know, it cracks me up.
Okay, I'm going to look--

00:15:12.378 --> 00:15:13.846 line:95%,end
I would love to see her do
one turn though.

00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:14.747 line:95%,end
-(indistinct)
-Ha!

00:15:14.813 --> 00:15:16.015 line:95%,end
On a pigeon toe.

00:15:16.081 --> 00:15:18.484 line:95%,end
KELLY: (yells) I don't think
she could do something on one foot.

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:20.019 line:95%,end
Her leg can't hold up her body.

00:15:20.085 --> 00:15:22.354 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Can you imagine that ankle?
It would be screaming stop!

00:15:22.421 --> 00:15:23.722 line:95%,end
(laughter)

00:15:23.789 --> 00:15:25.090 line:95%,end
I don't think that would work.

00:15:27.159 --> 00:15:29.662 line:95%,end
(soft music playing)

00:15:30.362 --> 00:15:32.564 line:95%,end
LESLIE: <i>I was very surprised</i>
<i>that Abby called me</i>

00:15:32.631 --> 00:15:34.700 line:95%,end
and asked Peyton to fill in for Brooke.

00:15:34.767 --> 00:15:38.070 line:95%,end
<i>And I knew when I got back that I really</i>
<i>should get together with the moms.</i>

00:15:38.137 --> 00:15:40.773 line:95%,end
<i>And I just wanted to talk with them</i>
<i>and have coffee and lunch</i>

00:15:40.839 --> 00:15:43.108 line:95%,end
<i>and just see how they felt</i>
<i>about Peyton joining their team.</i>

00:15:43.175 --> 00:15:46.679 line:95%,end
I am so excited, and I wanted
to let you know how excited I am

00:15:46.745 --> 00:15:50.516 line:95%,end
that Peyton is actually competing
with this dance team now.

00:15:50.582 --> 00:15:53.485 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: I'm a little skeptical why Leslie
wants to invite us out for coffee.

00:15:53.552 --> 00:15:55.521 line:5%,start
I've known Leslie for a long time,

00:15:56.422 --> 00:15:59.658 line:95%,end
and there's usually
an underhanded motive behind Leslie.

00:15:59.725 --> 00:16:01.327 line:95%,end
And Brooke wants to cheerlead.

00:16:01.393 --> 00:16:03.595 line:95%,end
Why do you get up every single day

00:16:03.662 --> 00:16:06.632 line:95%,end
and drive to that studio
if this lady tortures you?

00:16:06.699 --> 00:16:08.334 line:95%,end
I just need that answer.

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.736 line:95%,end
My daughter, Paige,
wants to be there with her friends.

00:16:10.803 --> 00:16:12.304 line:95%,end
Okay, Christi, let's go to you.

00:16:12.371 --> 00:16:13.372 line:95%,end
Why are you there then?

00:16:13.439 --> 00:16:14.974 line:95%,end
-If she had been--
-You know what, Leslie?

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.408 line:95%,end
That's between me and my daughter.

00:16:16.475 --> 00:16:18.610 line:95%,end
I don't feel like I have to sit here
and answer to people why.

00:16:18.677 --> 00:16:21.347 line:95%,end
You don't have to answer,
but you do complain about it a lot.

00:16:21.413 --> 00:16:22.314 line:95%,end
Yes.

00:16:22.381 --> 00:16:25.551 line:5%,start
MELISSA: Leslie kind of likes
to take charge of every situation.

00:16:25.617 --> 00:16:27.853 line:5%,start
It's just her--it's just her way.

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.888 line:95%,end
If it comes down to it
and Brooke does come back,

00:16:29.955 --> 00:16:32.524 line:95%,end
I think Brooke and Peyton
should be able to say before Kendall.

00:16:32.591 --> 00:16:33.892 line:95%,end
You are new.

00:16:33.959 --> 00:16:36.128 line:95%,end
You're on probation.
Peyton should not be on probation.

00:16:38.097 --> 00:16:39.465 line:95%,end
Hi.

00:16:39.531 --> 00:16:41.266 line:95%,end
(interposing voices)

00:16:42.701 --> 00:16:43.936 line:95%,end
Thanks for coming.

00:16:44.703 --> 00:16:47.039 line:95%,end
What did Nia have to say
last night about it?

00:16:47.106 --> 00:16:48.107 line:95%,end
She was upset.

00:16:48.173 --> 00:16:50.042 line:95%,end
I understand why I shouldn't be the bully,

00:16:50.109 --> 00:16:52.077 line:95%,end
because people would think
I was a bad person.

00:16:52.144 --> 00:16:55.247 line:95%,end
I mean, we've had many issues
and conversations

00:16:55.314 --> 00:16:59.184 line:95%,end
over the years of Abby
about certain stereotypes.

00:16:59.251 --> 00:17:01.587 line:95%,end
And at a certain point,
we have to draw the line.

00:17:01.653 --> 00:17:05.891 line:95%,end
And having been portrayed
as an aggressive person,

00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:07.393 line:95%,end
it's just--that was--it was too much.

00:17:07.459 --> 00:17:09.094 line:95%,end
LESLIE: Again, though, it's just a dance.

00:17:09.161 --> 00:17:11.296 line:95%,end
It's just a dance for you,
but it's part of my identity.

00:17:11.363 --> 00:17:12.664 line:95%,end
-So it goes beyond the dance.
-Right.

00:17:12.731 --> 00:17:14.733 line:95%,end
<i>Leslie is a very strong personality.</i>

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:18.170 line:5%,start
She's not so open to hearing
other people's ideas.

00:17:18.237 --> 00:17:19.705 line:95%,end
I'm just saying my opinion--

00:17:19.772 --> 00:17:22.341 line:95%,end
I still stand by my decision
that my daughter dances

00:17:22.408 --> 00:17:24.376 line:95%,end
in whatever number is put there.

00:17:24.443 --> 00:17:26.545 line:95%,end
She's going to do,
and she's going to act out that part.

00:17:26.612 --> 00:17:28.647 line:95%,end
That's what my kids are going to do.

00:17:28.714 --> 00:17:30.582 line:95%,end
She told Chloe last night
that she has got somebody

00:17:30.649 --> 00:17:31.784 line:95%,end
on speed dial to replace her.

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:32.951 line:95%,end
You know she just says that.

00:17:33.018 --> 00:17:33.886 line:95%,end
I know, but it makes me--

00:17:33.952 --> 00:17:35.487 line:95%,end
(interposing voices)

00:17:35.554 --> 00:17:37.723 line:95%,end
But you still bring your daughter back
to cry the next day.

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:38.857 line:95%,end
I don't get it.

00:17:38.924 --> 00:17:40.025 line:95%,end
Well, you don't have to get it, Leslie.

00:17:40.092 --> 00:17:42.027 line:95%,end
You know what I say to Peyton
when Abby says something to her?

00:17:42.094 --> 00:17:44.730 line:95%,end
Shut up and take it,
or find a new studio painting

00:17:44.797 --> 00:17:47.366 line:95%,end
that you don't feel this way
when you leave here.

00:17:47.433 --> 00:17:49.701 line:95%,end
That's your opinion about the situation,
mine is different.

00:17:49.768 --> 00:17:51.270 line:95%,end
Well, if you feel that bad
that your daughter is crying

00:17:51.336 --> 00:17:53.338 line:95%,end
and you don't take her
somewhere else, Christi,

00:17:53.405 --> 00:17:55.541 line:95%,end
then what kind of parenting is that?

00:17:55.607 --> 00:17:57.543 line:95%,end
Because it doesn't bother me
that Peyton cries.

00:17:57.609 --> 00:17:58.610 line:95%,end
Ugh!

00:17:58.677 --> 00:18:00.245 line:95%,end
But it still doesn't make it any easier

00:18:00.312 --> 00:18:01.780 line:95%,end
when I'm watching my daughter cry.

00:18:01.847 --> 00:18:02.681 line:95%,end
Then shut up.

00:18:02.748 --> 00:18:05.017 line:95%,end
No one's holding a gun to your head
and driving you here.

00:18:05.084 --> 00:18:06.251 line:95%,end
Go somewhere else.

00:18:06.318 --> 00:18:07.619 line:95%,end
-Like where--
-Leslie--

00:18:07.686 --> 00:18:09.621 line:95%,end
Go somewhere else.


00:18:11.356 --> 00:18:13.759 line:5%,start
(dramatic music playing)

00:18:15.127 --> 00:18:17.096 line:5%,start
ABBY: Everybody
up on the runway, go.

00:18:21.266 --> 00:18:23.936 line:95%,end
When Abby walks in with those
costumes, all I'm thinking is,

00:18:24.002 --> 00:18:26.605 line:5%,start
this is like, prostitots the sequel.

00:18:26.672 --> 00:18:30.109 line:95%,end
As a mom, I'm saying, like,
bare midriffs and fishnets--

00:18:30.175 --> 00:18:31.076 line:95%,end
WOMAN: In school girls.

00:18:31.143 --> 00:18:33.712 line:95%,end
HOLLY: It's not right, it's over the top.

00:18:33.779 --> 00:18:34.780 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Well, I like fishnets.

00:18:34.847 --> 00:18:36.615 line:95%,end
I think they're cute, but not with this.

00:18:36.682 --> 00:18:37.916 line:95%,end
I don't get the holes in the tights.

00:18:37.983 --> 00:18:40.119 line:95%,end
ABBY: You don't need to get it,
you're not judging.

00:18:40.185 --> 00:18:41.453 line:95%,end
-LESLIE: Okay.
-ABBY: Don't worry about it.

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:42.888 line:95%,end
You have to understand, Leslie,

00:18:42.955 --> 00:18:44.423 line:95%,end
I'm going with Peyton as the bully.

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:50.229 line:95%,end
She's older, she would be like
the trashy, mean bad girl

00:18:50.295 --> 00:18:52.131 line:95%,end
that's up to no good Catholic school.

00:18:52.197 --> 00:18:53.298 line:95%,end
That's what I'm going for.

00:18:53.365 --> 00:18:56.201 line:95%,end
Bully and bad girl
is different from trashy, Abby.

00:18:56.268 --> 00:18:58.470 line:95%,end
-Trashy means sleazy, slutty--
-ABBY: No, I--

00:18:58.537 --> 00:18:59.571 line:95%,end
LESLIE: She's 14.

00:18:59.638 --> 00:19:02.474 line:95%,end
She's not--that's not
what she's portraying a bully,

00:19:02.541 --> 00:19:04.877 line:95%,end
not some sleaze in some strip joint.

00:19:04.943 --> 00:19:06.945 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>I don't care</i>
<i>what any of those moms say.</i>

00:19:07.012 --> 00:19:09.281 line:95%,end
<i>It's my studio, it's my company,</i>

00:19:09.348 --> 00:19:12.618 line:95%,end
<i>and they needed something</i>
<i>cutting edge for this routine.</i>

00:19:12.684 --> 00:19:15.487 line:95%,end
I want the number to be good,
because I've got a lot at stake here.

00:19:15.554 --> 00:19:18.290 line:95%,end
So Abby, whatever you think
is going to make the number--

00:19:18.357 --> 00:19:19.858 line:95%,end
Okay, decision made.

00:19:19.925 --> 00:19:21.393 line:95%,end
I am telling you girls this,

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:23.262 line:95%,end
I'm sick and tired
of talking to your mothers.

00:19:23.328 --> 00:19:26.532 line:95%,end
Knee socks, no fishnets.

00:19:26.598 --> 00:19:29.768 line:95%,end
Red trunks, bare midriffs.

00:19:29.835 --> 00:19:31.136 line:95%,end
Everybody understand?

00:19:31.203 --> 00:19:35.040 line:95%,end
Okay, Melissa, Maddie is going to wear
her hair in two ponytails.

00:19:35.107 --> 00:19:37.009 line:95%,end
So the kick me sign goes in the middle.

00:19:37.075 --> 00:19:40.045 line:95%,end
When you do those ponytails,
I want them way up here.

00:19:40.112 --> 00:19:42.080 line:95%,end
I don't want her hair
getting on to the side.

00:19:42.147 --> 00:19:43.649 line:95%,end
<i>Okay, thank you.</i>

00:19:45.617 --> 00:19:48.854 line:5%,start
<i>This weekend the Abby Lee Dance Company</i>

00:19:48.921 --> 00:19:51.290 line:5%,start
and we're going to attend
Hollywood Vibe.

00:19:51.356 --> 00:19:54.993 line:95%,end
<i>The word is out--they know</i>
<i>the Abby Lee Dance Company is coming.</i>

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:56.929 line:95%,end
<i>And lots of people are ready</i>
<i>to kick our butts.</i>

00:19:57.996 --> 00:19:59.398 line:95%,end
Here we are.

00:20:01.066 --> 00:20:03.135 line:95%,end
Girls, I need everyone's attention.

00:20:03.202 --> 00:20:04.570 line:95%,end
This is Hollywood Vibe.

00:20:04.636 --> 00:20:06.572 line:95%,end
These people are working professionals.

00:20:06.638 --> 00:20:08.140 line:95%,end
They're from New York or LA.

00:20:08.207 --> 00:20:10.576 line:95%,end
Even the person that put you on backstage,

00:20:10.642 --> 00:20:12.377 line:95%,end
chances are, come Monday,

00:20:12.444 --> 00:20:14.012 line:95%,end
they are working in some studio,

00:20:14.079 --> 00:20:16.548 line:95%,end
or some talent agency,
or some casting agency.

00:20:16.615 --> 00:20:17.649 line:95%,end
This is important.

00:20:17.716 --> 00:20:20.085 line:95%,end
It could be important to you
for the rest of your life,

00:20:20.152 --> 00:20:21.153 line:95%,end
let alone me.

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:24.690 line:95%,end
<i>I have two moms on probation</i>
<i>and two children on probation.</i>

00:20:24.756 --> 00:20:27.326 line:95%,end
But I don't think they're really equal.

00:20:27.392 --> 00:20:30.529 line:95%,end
I think Jill feels that since
she's been doing this for three weeks

00:20:30.596 --> 00:20:32.397 line:95%,end
that she's ahead of the game

00:20:32.464 --> 00:20:34.533 line:95%,end
<i>and that Peyton is just coming in.</i>

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:37.069 line:95%,end
<i>But I don't think Leslie</i>
<i>realizes that at all.</i>

00:20:37.135 --> 00:20:40.305 line:95%,end
Peyton, I really want you to work,
get your leaps up there.

00:20:40.372 --> 00:20:41.440 line:95%,end
I'm trying.

00:20:41.506 --> 00:20:43.008 line:95%,end
I know you're trying,
but you have to harder.

00:20:43.075 --> 00:20:45.510 line:95%,end
Listen, this is it, you get one shot.

00:20:45.577 --> 00:20:47.246 line:95%,end
If you don't do good today,

00:20:47.312 --> 00:20:48.880 line:95%,end
you're not going to be on the team.

00:20:48.947 --> 00:20:51.750 line:5%,start
I saw the looks that Jill
was giving Peyton and I

00:20:51.817 --> 00:20:54.720 line:95%,end
<i>being that our dressing table</i>
<i>was right next to Kendall and Jill's.</i>

00:20:54.786 --> 00:20:56.455 line:95%,end
But that's fine, we can take it all in.

00:20:56.521 --> 00:20:58.657 line:95%,end
Hey, it's more competitiveness for us.

00:20:58.724 --> 00:21:01.126 line:95%,end
You've got the performance,
you'll beat anybody in the performance.

00:21:01.193 --> 00:21:02.995 line:95%,end
Jill is the new person on the block,

00:21:03.061 --> 00:21:06.331 line:95%,end
so you know, she's got to be worried,
she should be worried.

00:21:06.398 --> 00:21:09.735 line:95%,end
I want you going over that trio
a bazillion times,

00:21:09.801 --> 00:21:12.571 line:95%,end
because I need to know
that you know it inside and out.

00:21:12.638 --> 00:21:16.975 line:5%,start
I'm a wreck,
because I really want her to give 110%,

00:21:17.042 --> 00:21:20.912 line:95%,end
and I can't stand this idea
of still being put on probation.

00:21:20.979 --> 00:21:25.550 line:95%,end
You do good in that trio,
don't forget, this $20 is yours.

00:21:25.617 --> 00:21:27.352 line:95%,end
Put it right there, you can have it.

00:21:27.419 --> 00:21:30.756 line:95%,end
MADDIE: <i>It was kind of weird</i>
<i>that Jill bribed Kendall with $20,</i>

00:21:30.822 --> 00:21:33.525 line:5%,start
because usually the moms
don't do that here.

00:21:33.592 --> 00:21:36.561 line:95%,end
Or they only do it
with like ice cream or something.

00:21:36.628 --> 00:21:38.463 line:95%,end
Jill, Leslie, don't forget,

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:39.798 line:95%,end
-your girls are still on probation.
-Right.

00:21:39.865 --> 00:21:40.899 line:95%,end
-Yes?
-Yes.


00:21:40.966 --> 00:21:42.434 line:95%,end
So we need to see how this goes.

00:21:42.501 --> 00:21:45.237 line:95%,end
And you two are kind
of on probation too.

00:21:45.304 --> 00:21:47.372 line:95%,end
You go right along with the student.

00:21:47.439 --> 00:21:48.573 line:95%,end
I need you to show Abby...

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:49.875 line:95%,end
(interposing voices)

00:21:49.941 --> 00:21:52.177 line:95%,end
...so she gets off your back
and off my back.

00:21:52.244 --> 00:21:56.048 line:95%,end
All this probation stuff,
I've about had it.

00:21:56.114 --> 00:21:59.051 line:95%,end
You know, we're not going to let
Peyton step in

00:21:59.117 --> 00:22:00.819 line:95%,end
and take this out from under you.

00:22:00.886 --> 00:22:03.221 line:95%,end
So you go out there
and you show her why she picked you

00:22:03.288 --> 00:22:04.890 line:95%,end
and that she made the right decision.

00:22:04.956 --> 00:22:06.425 line:95%,end
-Okay.
-You got it?

00:22:06.491 --> 00:22:07.326 line:95%,end
Yeah.

00:22:07.392 --> 00:22:10.662 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:22:13.065 --> 00:22:14.833 line:95%,end
There's one number, guys.
We're going to go.

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:17.669 line:95%,end
The most important thing you do
is when you get up off the floor,

00:22:17.736 --> 00:22:20.105 line:95%,end
you need to move back
so that you have somewhere to dance.

00:22:20.172 --> 00:22:21.873 line:95%,end
All right, come on, let's go.

00:22:24.309 --> 00:22:27.312 line:95%,end
(cheering and applause)

00:22:30.649 --> 00:22:34.920 line:95%,end
So the trio is announced, and it's obvious
to everyone in the audience

00:22:35.554 --> 00:22:37.255 line:95%,end
that Chloe is a mile away from them.

00:22:37.322 --> 00:22:39.458 line:95%,end
Is Chloe supposed to be over there?

00:22:39.524 --> 00:22:40.359 line:95%,end
I don't know.

00:22:41.259 --> 00:22:43.395 line:5%,start
I don't think they would be
having problems with the trio

00:22:43.462 --> 00:22:44.296 line:5%,start
if Paige was in it.

00:22:44.363 --> 00:22:48.100 line:95%,end
And I think just throwing a new
person in it, it's not working.

00:22:48.166 --> 00:22:51.169 line:95%,end
(tense music playing)

00:22:52.537 --> 00:22:54.673 line:95%,end
WOMAN: <i>I don't know</i>
<i>how I've lasted this long with him.</i>

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:55.974 line:95%,end
<i>Joan, he means well.</i>

00:22:56.041 --> 00:22:58.677 line:95%,end
<i>For all his book smarts,</i>
<i>he has not one ounce of common sense.</i>

00:22:58.744 --> 00:23:00.445 line:95%,end
<i>Well, that's not his fault.</i>

00:23:00.512 --> 00:23:02.314 line:95%,end
<i>How's that? He's a man.</i>

00:23:02.381 --> 00:23:03.582 line:95%,end
<i>That's just the way men are.</i>

00:23:03.648 --> 00:23:05.851 line:95%,end
<i>There's no trust, no faith, no honesty.</i>

00:23:05.917 --> 00:23:07.285 line:95%,end
<i>Men, it's just in their DNA to be--</i>

00:23:07.352 --> 00:23:09.454 line:95%,end
<i>Annoying? Precisely.</i>

00:23:09.521 --> 00:23:11.523 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:16.061 line:95%,end
SINGER: <i>âªI'm so annoyed</i>

Woo, girls.

00:24:10.482 --> 00:24:11.316 line:95%,end
What did you think?

00:24:11.383 --> 00:24:12.317 line:95%,end
It was good.

00:24:12.384 --> 00:24:15.754 line:95%,end
Kendall, right when I thought I was
going to order that sweatsuit for you,

00:24:15.821 --> 00:24:17.823 line:95%,end
I saw that foot up in the air. Yes?

I was going to give you your sweat suit,

but I'm not going to.

00:24:20.892 --> 00:24:22.527 line:95%,end
You're still on probation.

00:24:22.594 --> 00:24:24.563 line:95%,end
I was so angry with her.

00:24:24.629 --> 00:24:26.364 line:95%,end
You have to angle yourself and make sure

00:24:26.431 --> 00:24:28.066 line:95%,end
that people don't see things.

00:24:28.133 --> 00:24:28.967 line:95%,end
Okie-doke?

00:24:29.034 --> 00:24:30.769 line:95%,end
Spacing was a little off
the beginning, Chloe.

00:24:30.836 --> 00:24:33.772 line:95%,end
You're way far stage left. Yes?

00:24:33.839 --> 00:24:35.474 line:95%,end
It's funny. The girl at the
top of the pyramid

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:38.410 line:95%,end
takes the fall for the spacing
being screwed up in the trio.

00:24:38.477 --> 00:24:39.711 line:95%,end
You know, it was all Chloe's fault.

00:24:39.778 --> 00:24:41.480 line:95%,end
But meanwhile, there's a huge microphone

00:24:41.546 --> 00:24:43.081 line:95%,end
where she was supposed
to be sitting on stage.

00:24:43.148 --> 00:24:46.084 line:95%,end
So wisely, she chose not to sit
on the microphone

00:24:46.151 --> 00:24:48.153 line:95%,end
and straddle it but sit next to it.

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:51.389 line:95%,end
That's why, moms, you go into
the audience ahead of time,

00:24:51.456 --> 00:24:54.092 line:95%,end
before the competition starts,
you look at it,

00:24:54.159 --> 00:24:55.861 line:95%,end
you figure out
where you're going to be lined up.

00:24:55.927 --> 00:24:57.195 line:95%,end
You figure that all out.

00:24:57.262 --> 00:24:59.631 line:95%,end
Chloe, the pressure is on. Yes?

00:24:59.698 --> 00:25:01.433 line:95%,end
Abby is the one who
brought Chloe to this place

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:03.502 line:95%,end
that she can't get out of this head space.

00:25:04.703 --> 00:25:08.607 line:95%,end
And she's going to beat herself
in her own mind.

Chloe's getting ready to go on
and perform.

00:26:59.618 --> 00:27:01.386 line:5%,start
She's at the top of the pyramid this week,

00:27:01.453 --> 00:27:04.689 line:95%,end
<i>and you once you're at the top,</i>
<i>the only place to go is down.</i>

00:27:04.756 --> 00:27:06.825 line:95%,end

<i>lot of pressure on her.</i>

00:27:06.891 --> 00:27:09.060 line:95%,end

Now you realize that I am
letting you do this a little

00:27:13.131 --> 00:27:14.299 line:95%,end
because you've earned it.

00:27:14.366 --> 00:27:16.768 line:95%,end
I put you at the top of that pyramid,
and you deserve it.

00:27:16.835 --> 00:27:17.669 line:95%,end
Do you understand?

00:27:17.736 --> 00:27:19.237 line:95%,end
It's one thing getting on top,

00:27:19.304 --> 00:27:21.706 line:95%,end
but it's a whole other thing
staying on top.

00:27:21.773 --> 00:27:24.743 line:5%,start
Miss Abby keep saying,
everyone's replaceable.

00:27:24.809 --> 00:27:25.944 line:95%,end
<i>And I'm a little nervous.</i>

00:27:26.011 --> 00:27:27.445 line:95%,end

that Chloe had in the green room
over her solo,

00:29:01.973 --> 00:29:03.108 line:95%,end
she stepped on stage

00:29:03.174 --> 00:29:06.277 line:95%,end
and she danced it just like
I thought she would do.

00:29:06.344 --> 00:29:08.480 line:95%,end
I just don't know why she
gets in that head space

00:29:08.546 --> 00:29:09.447 line:95%,end
and can't get out of it.

00:29:09.514 --> 00:29:12.650 line:95%,end

WOMAN: Good job!

00:29:15.687 --> 00:29:16.521 line:95%,end
Well done.

00:29:16.588 --> 00:29:17.522 line:95%,end
Good job, Chloe.

00:29:18.356 --> 00:29:20.158 line:95%,end
ABBY: Chloe's solo, I saw a few things

00:29:20.225 --> 00:29:21.226 line:95%,end
that she did wrong.

00:29:21.292 --> 00:29:23.027 line:95%,end
Otherwise, she did a really nice job.

00:29:24.329 --> 00:29:25.463 line:95%,end
Okay, that's over.

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:26.831 line:95%,end
How do you think you did, Chloe?

00:29:26.898 --> 00:29:28.867 line:95%,end
-CHLOE: Good.
-ABBY: Good? All right.

00:29:28.933 --> 00:29:30.902 line:95%,end
Let's get ready for this group number.

00:29:30.969 --> 00:29:32.670 line:95%,end
CHLOE: I thought I did pretty good,

00:29:32.737 --> 00:29:36.474 line:95%,end

would pay attention

00:29:36.541 --> 00:29:40.712 line:95%,end
<i>more to me and my solo as much as she does</i>

00:29:40.779 --> 00:29:42.013 line:95%,end

ABBY: All right, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

00:29:44.082 --> 00:29:45.950 line:95%,end
Does everyone have their socks taped?

00:29:46.684 --> 00:29:48.653 line:95%,end
-Yes?
-KID: Run it with us.

00:29:49.487 --> 00:29:51.689 line:95%,end
What color jazz shoes? Black?

00:29:51.756 --> 00:29:53.558 line:95%,end
ABBY: Did you really ask that, Jill?

00:29:53.625 --> 00:29:54.893 line:95%,end
She has black socks on?

00:29:54.959 --> 00:29:56.060 line:95%,end
What color would you wear?

00:29:57.562 --> 00:29:58.963 line:95%,end
Once again, we're in the green room,

00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:01.900 line:95%,end
and like, nothing's right,
there's no time to rehearse,

00:30:01.966 --> 00:30:05.069 line:95%,end
the girls aren't ready,
Maddie's pigtails are all askew.

00:30:05.136 --> 00:30:06.070 line:95%,end
It's mayhem.

00:30:06.137 --> 00:30:07.472 line:95%,end
LESLIE: Okay.

00:30:07.539 --> 00:30:09.507 line:95%,end
Now marking it, forgot it?

00:30:10.975 --> 00:30:12.844 line:95%,end
You're kidding me.
Thank gosh we're run through it.

00:30:12.911 --> 00:30:14.279 line:95%,end
Come on, Paige.
You want to start it with me?

00:30:14.345 --> 00:30:16.014 line:95%,end
Leslie, were you a dance teacher
in your past life?

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:16.915 line:95%,end
No, why?

00:30:16.981 --> 00:30:18.650 line:95%,end
Because you tell her what to do. She's 14.

00:30:18.716 --> 00:30:20.151 line:95%,end
-I'm allowed to talk to my daughter.
-ABBY: No, I just think

00:30:20.218 --> 00:30:21.152 line:95%,end
that you're treating her like a baby.

00:30:21.219 --> 00:30:22.353 line:95%,end
I'm not treating her like a baby.

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:25.123 line:95%,end
I'm her mother, and she's my daughter,
and she's dancing.

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:27.225 line:95%,end
I'm reiterating
what you tell her all the time.

00:30:27.292 --> 00:30:29.627 line:95%,end
If you don't know it yet,
you're never going to know it.

00:30:29.694 --> 00:30:30.695 line:95%,end
Got it?

00:30:30.762 --> 00:30:33.097 line:95%,end
Not five minutes before you go on.

00:30:33.164 --> 00:30:35.233 line:5%,start
PEYTON: I don't think it's fair that Abby
yells at the parents

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:37.168 line:5%,start
just because the parents know what to do.

00:30:37.235 --> 00:30:39.170 line:95%,end
<i>They're mom's for a reason,</i>
<i>they're helping us.</i>

00:30:39.237 --> 00:30:41.873 line:95%,end
So I don't think that
if she's not in the conversation,

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:43.141 line:95%,end
don't join the conversation.

00:30:43.208 --> 00:30:44.309 line:95%,end
It wasn't meant for you.

00:30:44.843 --> 00:30:46.044 line:95%,end
Let's go.

00:30:46.878 --> 00:30:48.279 line:95%,end
We have to be ready.

00:30:48.346 --> 00:30:49.447 line:95%,end
We're on in one number, let's go.

00:30:49.514 --> 00:30:52.884 line:95%,end
HOLLY: They have to know the number.
Let them finish running it.

00:30:52.951 --> 00:30:53.985 line:95%,end
If it goes on and we miss it,

00:30:54.052 --> 00:30:55.486 line:95%,end
then it doesn't matter
if they know it or not.

00:30:55.553 --> 00:30:56.387 line:95%,end
What's the difference?

00:30:56.454 --> 00:30:57.622 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Doesn't make a difference
if they go on stage

00:30:57.689 --> 00:30:58.957 line:95%,end
-and look like fools?
-LESLIE: It does make a difference.

00:30:59.023 --> 00:30:59.991 line:95%,end
(interposing voices)

00:31:00.058 --> 00:31:01.192 line:95%,end
Let them run the number.

00:31:01.726 --> 00:31:04.629 line:95%,end
-Leslie, it's your first week here.
-It matter if they know it or not.

00:31:04.696 --> 00:31:06.331 line:95%,end
What's the difference? We got to go.

00:31:06.397 --> 00:31:09.667 line:95%,end
ABBY: Leslie, we've been doing this
every single weekend.

00:31:09.734 --> 00:31:10.702 line:95%,end
It will be fine.

00:31:10.768 --> 00:31:12.136 line:95%,end
You're the new man on the block.

00:31:12.203 --> 00:31:13.771 line:95%,end
-I understand, but guess what?
-Don't make waves.

00:31:13.838 --> 00:31:15.106 line:95%,end
LESLIE: Are they going to hold it for us?

00:31:15.173 --> 00:31:16.407 line:95%,end
Probably not for Leslie Ackerman.

00:31:16.474 --> 00:31:17.809 line:95%,end
Maybe for Abby Lee Miller.

00:31:17.876 --> 00:31:18.710 line:95%,end
Okay.

00:31:18.776 --> 00:31:20.345 line:95%,end
It's my name, my reputation, not yours.

00:31:20.411 --> 00:31:22.146 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: It's their names too.

00:31:22.213 --> 00:31:23.514 line:95%,end

00:31:23.581 --> 00:31:25.450 line:95%,end
but these kids are the ones on the stage.

00:31:25.516 --> 00:31:27.218 line:95%,end
Right, Christi,
they're Abby Lee's these kids.

00:31:27.285 --> 00:31:29.888 line:95%,end
But they're Chloe, and Nia,
and Maddie, and Peyton.

00:31:29.954 --> 00:31:32.123 line:95%,end

00:31:33.491 --> 00:31:35.560 line:95%,end
And for God's sakes,
we are so tired of hearing

00:31:35.627 --> 00:31:36.761 line:95%,end
it's your name. It's not.

00:31:36.828 --> 00:31:40.265 line:95%,end
When Chloe stands on stage,
people are looking at Chloe.

00:31:40.331 --> 00:31:43.234 line:95%,end
<i>When Maddie's on stage,</i>
<i>they're looking at Maddie, and Nia.</i>

00:31:43.301 --> 00:31:46.471 line:95%,end
Yes, they dance under Abby's studio,

00:31:46.537 --> 00:31:49.007 line:95%,end
but ultimately, they're the ones on stage.

00:31:49.073 --> 00:31:50.608 line:95%,end
Paige, come here, honey.

00:31:50.675 --> 00:31:51.943 line:95%,end
She destroys you.

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:53.811 line:95%,end
Don't you say that to my daughter.

JILL: So I love to watch
these girls dance.

00:33:49.093 --> 00:33:51.129 line:5%,start
I totally enjoy the group numbers.

00:33:51.195 --> 00:33:54.866 line:5%,start
However, this one didn't
stick with me too much.

00:33:54.932 --> 00:33:56.267 line:95%,end
It didn't stand out much.

00:33:56.334 --> 00:33:58.202 line:95%,end
<i>The only thing that stood out in my mind</i>

00:33:58.269 --> 00:34:01.973 line:95%,end
<i>was Peyton, because she was</i>
<i>eight feet taller than all the other kids.</i>

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:04.742 line:95%,end
And I'm not sure she pulled
off the bully role very well.

00:34:04.809 --> 00:34:06.878 line:95%,end
What do you think your
critique's going to be?

00:34:06.944 --> 00:34:08.212 line:95%,end
Better than Kendall.

00:34:08.279 --> 00:34:09.480 line:95%,end
Better than Kendall?

00:34:09.547 --> 00:34:10.982 line:95%,end
I thought you did better than Kendall too.

00:34:11.049 --> 00:34:12.517 line:95%,end
PEYTON: Thanks.

00:34:12.583 --> 00:34:13.851 line:95%,end
I think you'll be getting that sweatsuit.

00:34:14.552 --> 00:34:15.753 line:95%,end
ABBY: Peyton, you almost screwed

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:17.688 line:95%,end
the whole entire dance up with the sign.

00:34:17.755 --> 00:34:19.924 line:95%,end
-You can't just like, stick it.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:34:19.991 --> 00:34:21.225 line:95%,end
No, no, whoa, whoa me.

00:34:21.292 --> 00:34:22.994 line:95%,end
-You have to make sure it's on there.
-Melissa's the one who didn't have

00:34:23.061 --> 00:34:24.262 line:95%,end
her daughter's ponytails up high enough.

00:34:24.328 --> 00:34:25.730 line:95%,end
Why you gotta say Peyton did--
it's her fault?

00:34:25.797 --> 00:34:27.265 line:95%,end
Well, yeah, but she has to correct
what she screwed up.

00:34:27.331 --> 00:34:29.801 line:95%,end
No, Abby. It starts from the beginning,
and it--

00:34:29.867 --> 00:34:31.035 line:95%,end
Did you just say, no, Abby?

00:34:31.102 --> 00:34:33.838 line:95%,end
LESLIE: No, Abby.
I thought she did fabulous.

00:34:33.905 --> 00:34:35.273 line:95%,end
Right, and you're not a dance teacher.

00:34:35.339 --> 00:34:36.808 line:95%,end
LESLIE: You tell me
how you thought she did?

00:34:36.874 --> 00:34:37.708 line:95%,end
I thought she was okay.

00:34:37.775 --> 00:34:40.912 line:95%,end
I think your turns, soutenu,
never crossed your thighs once.

00:34:40.978 --> 00:34:42.146 line:95%,end
You need to fix that turn out.

00:34:42.213 --> 00:34:44.382 line:95%,end
I thought that I was better
than most of the people

00:34:44.449 --> 00:34:45.483 line:95%,end
-for all around.
-ABBY: You thought you were better

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:47.151 line:95%,end
-than most of the people in this group?
-PEYTON: Performance-wise.

00:34:49.087 --> 00:34:50.555 line:95%,end
Oh, that's cocky.

00:34:50.621 --> 00:34:52.657 line:95%,end
But that's how I feel, performance wise.

00:34:52.723 --> 00:34:53.858 line:95%,end
(suspenseful music playing)

00:34:53.925 --> 00:34:54.792 line:95%,end
Hmm.

00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:58.429 line:5%,start
I was appalled.

00:34:58.496 --> 00:35:02.600 line:95%,end
I cannot believe that a 14-year-old

00:35:02.667 --> 00:35:05.703 line:95%,end
young adult would open her mouth

00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:08.973 line:95%,end
and act like that
in a room full of amazing dancers.

00:35:09.774 --> 00:35:12.043 line:95%,end
Did you see everyone else dancing?

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:14.412 line:95%,end
That's how I felt.

00:35:14.479 --> 00:35:15.947 line:95%,end
LESLIE: Of course she thought
she did great.

00:35:16.013 --> 00:35:17.982 line:5%,start
You know, every kid and every dancer

00:35:18.049 --> 00:35:21.052 line:5%,start
that gets out on that stage
thinks they're the best dancer.

00:35:21.119 --> 00:35:23.821 line:95%,end
And they think it, they just don't say it.

00:35:23.888 --> 00:35:26.257 line:95%,end
And you know,
Peyton being coerced, she said it.

00:35:26.324 --> 00:35:28.960 line:95%,end
(suspenseful music playing)

00:35:29.026 --> 00:35:32.697 line:95%,end
We have a really nice
camaraderie amongst the girls here,

00:35:32.763 --> 00:35:34.332 line:95%,end
but we don't critique each other.

00:35:34.932 --> 00:35:37.969 line:95%,end
I ask you how you felt about you,
not in comparison

00:35:38.035 --> 00:35:40.271 line:95%,end
to everyone else,
just about your performance.

00:35:40.338 --> 00:35:42.940 line:95%,end
-So everybody was perfect but Peyton?
-No.

00:35:43.007 --> 00:35:44.375 line:95%,end
LESLIE: You didn't critique
one other person.

00:35:44.442 --> 00:35:46.511 line:95%,end
I don't need to.

00:35:46.577 --> 00:35:48.045 line:95%,end
Peyton did for me. (laughs)

00:35:48.112 --> 00:35:50.515 line:95%,end
I don't think there is an apology
to get give the group.

00:35:50.581 --> 00:35:54.519 line:95%,end
She said it, it's out there,
and it was wrong, and it was bad.

00:35:54.585 --> 00:35:57.922 line:95%,end
It will take years to regain their trust.

00:35:58.789 --> 00:36:03.094 line:95%,end
<i>These are her friends,</i>
<i>these are her comrades, this is her team.</i>

00:36:03.161 --> 00:36:05.129 line:95%,end
She shouldn't belittle others.

00:36:05.196 --> 00:36:06.430 line:95%,end
That's my job.

00:36:06.497 --> 00:36:08.699 line:95%,end

I was kind of relieved.

00:38:16.427 --> 00:38:17.862 line:95%,end
Hello.

(dramatic music playing)

00:38:22.466 --> 00:38:24.802 line:95%,end
Remember, I told you,
getting on top of that pyramid

00:38:24.869 --> 00:38:26.804 line:95%,end
is one thing, staying there's another.

00:38:26.871 --> 00:38:28.539 line:95%,end
No matter who your competition is,

00:38:28.606 --> 00:38:30.141 line:95%,end
no matter how long they've been doing it,

00:38:30.207 --> 00:38:32.410 line:95%,end
doesn't matter
if you're in that age category,

00:38:32.476 --> 00:38:34.245 line:95%,end
I want you to win that age category.

00:38:34.312 --> 00:38:36.380 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>It's so funny,</i>
<i>because Chloe finally earned her way</i>

00:38:36.447 --> 00:38:39.317 line:5%,start
to the top of the pyramid,
and Abby has said some things to her

00:38:39.383 --> 00:38:41.118 line:95%,end
<i>that are so out of line.</i>

00:38:41.185 --> 00:38:43.521 line:95%,end
<i>I've never heard her say</i>
<i>those things to Maddie.</i>

00:38:44.221 --> 00:38:45.723 line:95%,end
But there's no favoritism.

00:38:47.692 --> 00:38:51.495 line:95%,end
ABBY: So Peyton,
how about that overinflated ego, huh?

00:38:52.063 --> 00:38:54.098 line:95%,end
This group's been winning,
winning, winning, winning.

00:38:54.165 --> 00:38:55.466 line:95%,end
Do you think they lost because of her?

00:38:55.533 --> 00:38:57.001 line:95%,end
I don't know, I don't know.

00:38:57.068 --> 00:38:59.036 line:95%,end
I'll have to read the judge's comments

00:38:59.103 --> 00:39:01.572 line:95%,end
and listen to the critiques
and see what they say.

00:39:01.639 --> 00:39:04.075 line:95%,end
Is she going to be able to dance
with the team again?

00:39:04.141 --> 00:39:05.076 line:95%,end
ABBY: I don't know.

00:39:05.142 --> 00:39:09.380 line:95%,end
I don't think what she did on stage
really is what my concern is.

00:39:09.447 --> 00:39:11.415 line:95%,end
It was coming back to the dressing room

00:39:11.482 --> 00:39:13.517 line:95%,end
and saying that she was fabulous
and everybody else stunk.

00:39:13.584 --> 00:39:14.919 line:95%,end
You know what, you flustered her.

00:39:14.985 --> 00:39:16.253 line:95%,end
She didn't mean it like that.

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:17.822 line:95%,end
You're talking to your 14-year-old.

00:39:17.888 --> 00:39:19.323 line:95%,end
If you want to fight with somebody,

00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:20.758 line:95%,end
then you fight with me, her mother.

00:39:20.825 --> 00:39:22.426 line:95%,end
ABBY: It's not about fighting, Leslie.

00:39:22.493 --> 00:39:24.528 line:95%,end
If you can't say anything nice,
don't say anything at all.

00:39:24.595 --> 00:39:26.897 line:95%,end
But it's different.
People are paying me for my opinion.

00:39:26.964 --> 00:39:29.233 line:95%,end
So you are still on probation.

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:31.268 line:95%,end
You know, Peyton's sassy little mouth

00:39:31.335 --> 00:39:35.973 line:95%,end
may have just ruined her chances
of getting off probation.

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:38.976 line:95%,end
Maybe even getting on
this competition team.

00:39:39.043 --> 00:39:42.313 line:95%,end
-Abby's really mad at Peyton.
-LESLIE: Why?

00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:45.716 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Because of the way it came out
Peyton was talking about

00:39:45.783 --> 00:39:47.251 line:95%,end
the rest of the group dance

00:39:47.318 --> 00:39:49.854 line:95%,end
and her performance in comparison
to everyone else.

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:52.923 line:95%,end
I will speak for myself, I took it
the same way the Abby said it.

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:55.926 line:95%,end
Wait, wait, and then she apologized,
then you're still saying this to me?

00:39:55.993 --> 00:39:57.561 line:95%,end
Are you going to let me finish my comment?

00:39:57.628 --> 00:39:59.563 line:95%,end
Well, because I'm pissed off, that's why.

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:01.732 line:95%,end
You don't accept apologies
from a 14-year-old?

00:40:01.799 --> 00:40:03.934 line:95%,end
I did accept her apology.

00:40:04.001 --> 00:40:05.603 line:95%,end
-But--
-No, no, no, no.

00:40:05.669 --> 00:40:07.304 line:95%,end
There's a lot of enabling going on.

00:40:07.371 --> 00:40:09.240 line:95%,end
Somebody shut you down,
and you can't handle it.

00:40:09.306 --> 00:40:10.441 line:95%,end
CHRISTI:
You aren't shutting me down, Leslie.

00:40:10.508 --> 00:40:11.475 line:95%,end
Yes, I did.

00:40:11.542 --> 00:40:13.744 line:95%,end
Ladies, I'm standing outside

00:40:13.811 --> 00:40:15.112 line:95%,end
with a dance teacher
that's a friend of mine,

00:40:15.179 --> 00:40:16.881 line:95%,end
and I can hear every word you're saying.

00:40:16.947 --> 00:40:17.982 line:95%,end
I'm still upset, Abby.

00:40:18.048 --> 00:40:19.583 line:95%,end
I know, but Leslie, you know what?

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:21.085 line:95%,end
Your daughter's 14 years old.

00:40:21.152 --> 00:40:23.354 line:95%,end
You say that she's a grown up,
she's this, she's that.

00:40:23.421 --> 00:40:24.822 line:95%,end
She has a smart mouth on her,

00:40:24.889 --> 00:40:26.657 line:95%,end
you need to dig your
fingernails into her back

00:40:26.724 --> 00:40:28.159 line:95%,end
-and tell her to shut her mouth.
-Okay, stop.

00:40:28.225 --> 00:40:31.228 line:95%,end
Did you not put her on the spot
that brought her to that point

00:40:31.295 --> 00:40:33.364 line:95%,end
where she said something wrong
and apologize to you?

00:40:33.431 --> 00:40:36.801 line:95%,end
You did not put her on this team
because of her comment.

00:40:36.867 --> 00:40:38.235 line:95%,end
That's what I want to know.

00:40:38.302 --> 00:40:40.137 line:95%,end
-Yes.
-Then that's a shame.

00:40:40.204 --> 00:40:42.740 line:95%,end
Shame on you, and I hope
you feel better

00:40:42.807 --> 00:40:44.275 line:95%,end
-laying your head down on your pillow.
-No shame on me.

00:40:44.341 --> 00:40:45.342 line:5%,start
Don't shame on me.

00:40:45.409 --> 00:40:46.677 line:5%,start
LESLIE: You gonna
kick her off to the curb?

00:40:46.744 --> 00:40:48.846 line:5%,start
You don't walk into a dressing room
with a whole group of people

00:40:48.913 --> 00:40:51.282 line:5%,start
and say, I was fabulous,
and you all weren't.

00:40:51.348 --> 00:40:53.184 line:5%,start
-It's ridiculous.
-LESLIE: No, you pick--

00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:54.452 line:5%,start
you let her daughter off probation.

00:40:54.518 --> 00:40:55.619 line:5%,start
-That's why.
-You don't need to be here.

00:40:55.686 --> 00:40:58.989 line:5%,start
You said, you can find a dance
to put her in, I did.

00:40:59.056 --> 00:41:01.058 line:5%,start
If Peyton wouldn't have been in that,
that would have been Chloe's spot.

00:41:01.125 --> 00:41:04.862 line:5%,start
She came in here
and had this snotty little attitude,

00:41:04.929 --> 00:41:06.297 line:5%,start
and you back her up.

00:41:06.997 --> 00:41:08.933 line:5%,start
I don't think you guys will have to
put up with me much longer.

00:41:08.999 --> 00:41:10.334 line:5%,start
I'll be gone, this will be it.

00:41:10.401 --> 00:41:11.902 line:5%,start
(sobbing)

00:41:11.969 --> 00:41:13.971 line:5%,start
(tense music playing)
