-You're kidding me, right?
-ABBY: No.

00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:23.590 line:5%,start
I don't have to buy
my way through life, Jill.

I mean, let's just get it
over with quickly.

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:27.460 line:5%,start
Please, that's official.
I do not want to say.

Get the hell out! Go!

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.402 line:5%,start
I don't think you guys have to put up
with me much longer, I'll be gone.

00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:37.337 line:5%,start
Kiss, kiss. Let's go.

-No!
-(gasps)

What did she say?

00:00:39.572 --> 00:00:40.673 line:5%,start
Be gone, bitch!

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.442 line:5%,start
You have no powers here.

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:43.977 line:5%,start
I didn't sign up for this.

-Stop screaming at our kids.
-Okay.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.248 line:5%,start
Don't scream at my kids.

ABBY: <i>When we got off of the bus,</i>

I told my girls and their mothers,

CATHY: Abby Lee, she draws on abs.

00:01:36.496 --> 00:01:37.697 line:95%,end

Keep your heads up high, all right?

00:01:43.136 --> 00:01:45.038 line:95%,end
And remember, no running,
hugging, kissing,

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:46.439 line:95%,end
just, "Hi, how are you?"

00:01:46.506 --> 00:01:47.540 line:95%,end
Guys, guys, guys, guys, come here.

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:48.641 line:95%,end
Don't even look at them.

(tense music playing)

00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:31.851 line:95%,end
As a mom, I'm seeing like
bare midriffs and fishnets.

00:02:31.918 --> 00:02:33.820 line:95%,end
LESLIE: Yep, and the fishnets
and school girl.

00:02:33.887 --> 00:02:35.355 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Right, it's just--

00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:36.422 line:95%,end
it's over the top.

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.424 line:95%,end
LESLIE: Well, I like fishnets.
I think they're cute.

00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:39.726 line:95%,end
I don't get the holes in the tights.

00:02:39.792 --> 00:02:40.960 line:95%,end
ABBY: You don't need to get it.

00:02:41.027 --> 00:02:42.095 line:95%,end
-You're not judging.
-LESLIE: Okay.

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:43.263 line:95%,end
ABBY: Don't worry about it.

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:44.697 line:95%,end
You have to understand, Leslie.

00:02:44.764 --> 00:02:46.232 line:95%,end
I'm going with Payton as a bully.

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:47.600 line:95%,end
She's older.

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:51.171 line:95%,end
She would be like the trashy, mean,

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:53.873 line:95%,end
bad girl that's up to no good
at Catholic school.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.108 line:95%,end
That's what I'm going for.

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:58.011 line:95%,end
LESLIE: Bully and bad girl
is different from trashy, Abby.

00:02:58.077 --> 00:02:59.512 line:95%,end
-The judges--
-LESLIE: Trashy means sleazy, sloppy.

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.381 line:95%,end
-ABBY: No. I--
-LESLIE: She's 14.

00:03:01.447 --> 00:03:04.250 line:95%,end
She's not--that's not what--
she's portraying a bully,

00:03:04.317 --> 00:03:06.686 line:95%,end
not some sleaze in some strip joint.

00:03:06.753 --> 00:03:08.755 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>I don't care what any</i>

00:03:08.821 --> 00:03:09.956 line:95%,end
<i>It's my studio.</i>

<i>It's my company.</i>

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:14.227 line:95%,end
<i>And they needed something</i>
<i>cutting edge for this routine.</i>

00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:17.664 line:95%,end
I have two minutes to convey
my message to the audience.

00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:20.333 line:95%,end
Instantly when that music starts,

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.303 line:95%,end
the judges need to know
what the piece is about.

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:26.906 line:95%,end
So I don't have time to explain it all
like Leslie's explaining it.

00:03:27.307 --> 00:03:31.211 line:95%,end
I want the costumes to be
over the top, in your face,


00:03:31.277 --> 00:03:32.545 line:95%,end
I get what you mean.

00:03:32.912 --> 00:03:34.047 line:95%,end
That's all there is to it.

00:03:34.414 --> 00:03:38.718 line:95%,end
<i>And now, number 18 of my OMG moments.</i>

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:41.354 line:95%,end
JILL: Kendall and I have
a little something for you,

00:03:41.421 --> 00:03:43.523 line:95%,end
for letting us in on your family.

00:03:44.257 --> 00:03:47.460 line:95%,end
<i>I bought Abby a gift</i>
<i>as a token of my appreciation.</i>

00:03:47.527 --> 00:03:50.029 line:95%,end
And I wanted to give it to her
in front of all the other moms

00:03:50.096 --> 00:03:53.099 line:95%,end
because I want them to know
that I'm serious about this.

00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:54.634 line:95%,end
-What is it? Perfume and--
-It's the Chanel--

00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:57.870 line:95%,end
-Is that the--that's Number 5.
-And the (indistinct) that's it.

<i>I wanted to die.</i>

here's another Melissa."

"Gift giver."

I think I've seen it all now.

No one has ever done anything
like this my whole entire life.

JILL: I'm going to do my best to make sure
that Abby gets taken care of.

You know, I think (indistinct)
done this for us.

00:04:54.594 --> 00:04:55.461 line:95%,end
Never.

00:04:55.528 --> 00:04:56.496 line:95%,end
Hi.

00:04:56.562 --> 00:04:57.864 line:95%,end
Oh, were you having a private?

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.032 line:95%,end
JILL: No, I wish.

00:04:59.098 --> 00:05:00.433 line:95%,end
I just came through.

-Christi, it's not of your business.

Just tell us if it was nothing.

Oh.

CHRISTI: Abby is a really big advocate
for, you know, pay me off, give me a gift.

00:05:15.948 --> 00:05:18.251 line:95%,end
But this is taking gifting
to a whole new level.

HOLLY: That doesn't look like nothing.

00:05:19.619 --> 00:05:21.321 line:95%,end
And that poor masseuse.

-Did you--
-Well, you know what?

You guys, it really wasn't
really your business.

00:05:25.458 --> 00:05:27.427 line:95%,end
Yes, I did something nice for Abby.

she was taking meds.

And I think she ran out.

You are buying Abby and Gianna right now.

that's your choice.

You better not say that again!

to Weight Watchers
if I were to give her a gift.

It's the gift that would keep on giving.

No.

I wasn't at pyramid.

I'm the adult.
Nia has no control over me.

00:06:13.072 --> 00:06:16.442 line:95%,end

I wasn't present for pyramid.

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:28.821 line:95%,end

00:06:28.888 --> 00:06:30.223 line:95%,end
That's your problem, Abby.

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:32.191 line:95%,end
You are intimidated by me because I--

00:06:32.258 --> 00:06:33.092 line:95%,end
Bull!

00:06:34.293 --> 00:06:35.461 line:95%,end

-It's ridiculous.
-Fine, you go ahead and do that.

00:07:02.221 --> 00:07:03.856 line:95%,end
I have parents who do that all the time.

00:07:03.923 --> 00:07:07.627 line:95%,end

-It's my office.
-What you fail--

00:07:16.736 --> 00:07:18.304 line:95%,end
what you fail to realize, Abby...

00:07:18.371 --> 00:07:20.673 line:95%,end
-I don't fail to realize anything.

ABBY: I will not be bossed
around in my own studio.

00:07:23.876 --> 00:07:26.913 line:95%,end

Detention is good enough.

00:07:30.616 --> 00:07:32.819 line:95%,end
And that's what her and Nia both need.

00:07:32.885 --> 00:07:34.287 line:95%,end
Get the hell out! Go!

Let her carry it herself.

00:08:10.256 --> 00:08:12.091 line:95%,end
She didn't know I brought a hat.

Because you just told Nia
her mom didn't love her.

I want you to be gone.

00:08:25.505 --> 00:08:27.173 line:95%,end

CATHY: Hi, guys.

00:11:58.984 --> 00:12:00.286 line:95%,end
ABBY: Hello.

00:12:00.352 --> 00:12:02.154 line:95%,end
-How are you?
-ABBY: Good.

00:12:02.221 --> 00:12:04.690 line:95%,end
CATHY:
Just wanted to tell you that your red

00:12:04.757 --> 00:12:07.259 line:95%,end
was such a nice tribute to candy apples.

00:12:07.326 --> 00:12:11.163 line:95%,end
That woman went right to nasty,
rotten to the core.

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:14.200 line:95%,end
The moms were telling me
that you were really...

00:12:14.266 --> 00:12:15.634 line:95%,end
-Oh, you know what?
-...kind of dissing me

00:12:15.701 --> 00:12:18.037 line:95%,end
-and wondering why they're still with me?
-I'm going to tell you--

00:12:18.104 --> 00:12:19.905 line:95%,end
-Just questioning--
-Cathy, something tells me,

00:12:19.972 --> 00:12:21.640 line:95%,end
-you would love to have us.
-CATHY: Time out. Time--

00:12:21.707 --> 00:12:23.809 line:95%,end
Oh, you think way too highly of yourself,

00:12:23.876 --> 00:12:25.010 line:95%,end
especially the way you dress.

00:12:25.077 --> 00:12:26.579 line:95%,end
-Listen Granny...
-Wait a minute, you know what Christi?

00:12:26.645 --> 00:12:28.981 line:95%,end
-...take it out to the hallway.
-Listen, all right, listen, nose.

00:12:29.048 --> 00:12:33.119 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Leave it to Cathy
to take it to a below the belt level.

00:12:33.185 --> 00:12:38.023 line:95%,end
You've done nothing
but complain about her forever.

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:39.692 line:95%,end
You need to take your cheap dress

00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:41.026 line:95%,end
-and mosey on out.
-My dress is not cheap,

00:12:41.093 --> 00:12:42.128 line:95%,end
it's Ralph Lauren there, honey.

00:12:42.194 --> 00:12:43.262 line:95%,end
CATHY: Oh, I highly doubt it.

00:12:43.329 --> 00:12:45.064 line:95%,end
-Oh.
-CHRISTI: Go back to junior high, Grandma.

00:12:45.131 --> 00:12:48.234 line:95%,end
Cathy is the geriatric mean girl.

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:49.401 line:95%,end
Be gone, bitch.

00:12:49.468 --> 00:12:51.537 line:95%,end
You have no powers here.

00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:53.839 line:95%,end
Wow, I think I'm seeing red.

00:12:53.906 --> 00:12:56.075 line:95%,end
I just wish Christi would act like a lady

00:12:56.142 --> 00:12:57.810 line:95%,end
and quit going after Cathy.

00:12:57.877 --> 00:13:00.312 line:95%,end
Obviously, she's a bitter old snot.

00:13:00.379 --> 00:13:01.614 line:95%,end
It's not going to get any better.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:02.715 line:95%,end
She's jealous.

00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:04.016 line:95%,end
Let's just move on.

00:13:04.083 --> 00:13:05.284 line:95%,end
No fighting, ladies.

00:13:05.951 --> 00:13:08.888 line:95%,end
<i>Number 13 of my OMG moments.</i>

00:13:10.856 --> 00:13:12.391 line:95%,end
Back to the drawing board,

00:13:13.793 --> 00:13:16.362 line:95%,end
new number starting tomorrow.

00:13:16.962 --> 00:13:20.633 line:95%,end
KELLY: You're the one that wants them
to learn a new dance every three days.

00:13:20.699 --> 00:13:22.968 line:95%,end
Everybody else out there,
I can guarantee you,


00:13:23.035 --> 00:13:25.471 line:95%,end
have been doing their numbers
more than three days.

00:13:25.538 --> 00:13:27.339 line:95%,end
How come I'm the only one
that gets aggravated?

00:13:27.406 --> 00:13:29.809 line:95%,end
Because you're the only one
that hasn't had a child.

00:13:29.875 --> 00:13:32.077 line:95%,end
No, but I had a mother and a father.

00:13:32.144 --> 00:13:36.715 line:95%,end
And if they looked at me one time,
I knew, one look.

00:13:36.782 --> 00:13:39.485 line:95%,end
So I'm telling you right now,
it's 4:30 to 9:30

00:13:39.552 --> 00:13:41.821 line:95%,end
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday.

00:13:41.887 --> 00:13:42.721 line:95%,end
Plan on it.

00:13:42.788 --> 00:13:45.558 line:95%,end
<i>I'm allowed to say</i>
<i>the routine wasn't good.</i>

00:13:45.624 --> 00:13:49.361 line:95%,end
Most parents value my opinion
more than the three judges.

00:13:49.428 --> 00:13:50.262 line:95%,end
Whatever, Abby.

00:13:50.329 --> 00:13:51.664 line:95%,end
<i>I was so frustrated.</i>

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:55.334 line:95%,end
I'm just not the kind of person
that's going to sit back and shut up.

00:13:55.401 --> 00:13:57.369 line:95%,end
No, I don't have to pay on time.
I'm Kelly Hyland.

00:13:57.436 --> 00:13:58.704 line:95%,end
I've been at this for 30 years.

00:13:58.771 --> 00:14:00.472 line:95%,end
KELLY: No, I always pay
the whole year on time.

00:14:00.539 --> 00:14:02.341 line:95%,end
Because I'll show you
my Discover card payment

00:14:02.408 --> 00:14:04.977 line:95%,end
that shows for the past ten years,
I've paid you in full.

00:14:05.044 --> 00:14:06.912 line:95%,end
You're the reason I don't
even take Discover any more.

00:14:08.747 --> 00:14:09.915 line:95%,end
Kelly, go get a job!

00:14:09.982 --> 00:14:12.184 line:95%,end
KELLY: Oh, don't even go there, you whore.

00:14:12.852 --> 00:14:14.720 line:95%,end
Oh, you are a whore.

00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:19.491 line:95%,end
Kelly, we're not talking
about you in high school.

00:14:19.558 --> 00:14:23.963 line:95%,end
We're talking about learning a routine
for dance competition every single week.

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:25.397 line:95%,end
Come on, honey.

00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:28.067 line:95%,end
Take those beady little eyes
and stay with me.

00:14:28.534 --> 00:14:32.104 line:95%,end
<i>And now number 12 of my OMG moments.</i>

00:14:33.172 --> 00:14:35.474 line:95%,end
They need to go home
before somebody gets hurt.

00:14:35.541 --> 00:14:37.176 line:95%,end
Girls, I don't need the tears.

00:14:37.243 --> 00:14:39.144 line:95%,end
You're nine, ten, 11 years old.

00:14:39.211 --> 00:14:40.212 line:95%,end
Exactly!

00:14:42.581 --> 00:14:44.183 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>Every kid makes mistakes.</i>

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:47.853 line:95%,end
These mothers are enabling their children

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.155 line:95%,end
to make mistakes and not own them.

00:14:50.756 --> 00:14:52.791 line:95%,end
My daughter was at the top of the pyramid

00:14:52.858 --> 00:14:55.261 line:95%,end
and she's leaving the studio crying.

00:14:55.327 --> 00:14:58.130 line:95%,end
This is why I say (bleep) the pyramid.

00:14:58.197 --> 00:14:59.465 line:95%,end
Yay.

00:14:59.531 --> 00:15:00.900 line:95%,end
Are all the tears over?

00:15:00.966 --> 00:15:03.068 line:95%,end
-KELLY: School tomorrow.
-What are all the tears about?

00:15:03.135 --> 00:15:04.436 line:95%,end
I don't understand.

00:15:04.503 --> 00:15:06.071 line:95%,end
-Why are you crying?
-CHRISTI: You don't understand?

00:15:06.138 --> 00:15:07.072 line:95%,end
No.

00:15:07.139 --> 00:15:09.775 line:95%,end
Because you're screaming
in little kids' faces.

00:15:09.842 --> 00:15:10.843 line:95%,end
Little kids' faces.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:12.244 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Yeah, little kids' faces, Abby.

00:15:12.311 --> 00:15:13.212 line:95%,end
Grow up!

00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:14.446 line:95%,end
You grow up!

00:15:14.513 --> 00:15:15.614 line:95%,end
<i>Abby is the best.</i>

00:15:15.681 --> 00:15:17.683 line:95%,end
The girls, they were just being taught

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.286 line:95%,end
the things that they forgot
about the trio.

00:15:20.352 --> 00:15:21.687 line:95%,end
It was no big deal.

00:15:21.754 --> 00:15:24.456 line:95%,end
<i>I think the moms need to get a grip.</i>

00:15:24.523 --> 00:15:26.025 line:95%,end
-You know what, Abby?
-ABBY: I wouldn't yell at her!

00:15:26.091 --> 00:15:27.826 line:95%,end
(indistinct) be so lucky
to have Chloe as your student

00:15:27.893 --> 00:15:29.995 line:95%,end
because she's a great dancer
and everybody knows it

00:15:30.062 --> 00:15:30.930 line:95%,end
except for you.

00:15:31.563 --> 00:15:32.464 line:95%,end
I made her.

00:15:32.531 --> 00:15:33.666 line:95%,end
I know it.

00:15:33.732 --> 00:15:35.334 line:95%,end
Oh, were you pregnant for nine months?

00:15:35.401 --> 00:15:36.568 line:95%,end
I made her!

00:15:36.635 --> 00:15:37.536 line:95%,end
You know what?

00:15:37.603 --> 00:15:39.772 line:95%,end
You couldn't have given (bleep)
about her for so many years

00:15:39.838 --> 00:15:41.807 line:95%,end
when I sat out there
and I told her what to do

00:15:41.874 --> 00:15:44.543 line:95%,end
because you were too busy
looking at everybody else.

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:45.945 line:95%,end
Oh who else was I looking at?

00:15:46.011 --> 00:15:47.680 line:95%,end
-Oh, let me guess.
-ABBY: Everybody.

00:15:47.746 --> 00:15:49.381 line:95%,end
-Who?
-Who else?

00:15:49.448 --> 00:15:53.519 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>Abby does not put any value</i>
<i>on any child in her studio</i>

00:15:53.585 --> 00:15:54.486 line:95%,end
except for Maddie.

00:15:54.553 --> 00:15:55.521 line:95%,end
And those kids know it.

00:15:55.587 --> 00:15:56.889 line:95%,end
And it is a shame.

00:15:58.190 --> 00:15:59.591 line:95%,end
Disrespectful.

00:15:59.992 --> 00:16:02.361 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: You're like the definition
of disrespectful.

00:16:02.428 --> 00:16:03.662 line:95%,end
Well, my mother would have came in

00:16:03.729 --> 00:16:06.298 line:95%,end
and beat my butt
when I couldn't count to eight.

00:16:07.032 --> 00:16:08.867 line:95%,end
She would have been mortified.

00:16:09.768 --> 00:16:10.836 line:95%,end
White trash.

00:16:11.303 --> 00:16:13.105 line:95%,end
I didn't sign up for this.

00:18:08.854 --> 00:18:11.657 line:95%,end
If you don't want to do it again
next year, by all means,

00:18:11.723 --> 00:18:13.058 line:95%,end
don't sign up again.

00:18:13.125 --> 00:18:16.328 line:95%,end
<i>Number ten of my OMG moments.</i>

00:18:18.163 --> 00:18:19.631 line:95%,end
I just think everyone
should be treated fairly.

00:18:19.698 --> 00:18:20.532 line:95%,end
Exactly.

00:18:20.599 --> 00:18:22.568 line:95%,end
It's blatant why your daughter
gets everything

00:18:22.634 --> 00:18:26.138 line:95%,end
because you do everything in your power
to get Maddie ahead.

00:18:26.205 --> 00:18:28.607 line:95%,end
-No, I don't.
-CHRISTI: Yes, you do, Melissa.

00:18:28.674 --> 00:18:30.476 line:95%,end
I don't think you should have
to defend yourself...

00:18:30.542 --> 00:18:32.444 line:95%,end
-I don't.
-...for something Abby gives your kids.

00:18:32.511 --> 00:18:35.481 line:95%,end
I don't think it's Melissa's fault
that Abby likes her kids the best.

00:18:35.547 --> 00:18:37.649 line:95%,end
Let's face it, she does.

00:18:37.716 --> 00:18:39.785 line:95%,end
So her kids get the privates.

00:18:39.852 --> 00:18:41.887 line:95%,end
You make sure that
nobody else has a chance

00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:43.322 line:95%,end
because of all the things you do.

00:18:43.388 --> 00:18:45.257 line:95%,end
Oh, please, that is such (bleep).

00:18:45.324 --> 00:18:46.425 line:95%,end
That's why I didn't want to come.

00:18:46.492 --> 00:18:47.893 line:95%,end
-So I'm leaving.
-CHRISTI: Go ahead.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.395 line:95%,end
We knew you would leave
because you deflect everything.

00:18:50.462 --> 00:18:52.531 line:95%,end
I don't argue because I'm not like you.

00:18:52.598 --> 00:18:54.099 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: No, you're not, Melissa.

00:18:54.166 --> 00:18:56.301 line:95%,end
And I'm not like you, thank God.

00:18:56.368 --> 00:18:59.338 line:95%,end
JILL: <i>I can't believe that Kelly</i>
<i>is allowing this to happen.</i>

00:18:59.404 --> 00:19:01.173 line:95%,end
Is this how you throw a party?

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:02.441 line:95%,end
Get out.

00:19:03.709 --> 00:19:04.676 line:95%,end
Come on, baby.

00:19:05.677 --> 00:19:08.413 line:95%,end
JILL: Why do you have to get
so personal about it?

00:19:09.148 --> 00:19:12.351 line:95%,end
And I believe that if any one of you
did what Melissa did

00:19:12.417 --> 00:19:14.052 line:95%,end
and got the privates that she gets

00:19:14.119 --> 00:19:16.488 line:95%,end
and had your child up top all the time,

00:19:16.555 --> 00:19:18.690 line:95%,end
-you would feel the same way she does?
-But we're not willing to do it.

00:19:18.757 --> 00:19:20.859 line:95%,end
We're not willing to sell
our soul to the devil

00:19:20.926 --> 00:19:22.761 line:95%,end
-to get to the top of the pyramid.
-JILL: And that's your decision.

00:19:22.828 --> 00:19:25.063 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>Jill is really turning</i>
<i>this group upside down.</i>

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:27.432 line:95%,end
<i>And she thinks she can come</i>
<i>in here and tell us how to be.</i>

00:19:27.499 --> 00:19:28.901 line:95%,end
Guess what?

00:19:28.967 --> 00:19:30.269 line:95%,end
Can't do that.

00:19:30.335 --> 00:19:33.071 line:95%,end
-Hey, new girl, see yourself out.
-I gotta go. I got to go.

00:19:33.138 --> 00:19:34.506 line:95%,end
Thank you, Kelly, for your hospitality.

00:19:34.573 --> 00:19:35.741 line:95%,end
You're welcome.

00:19:36.208 --> 00:19:39.044 line:95%,end
It's amazing how things have changed
once you're off probation.

00:19:40.479 --> 00:19:42.614 line:95%,end
I have one comment to make.

00:19:43.148 --> 00:19:46.351 line:95%,end
Did everybody see Christi shove her food

00:19:46.418 --> 00:19:48.187 line:95%,end
<i>onto her cracker with her finger</i>

00:19:48.253 --> 00:19:51.256 line:95%,end
and down it without even chewing?

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:54.760 line:95%,end
Woo, that's some hypo she has.

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:59.231 line:95%,end
<i>And now number nine of my OMG moments.</i>

00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:02.301 line:95%,end
I hate to do this, but...

00:20:04.636 --> 00:20:08.507 line:95%,end
Kendall, you are back on probation.

00:20:10.342 --> 00:20:13.278 line:95%,end
That's ridiculous, Abby.

00:20:13.345 --> 00:20:16.448 line:95%,end
What more do you want from her?

00:20:16.949 --> 00:20:18.317 line:95%,end
ABBY: Your head is distended.

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:20.152 line:95%,end
Your shoulders are hunched.

00:20:20.452 --> 00:20:21.987 line:95%,end
Your rib cage is open.

00:20:22.054 --> 00:20:23.455 line:95%,end
Are you kidding me?

00:20:23.522 --> 00:20:24.790 line:95%,end
You're kidding me, right?

00:20:25.257 --> 00:20:28.894 line:95%,end
ABBY:
No, she doesn't make the corrections.


00:20:28.961 --> 00:20:33.131 line:95%,end
I have been telling her since
the audition about her posture.

00:20:33.198 --> 00:20:34.933 line:95%,end
And it has not improved once.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.802 line:95%,end
JILL: I can't even believe it.
You know what?

00:20:36.868 --> 00:20:39.972 line:95%,end
You should be on probation,
not my daughter.

00:20:40.672 --> 00:20:42.007 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>Kendall was on the bottom</i>
<i>of the pyramid.</i>

00:20:42.541 --> 00:20:45.110 line:95%,end
Unfortunately,
I don't have a picture of Jill.

00:20:45.611 --> 00:20:48.213 line:95%,end
If I would, she would be
the one that's there.

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.148 line:95%,end
<i>Learn something, Jill.</i>

00:20:50.215 --> 00:20:51.883 line:95%,end
You are on my last nerve.

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:53.819 line:95%,end
I don't even know why I'm here.

00:20:53.885 --> 00:20:58.423 line:95%,end
You had nothing to say to her
since the second we got here.

00:20:58.490 --> 00:20:59.458 line:95%,end
You know what, Abby?

00:20:59.524 --> 00:21:00.859 line:95%,end
She does a lot right.

00:21:00.926 --> 00:21:05.163 line:95%,end
ABBY: I was not surprised
in the least by Jill's reaction.

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:09.368 line:95%,end
I was devastated by Kendall's reaction.

00:21:09.434 --> 00:21:13.038 line:95%,end
<i>I certainly don't wake up</i>
<i>in the morning to intentionally</i>

00:21:13.105 --> 00:21:15.040 line:95%,end
<i>hurt a child's feelings.</i>

00:21:15.107 --> 00:21:16.642 line:95%,end
There's a lot of studios out there

00:21:16.708 --> 00:21:19.177 line:95%,end
who would love what she does right.

00:21:19.244 --> 00:21:20.712 line:95%,end
And you know what, Abby?

00:21:21.513 --> 00:21:24.216 line:95%,end
We're going to one of those studios.

00:21:24.283 --> 00:21:26.952 line:95%,end
I'm not putting up with this crap anymore.

00:21:27.019 --> 00:21:28.253 line:95%,end
We're done.

00:21:28.787 --> 00:21:32.157 line:95%,end
Jill took Kendall over
to Cathy's Candy Apples.

00:21:35.127 --> 00:21:38.263 line:95%,end
<i>Number eight of my OMG moments.</i>

00:21:39.431 --> 00:21:42.067 line:95%,end
I still stand by my decision
that my daughter dances.

00:21:42.134 --> 00:21:44.970 line:95%,end
And whatever number is put there,
she's going to do

00:21:45.037 --> 00:21:46.438 line:95%,end
and she's going to act out that part.

00:21:46.505 --> 00:21:48.540 line:95%,end
And that's what my kids are going to do.

00:21:48.607 --> 00:21:50.475 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: She told me last night
that she has got somebody

00:21:50.542 --> 00:21:51.677 line:95%,end
on speed dial to replace her.

00:21:51.743 --> 00:21:52.878 line:95%,end
No, she just says that.

00:21:52.944 --> 00:21:54.780 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I know,
but it makes my daughter cry.

00:21:54.846 --> 00:21:56.648 line:95%,end
-(interposing voices)
-But you still bring your daughter back

00:21:56.715 --> 00:21:58.750 line:95%,end
to cry the next day.
I don't get it.

00:21:58.817 --> 00:21:59.918 line:95%,end
-Well, you don't have to get it.
-(interposing voices)

00:21:59.985 --> 00:22:01.920 line:95%,end
You listen to Payton
when Abby says something to her,

00:22:01.987 --> 00:22:03.088 line:95%,end
shut up and take it.

00:22:03.155 --> 00:22:06.258 line:95%,end
Or find a new studio, Payton,
that you don't feel this way

00:22:06.325 --> 00:22:07.259 line:95%,end
when you leave here.

00:22:07.326 --> 00:22:08.593 line:95%,end
That's your opinion about the situation.

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:10.128 line:95%,end
-Well, if you feel that bad...
-Mine is different.

00:22:10.195 --> 00:22:12.864 line:95%,end
...that your daughter is crying
and you don't take her somewhere else,

00:22:12.931 --> 00:22:15.434 line:95%,end
Christi, then what kind
of parenting is that?

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:17.436 line:95%,end
Because it doesn't bother me
that Payton cries.

00:22:18.337 --> 00:22:20.138 line:95%,end
CHRISTI:
But it still doesn't make it any easier

00:22:20.205 --> 00:22:22.541 line:95%,end
-when I'm watching my daughter cry.
-Then shut up.

00:22:22.607 --> 00:22:24.910 line:95%,end
No one's holding a gun to your head
and driving you here.

00:22:25.177 --> 00:22:26.678 line:95%,end
Go somewhere else.
Like where--

00:22:26.745 --> 00:22:29.081 line:95%,end
-Leslie--
-Go somewhere else.

00:22:29.548 --> 00:22:31.850 line:95%,end
Well, I think Leslie is right.

00:22:31.917 --> 00:22:33.218 line:95%,end
She's right on the money.

00:22:33.285 --> 00:22:34.720 line:95%,end
Put up or shut up.

00:22:34.786 --> 00:22:37.189 line:95%,end
If you're going to cry, go somewhere else.

00:22:37.889 --> 00:22:40.692 line:95%,end

<i>You're going to start from this side.</i>

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:49.334 line:95%,end
And if I had to do a close-up,
I would be going over here.

00:22:49.401 --> 00:22:50.469 line:95%,end
Yeah, okay.

00:22:50.535 --> 00:22:52.804 line:95%,end
So we want this production to be huge.

00:22:52.871 --> 00:22:57.242 line:95%,end

MAN: Do you want to do
a panning shot across everyone

00:23:02.447 --> 00:23:03.949 line:95%,end
and then zoom out and then
you're going to see--

00:23:04.015 --> 00:23:06.051 line:95%,end
No, no, we've got to
make it work this way.

00:23:06.118 --> 00:23:06.952 line:95%,end
-Yeah.
-Doesn't the director

00:23:07.018 --> 00:23:08.520 line:95%,end
always have their final say?

00:23:09.421 --> 00:23:10.756 line:95%,end
Yeah, you know,
on a project like this, sure.

00:23:10.822 --> 00:23:11.823 line:95%,end
Okay, then, that's all I need to know.

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:13.091 line:95%,end
-Whoa.
-Okay.

00:23:13.158 --> 00:23:14.826 line:95%,end
Can we fill this with beef jerky?

00:23:14.893 --> 00:23:17.562 line:95%,end
Let's get some beef jerky in here
so that it's not empty-looking.

00:23:17.629 --> 00:23:18.530 line:95%,end
MIKE: I think it looks good as is.

00:23:18.597 --> 00:23:20.165 line:95%,end
No, just throw some in.

Hello.

00:23:34.312 --> 00:23:35.781 line:95%,end
From the moment I walk through the door,

00:23:35.847 --> 00:23:38.116 line:95%,end
all I can think is,
what did I get Chloe into?

00:23:38.183 --> 00:23:40.018 line:95%,end
And I really hope I did the right thing.

00:23:40.585 --> 00:23:41.987 line:95%,end
CATHY: I have her costume.

00:23:42.387 --> 00:23:45.123 line:95%,end
Oh, it has beef jerky all over it, Chloe.

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:46.024 line:95%,end
It does.

00:23:46.091 --> 00:23:49.628 line:95%,end
After you're done,
you can eat all of the beef jerky

00:23:49.694 --> 00:23:50.662 line:95%,end
that's on your costume.

00:23:50.729 --> 00:23:51.997 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Oh, good.

00:23:52.063 --> 00:23:54.499 line:95%,end
CATHY: Mike are you watching
so you know when to walk through

00:23:54.566 --> 00:23:56.134 line:95%,end
and sample the jerky?

00:23:56.201 --> 00:23:59.438 line:95%,end
And just go like that and say,
"come and get some," okay?

00:24:00.071 --> 00:24:02.841 line:95%,end
Now how about if you go,
"This ain't my first rodeo."

00:24:03.308 --> 00:24:04.709 line:95%,end
-All right.
-Mike, that's cute.

Hurry up because I'm on a tight schedule.

from Chloe's pay.

00:24:16.855 --> 00:24:17.923 line:95%,end

CATHY: Yeah, you might have
to keep your distance though

00:24:32.404 --> 00:24:33.738 line:95%,end
because you stink a little bit.

00:24:35.106 --> 00:24:35.974 line:95%,end
All right, you're all right?

00:24:36.041 --> 00:24:37.108 line:95%,end
You're fabulous.

00:24:37.175 --> 00:24:38.176 line:95%,end
Kiss, kiss.

00:24:38.243 --> 00:24:39.077 line:95%,end
Let's go.


00:24:42.247 --> 00:24:44.883 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>Welcome back to the countdown</i>

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:46.351 line:95%,end

00:24:46.418 --> 00:24:48.653 line:5%,start
<i>Which dance mom owes me the most money?</i>

00:24:49.287 --> 00:24:51.723 line:5%,start
<i>Come on, that's B, Christi.</i>

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:52.757 line:95%,end
WOMAN: Go.

00:24:52.824 --> 00:24:55.227 line:95%,end
(tense music playing)

00:24:56.728 --> 00:24:57.829 line:95%,end
It came forward.

00:24:57.896 --> 00:24:58.930 line:95%,end
What did you want me to do?

00:24:58.997 --> 00:25:01.399 line:95%,end
You were at the bar having a drink
and her headpiece is falling off.

00:25:01.466 --> 00:25:02.501 line:95%,end
Her headpiece didn't fall off.

00:25:02.567 --> 00:25:03.635 line:95%,end
-It came forward.
-Yes, it did.

00:25:03.702 --> 00:25:04.769 line:95%,end
-Whatever, whatever.
-It didn't fall on the stage.

00:25:04.836 --> 00:25:05.904 line:95%,end
She's fine.

00:25:05.971 --> 00:25:06.938 line:95%,end
She's fine.

00:25:07.005 --> 00:25:08.039 line:95%,end
It's my number, it's my name.

00:25:08.106 --> 00:25:09.007 line:95%,end
It was fine.

00:25:09.074 --> 00:25:10.675 line:95%,end
-ABBY: Okay, just--
-It'll never happen again.

00:25:10.742 --> 00:25:12.577 line:95%,end
-It better not. That's right.
-This conversation is over.

00:25:12.644 --> 00:25:14.312 line:95%,end
-I'm done.
-And you pay your bill late,

00:25:14.379 --> 00:25:15.647 line:95%,end
-by the way.
-CHRISTI: I do not pay my bills late.

00:25:15.714 --> 00:25:17.015 line:95%,end
-Yes, you do. Yes, you do.
-CHRISTI: We'll talk.

00:25:21.386 --> 00:25:25.891 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>The countdown continues</i>

00:25:26.258 --> 00:25:28.093 line:95%,end
What do you think your critique
is going to be?

00:25:28.159 --> 00:25:29.427 line:95%,end
-Better than Kendall?
-Look, look--

00:25:29.494 --> 00:25:30.595 line:95%,end
Better than Kendall?

00:25:30.662 --> 00:25:32.063 line:95%,end
I thought you did better than Kendall too.

00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:33.665 line:95%,end
-PAYTON: Thanks.
-(interposing voices)

00:25:33.732 --> 00:25:35.166 line:95%,end
LESLIE:
I think you'll be getting that sweatsuit.

00:25:35.867 --> 00:25:38.570 line:95%,end
ABBY: Payton, you almost screwed
the whole entire dance up with the sign.

00:25:38.637 --> 00:25:40.071 line:95%,end
You can't just like stick it--

00:25:40.138 --> 00:25:41.239 line:95%,end
LESLIE: Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:25:41.306 --> 00:25:42.207 line:95%,end
No, don't whoa whoa me.

00:25:42.274 --> 00:25:43.742 line:95%,end
-You have to make sure it's on there.
-Melissa is the one that

00:25:43.808 --> 00:25:45.577 line:95%,end
didn't have her daughter's
ponytails up high enough.

00:25:45.644 --> 00:25:46.878 line:95%,end
Why do you got to say Payton did--

00:25:46.945 --> 00:25:48.580 line:95%,end
Well, yeah, but she has to correct
or she's screwed up.

00:25:48.647 --> 00:25:51.116 line:95%,end
No, Abby, it starts
from the beginning and it--

00:25:51.182 --> 00:25:52.350 line:95%,end
Did you just say, "No, Abby?"

00:25:52.417 --> 00:25:54.853 line:95%,end
LESLIE: No, Abby,
I thought she did fabulous.

00:25:55.253 --> 00:25:56.588 line:95%,end
Right, and you're not a dance teacher.

00:25:56.655 --> 00:25:58.089 line:95%,end
LESLIE:
You tell me how you thought she did.

00:25:58.156 --> 00:26:00.725 line:95%,end
I thought she was okay.
I think your turns (indistinct)

00:26:00.792 --> 00:26:02.227 line:95%,end
never crossed your thighs once.

00:26:02.294 --> 00:26:03.461 line:95%,end
You need to fix that turn out.

00:26:03.528 --> 00:26:05.897 line:95%,end
PAYTON: I thought that I was better than
most of the people for all the rounds.

00:26:05.964 --> 00:26:07.566 line:95%,end
ABBY: You thought you were better
than most of the people in this group?

00:26:07.632 --> 00:26:08.466 line:95%,end
PAYTON: Performance-wise.

00:26:10.402 --> 00:26:11.870 line:95%,end
Well, that's cocky.

00:26:11.937 --> 00:26:13.972 line:95%,end
PAYTON: But that's how I feel
performance-wise.

00:26:16.274 --> 00:26:19.411 line:95%,end
-Abby's really mad at Payton.
-WOMAN: Why?

00:26:19.477 --> 00:26:21.146 line:95%,end
Because of the way it came out

00:26:21.212 --> 00:26:24.349 line:95%,end
when Payton was talking about
the rest of the group dance...

00:26:24.416 --> 00:26:25.250 line:95%,end
LESLIE: Right.

00:26:25.317 --> 00:26:26.952 line:95%,end
HOLLY: ...and her performance
in comparison to everyone else.

00:26:27.018 --> 00:26:30.021 line:95%,end
I will speak for myself.
I took it the same way that Abby said it.

00:26:30.088 --> 00:26:33.024 line:95%,end
Wait, wait, and then she apologized
and then you're still saying this to me?

00:26:33.091 --> 00:26:34.659 line:95%,end
Um, you didn't let me finish my comment.

00:26:34.726 --> 00:26:36.661 line:95%,end
Because I'm pissed off, that's why.

00:26:36.728 --> 00:26:38.763 line:95%,end
And you don't accept apologies
from a 14-year-old?

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:39.898 line:95%,end
I did accept her apology.

00:26:39.965 --> 00:26:41.032 line:95%,end
Then don't have this conversation with me.

00:26:41.099 --> 00:26:42.701 line:95%,end
-CHRISTI: But...
-Wait, no, no, no, no, no--

00:26:42.767 --> 00:26:44.402 line:95%,end
...there's a lot of enabling going on.

00:26:44.469 --> 00:26:46.338 line:95%,end
LESLIE: Somebody shut you down
and you can't handle it.

00:26:46.404 --> 00:26:48.073 line:95%,end
-CHRISTI: You aren't shutting me down.
-Yes, I did.

00:26:48.139 --> 00:26:50.742 line:95%,end
Ladies, I'm standing outside

00:26:50.809 --> 00:26:52.277 line:95%,end
with a dance teacher
that's a friend of mine

00:26:52.344 --> 00:26:53.979 line:95%,end
and I can hear every word you're saying.

00:26:54.045 --> 00:26:55.080 line:95%,end
I'm still upset, Abby.

00:26:55.146 --> 00:26:56.548 line:95%,end
I know, but Leslie, you know what?

00:26:56.615 --> 00:26:58.249 line:95%,end
Your daughter is 14 years old.

00:26:58.316 --> 00:27:00.318 line:95%,end
You say that she's a grown up,
she's this, she's that.

00:27:00.385 --> 00:27:01.886 line:95%,end
She has a smart mouth on her.

00:27:01.953 --> 00:27:03.688 line:95%,end
You need to dig
your fingernails into her back...

00:27:03.755 --> 00:27:05.256 line:95%,end
-LESLIE: Wait, wait, wait. Okay, stop.
-...and tell her to shut her mouth.

00:27:05.323 --> 00:27:07.759 line:95%,end
Did you not put her
on the spot that got her

00:27:07.826 --> 00:27:10.395 line:95%,end
to that point where she said
something wrong and apologized to you?

00:27:10.462 --> 00:27:13.898 line:95%,end
You did not put her on this team
because of her comment.

00:27:13.965 --> 00:27:15.333 line:95%,end
Is that--that's what I want to know.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:16.334 line:95%,end
Yes.

00:27:16.401 --> 00:27:17.902 line:95%,end
Then that's a shame. Shame on you.

00:27:17.969 --> 00:27:19.004 line:95%,end
And I hope you feel better...

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:21.439 line:95%,end
-No shame on me.
-...laying her head down on your pillow.

00:27:21.506 --> 00:27:22.440 line:95%,end
Don't shame on me.

00:27:22.507 --> 00:27:23.775 line:95%,end
LESLIE: You're going to kick her off
to the curb?

00:27:23.842 --> 00:27:25.877 line:95%,end
You don't walk into a dressing room
with a whole group of people

00:27:25.944 --> 00:27:28.380 line:95%,end
and say, I was fabulous
and you all weren't.

00:27:28.446 --> 00:27:29.614 line:95%,end
It's ridiculous.

00:27:29.681 --> 00:27:31.282 line:95%,end
LESLIE: No, you picked--you let
a daughter off probation. That's why.

00:27:31.349 --> 00:27:32.717 line:95%,end
You know what Leslie?
You don't need to be here.

00:27:32.784 --> 00:27:35.186 line:95%,end
You said, you can find
a dance to put her in.

00:27:35.253 --> 00:27:36.087 line:95%,end
I did.

00:27:36.154 --> 00:27:38.156 line:95%,end
If Payton wouldn't have been in that,
that would have been Chloe's spot.

00:27:38.223 --> 00:27:39.791 line:95%,end
She came in here

00:27:39.858 --> 00:27:41.960 line:95%,end
and had this snotty little attitude.

00:27:42.027 --> 00:27:43.395 line:95%,end
And you back her up.

00:27:43.962 --> 00:27:46.031 line:95%,end
LESLIE: I don't think you guys
will have to put up with me much longer.

00:27:46.097 --> 00:27:47.332 line:95%,end
I'll be gone. This will be it.

00:27:47.766 --> 00:27:50.402 line:95%,end
Leslie, don't encourage Payton.

00:27:50.468 --> 00:27:53.438 line:95%,end
She doesn't need any encouragement
to speak her mind.

00:27:53.505 --> 00:27:56.207 line:95%,end
She already did it.
And she put her foot right in her mouth.

00:27:57.075 --> 00:27:59.244 line:95%,end
Next time, make sure the foot's pointed.

00:27:59.711 --> 00:28:02.647 line:5%,start
<i>Number five of my OMG moments.</i>

00:28:04.349 --> 00:28:06.985 line:95%,end
Once I put my engagement ring on,
I don't think I ever took it off.

00:28:09.587 --> 00:28:10.989 line:95%,end
Did the girls say anything about it?

00:28:12.757 --> 00:28:13.591 line:95%,end
You don't wear it.

00:28:14.325 --> 00:28:16.027 line:95%,end
-Did they notice it?
-My God.

00:28:18.797 --> 00:28:19.798 line:95%,end
Seriously.

00:28:19.864 --> 00:28:21.866 line:5%,start
I don't know
why the other moms are so nosy.

00:28:21.933 --> 00:28:24.202 line:95%,end
I think sometimes it's jealousy.

00:28:24.803 --> 00:28:25.937 line:95%,end
I'm really not sure.

00:28:26.004 --> 00:28:27.439 line:95%,end
I'm happy in my life.

00:28:27.939 --> 00:28:29.808 line:95%,end
I think they need to worry
about their children

00:28:29.874 --> 00:28:31.609 line:95%,end
and I'll worry about mine.

00:28:31.676 --> 00:28:33.311 line:95%,end
I'm not going this weekend, guys.

00:28:34.646 --> 00:28:36.247 line:95%,end
Abby, I'm sorry to interrupt you,

00:28:36.314 --> 00:28:38.116 line:95%,end
but these people are starting this again.

00:28:38.183 --> 00:28:40.885 line:95%,end
So my kids and I are leaving
and we're not going this weekend.

00:28:40.952 --> 00:28:41.786 line:95%,end
Come on, Maddie.

00:28:41.853 --> 00:28:43.054 line:95%,end
(bleep).

00:28:47.258 --> 00:28:48.093 line:95%,end
Come, kids, we're leaving.

00:28:48.159 --> 00:28:49.260 line:95%,end
We're not coming this weekend.

00:28:49.327 --> 00:28:50.862 line:95%,end
Maddie's crying.

00:28:51.629 --> 00:28:53.565 line:95%,end
Maddie, we're really not going.


00:28:53.631 --> 00:28:54.866 line:95%,end
We're not going.

00:28:54.933 --> 00:28:55.800 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>I knew it.</i>

00:28:55.867 --> 00:29:00.105 line:95%,end
I knew that these other mothers
would eventually push Melissa too far.

00:29:00.171 --> 00:29:01.539 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Abby, tell them.

00:29:01.606 --> 00:29:02.540 line:95%,end
-Tell them now.
-I'm going.

00:29:02.607 --> 00:29:03.641 line:95%,end
I'm going!

00:29:03.708 --> 00:29:05.043 line:95%,end
MELISSA:
Maddie, I know you want to do this.

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:07.112 line:95%,end
-I am not doing this--
-I'm going.

00:29:07.979 --> 00:29:09.414 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Maddie can go without me.

00:29:09.481 --> 00:29:10.515 line:95%,end
If you're going to take care of her...

00:29:10.582 --> 00:29:12.751 line:95%,end
ABBY: I will take care of her.

00:29:12.817 --> 00:29:16.087 line:95%,end
-I will go get your clothes (indistinct)
-ABBY: Come on.

00:29:16.154 --> 00:29:17.522 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Please call your attorney.

00:29:17.589 --> 00:29:20.291 line:95%,end
These (bleep) are doing this again.

00:29:21.993 --> 00:29:22.827 line:95%,end
Thanks, Ab.

00:29:25.497 --> 00:29:26.998 line:95%,end
Melissa is the lady of the group.

00:29:27.065 --> 00:29:29.267 line:95%,end
She's the one I can count on
to be a role model

00:29:29.334 --> 00:29:31.069 line:95%,end
and an example just like Maddie is.

00:29:31.136 --> 00:29:33.371 line:95%,end
And when she starts
using the foul language

00:29:33.438 --> 00:29:35.573 line:95%,end
and she starts upsetting her kids,

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.542 line:95%,end
it's like she was peer pressured into it.

00:29:37.609 --> 00:29:39.477 line:95%,end
Melissa, what are you thinking?

00:29:39.544 --> 00:29:40.545 line:95%,end
You're above those women.

00:29:41.012 --> 00:29:44.516 line:95%,end
<i>And now number four of my OMG moments.</i>

00:29:46.117 --> 00:29:48.419 line:95%,end
-Kelly?
-Yeah?

00:29:48.486 --> 00:29:50.522 line:95%,end
ABBY: I need to know
what's going on with Brooke.

00:29:52.223 --> 00:29:54.092 line:95%,end
You're too high.
Don't pick them up that high.

00:29:54.159 --> 00:29:55.193 line:95%,end
Where is Brooke?

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:57.195 line:95%,end
KELLY: Well, that's what I want
to talk to you about.

00:29:57.262 --> 00:29:59.063 line:95%,end
I don't think she's coming this weekend.

00:30:01.966 --> 00:30:03.401 line:95%,end
We had a long discussion.

00:30:03.468 --> 00:30:05.503 line:95%,end
And there's something
that came up at school

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:06.805 line:95%,end
that she wants to do.

00:30:07.639 --> 00:30:09.407 line:95%,end
And I'm going to allow her to do it.

00:30:10.074 --> 00:30:12.277 line:95%,end
Uh-oh, wait a second. Uh-oh.

00:30:12.343 --> 00:30:13.978 line:95%,end
So she's out?

00:30:14.646 --> 00:30:16.147 line:95%,end
You're making a decision for me

and for everybody in this group.

00:30:17.982 --> 00:30:20.151 line:95%,end
You're letting a 13-year-old kid

00:30:20.218 --> 00:30:23.488 line:95%,end
dictate my future and their future.

00:30:23.555 --> 00:30:25.723 line:95%,end
She should have opened her mouth
and said, Abby,

00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:28.693 line:95%,end
let somebody else be
at the top of the pyramid this week.

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:31.429 line:95%,end
That is a mature 13-year-old,

00:30:31.496 --> 00:30:34.599 line:95%,end
not screwing everybody
and stabbing them in the back.

00:30:34.666 --> 00:30:36.634 line:95%,end
But I don't think
she's screwing any of them.

00:30:36.701 --> 00:30:38.837 line:95%,end
She's screwing me. I can feel it.

00:30:39.771 --> 00:30:41.372 line:95%,end
What are you teaching your child?

00:30:41.439 --> 00:30:43.274 line:95%,end
Are contracts meant to be broken, Kelly?

00:30:43.341 --> 00:30:46.578 line:95%,end
You make a commitment to a group,
you sign a contract.

00:30:46.644 --> 00:30:49.280 line:95%,end
Where is the parent to back this up?

00:30:49.347 --> 00:30:51.082 line:95%,end
Brooke is 13 years old.

00:30:51.149 --> 00:30:52.584 line:95%,end
She's the leader of the group.

00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:55.186 line:95%,end
Why couldn't Brooke open her mouth
and tell me herself?

00:30:55.253 --> 00:30:56.287 line:95%,end
You know why?

00:30:56.354 --> 00:30:58.022 line:95%,end
Because Kelly speaks for them.

00:30:58.089 --> 00:30:59.991 line:95%,end
She sits her kids on her lap,

00:31:00.058 --> 00:31:02.126 line:95%,end
sticks her hand up their butt,
and moves their mouth.

00:31:02.193 --> 00:31:04.128 line:95%,end
You know what Kelly?
You are a cheerleader.

00:31:04.195 --> 00:31:05.897 line:95%,end
Where did it get you?

00:31:05.964 --> 00:31:08.967 line:5%,start
<i>Number three of my OMG moments.</i>

Do you have my bee costume?

00:31:12.937 --> 00:31:14.906 line:95%,end
You mean--hold on--

00:31:14.973 --> 00:31:17.141 line:95%,end
the ugly bee costume that Vivi wore?

00:31:17.208 --> 00:31:19.644 line:95%,end
-Yes, it was her first solo.
-I gave it to the Goodwill.

00:31:22.881 --> 00:31:24.082 line:95%,end
That was $300.

00:31:24.148 --> 00:31:25.149 line:95%,end
Bill me.

00:31:25.216 --> 00:31:26.150 line:95%,end
-CHRISTI: It's a memory.
-WOMAN: It's sentimental.

00:31:26.217 --> 00:31:28.386 line:95%,end
-It's irreplaceable.
-It's sentimental. Her mother...

00:31:28.453 --> 00:31:30.288 line:95%,end
Listen, disco ball,
I'm not talking to you today.

00:31:30.355 --> 00:31:33.258 line:95%,end
This is between Abby and I. So pipe down.

00:31:33.324 --> 00:31:34.292 line:95%,end
-You need--
-Disco ball.

00:31:34.959 --> 00:31:37.929 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>Cathy is just a rude,</i>
<i>mean little woman.</i>

00:31:37.996 --> 00:31:40.531 line:95%,end
She's a nasty, old bat.

00:31:40.598 --> 00:31:42.867 line:95%,end
CATHY: By the way, Christi,
Whoville called

00:31:42.934 --> 00:31:44.102 line:95%,end
and they want your nose back.

00:31:44.168 --> 00:31:46.104 line:95%,end
-Oh, my God, Cathy, listen...
CATHY: Go ahead.

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:48.473 line:95%,end
...when you have a better insult,
something that is--

00:31:48.539 --> 00:31:50.074 line:95%,end
I'm not--I'm not listening to you anymore.

00:31:50.141 --> 00:31:51.843 line:95%,end
When you have a better insult
that's at least--

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:53.311 line:95%,end
CATHY: Please, get out of my face.

00:31:53.378 --> 00:31:54.812 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Oh, no,
I'll get right in your face.

00:31:54.879 --> 00:31:57.949 line:95%,end
-Oh, no, you won't, disco ball.
-Bring it, (bleep).

00:31:58.016 --> 00:32:00.551 line:95%,end
You know something?
That's wonderful that you talk like that

00:32:00.618 --> 00:32:03.588 line:95%,end
in front of your kids, but we don't talk
like that in front of ours.

00:32:03.655 --> 00:32:05.123 line:95%,end
-Do we, moms?
-CHRISTI: I know.

00:32:05.189 --> 00:32:06.591 line:95%,end
-Well, you know what Cathy?
-CATHY: Move along.

00:32:06.658 --> 00:32:08.159 line:95%,end
The dog pound is calling.

00:32:08.226 --> 00:32:10.161 line:95%,end
-Move along.
-Oh, my God, do not put your hands on me.

00:32:10.228 --> 00:32:11.529 line:95%,end
Get out of my face.

00:32:11.596 --> 00:32:14.198 line:95%,end
Your Payless shoes
need to walk out of here.

00:32:14.265 --> 00:32:15.767 line:95%,end
Oh, my God, all you care about is money.

00:32:15.833 --> 00:32:17.302 line:95%,end
-Really had--
-I'm not talking about money.

00:32:17.368 --> 00:32:19.103 line:95%,end
Oh, my God, that's all you talk about.

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:22.140 line:95%,end
You obviously have a complexity issue.

00:32:22.206 --> 00:32:24.309 line:95%,end
I'm talking about style and you have none.

00:32:24.375 --> 00:32:25.743 line:95%,end
-Take your hands off of me.
-CATHY: You know what?

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:27.979 line:95%,end
Take your hands off of me.

00:32:28.046 --> 00:32:31.916 line:95%,end
Cathy wrapped that icy cold
bony little hand around me.

00:32:31.983 --> 00:32:35.153 line:95%,end
It was like the grim reaper
was holding onto my wrist.

00:32:35.219 --> 00:32:36.888 line:95%,end
Move along, disco ball.

00:32:36.955 --> 00:32:38.556 line:95%,end
Oh, my God, you wish.

00:32:38.623 --> 00:32:39.757 line:95%,end
<i>Guess what, Cathy?</i>

00:32:39.824 --> 00:32:41.592 line:95%,end
You can't beat us, so go home.

00:32:41.659 --> 00:32:43.361 line:95%,end
Stop trying. Give up.

00:32:43.428 --> 00:32:46.030 line:95%,end
I have Christi Lu Who

00:32:46.097 --> 00:32:47.699 line:95%,end
talking to the disco ball.

00:32:47.765 --> 00:32:49.701 line:95%,end
I don't know if I'm coming or going.

00:32:49.767 --> 00:32:53.271 line:95%,end
But I do know that these women need to
stop fighting in front of their children.

00:32:53.338 --> 00:32:55.506 line:95%,end
Let's be a little classier, girls.

00:32:55.573 --> 00:32:57.041 line:95%,end
No more fighting.

00:32:57.108 --> 00:32:59.077 line:95%,end
No fighting in front of the kids.

00:32:59.143 --> 00:33:01.779 line:95%,end
Clean up your mouths, next.

<i>Welcome back to the countdown</i>

00:33:06.351 --> 00:33:07.685 line:95%,end

00:33:07.752 --> 00:33:09.754 line:95%,end
<i>What is Kelly's drink of choice?</i>

00:33:09.821 --> 00:33:11.489 line:95%,end
<i>Anything you're pouring.</i>

00:33:11.556 --> 00:33:12.824 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Oh. Cheers.

00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:14.325 line:95%,end

CHRISTI: Wait, can I have another
glass of wine real quick?

ABBY: <i>I cannot believe it.</i>

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:24.235 line:95%,end
<i>These moms are ridiculous.</i>

00:33:24.302 --> 00:33:26.237 line:95%,end
They are in a bar drinking.

00:33:26.304 --> 00:33:28.740 line:95%,end
And their kid
needs to be on stage in 20 minutes.

00:33:28.806 --> 00:33:30.408 line:95%,end
<i>Bad parenting 101.</i>

00:33:30.475 --> 00:33:31.676 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Good Lord.

Hey, what's going on?

00:33:33.111 --> 00:33:34.345 line:95%,end
We're having a cocktail.

00:33:35.446 --> 00:33:36.981 line:95%,end
ABBY: Are you two good to go?

00:33:37.048 --> 00:33:38.483 line:95%,end
-Yeah, we're going to leave in a minute.
-All right.

00:33:40.485 --> 00:33:42.553 line:95%,end
We're double fisted. It's not good.

ABBY: <i>The countdown continues</i>

Where did that costume come from?

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:52.897 line:95%,end
Because it's obviously not pieces
of something you pulled together.

00:33:52.964 --> 00:33:54.499 line:95%,end
-I just wanted you to use pieces..
-This is a costume--

00:33:54.565 --> 00:33:56.300 line:95%,end
...that you had it home
and come up with something

00:33:56.367 --> 00:33:57.301 line:95%,end
at the last minute.

00:33:57.368 --> 00:33:58.836 line:95%,end
This is what I came up with.

00:33:58.903 --> 00:34:00.171 line:95%,end
Well, whose is that, may I ask?

00:34:00.238 --> 00:34:01.572 line:95%,end
This is Kendall's costume.

00:34:01.639 --> 00:34:03.341 line:95%,end
You have not seen her in this costume.

00:34:03.408 --> 00:34:05.510 line:95%,end
-Somebody, somewhere has seen her in it.
-It's Kendall's old costume.

00:34:05.576 --> 00:34:08.346 line:95%,end
It's Kendall's costume now.
It's not one of her old costumes.

00:34:08.413 --> 00:34:10.415 line:95%,end
ABBY: I'm trying to teach
the children a lesson.

00:34:10.481 --> 00:34:12.717 line:95%,end
They don't need a $500 costume to win.

00:34:12.784 --> 00:34:15.019 line:95%,end
You have something at home, make it work.

00:34:15.086 --> 00:34:15.987 line:95%,end
It's not about winning.

00:34:16.054 --> 00:34:17.755 line:95%,end
It's about what I want
to put my daughter in.

00:34:17.822 --> 00:34:20.358 line:95%,end
No, it's about what I want
to put your daughter in.

-Whipped up costume.
-ABBY: Go look at what you have,

00:34:21.826 --> 00:34:23.861 line:95%,end
figure it out, put it on the kid.

00:34:23.928 --> 00:34:26.230 line:95%,end
-That's what I did. That's what I did.

KELLY: Brooke went out there

Because we're following the rules.
You're not.

-ABBY: You're looking at me in the eye.
-This is her costume.

00:34:40.211 --> 00:34:43.081 line:95%,end
Has she ever worn that costume
in the competition on stage

00:34:43.147 --> 00:34:45.750 line:95%,end
or a show or a showcase or a performance

00:34:45.817 --> 00:34:47.518 line:95%,end
or a school gig or anything else?

00:34:47.585 --> 00:34:49.420 line:95%,end
Yes, but you haven't seen her in it.

00:34:49.487 --> 00:34:50.655 line:95%,end
None of you have seen her in it.

00:34:50.721 --> 00:34:52.657 line:95%,end
I don't care.
Somebody else in the world did.

00:34:52.723 --> 00:34:55.026 line:95%,end

-I'm gone. I'm leaving.

00:34:55.093 --> 00:34:57.161 line:95%,end
You don't want me here.
I'll just make it easier for you.

KELLY: No, we want you here.
We want you to play by the rules.

Whatever, whatever.

00:35:00.865 --> 00:35:03.568 line:95%,end
I'll pack my bags and go home right now.

00:35:03.634 --> 00:35:06.304 line:95%,end
Is that--would that make you guys
all really happy?

00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:07.939 line:95%,end
No, that would not make me happy.

00:35:08.005 --> 00:35:09.707 line:95%,end
-Because that's what I'm doing!
-ABBY: And you know who's going to lose?

00:35:09.774 --> 00:35:10.775 line:95%,end
I'm sick of this (bleep).

00:35:10.842 --> 00:35:12.310 line:95%,end
-It's going to be--
-I'm done!

00:35:12.376 --> 00:35:13.811 line:95%,end
I'm going to be your child that loses out.

00:35:13.878 --> 00:35:15.179 line:95%,end

ABBY: It's your daughter.

Jill is throwing shoes. And she's cursing.

00:35:17.014 --> 00:35:20.918 line:95%,end
And all I'm thinking is, you are so hard
to take seriously wearing that hat.

00:35:20.985 --> 00:35:23.321 line:95%,end
Yee-haw, I mean, come on, Jill.

00:35:23.387 --> 00:35:24.455 line:95%,end
What are you thinking?

00:35:24.522 --> 00:35:25.957 line:95%,end
You're not throwing horseshoes.

00:35:26.023 --> 00:35:27.425 line:95%,end
You're throwing jazz shoes.

00:35:27.492 --> 00:35:28.893 line:95%,end
They're not going to hurt anybody.

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:32.296 line:95%,end

you are hurting Kendall.

00:36:38.362 --> 00:36:39.463 line:95%,end
(panting)

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:40.831 line:95%,end
Can I please go again?

00:36:41.499 --> 00:36:43.301 line:95%,end
I've never done this before.

00:36:43.367 --> 00:36:45.069 line:95%,end
I didn't see any tears from you, Abby,

00:36:45.136 --> 00:36:47.104 line:95%,end
when my kid ran off the stage, okay?

00:36:47.171 --> 00:36:48.639 line:95%,end
So point noted.

00:36:48.706 --> 00:36:50.341 line:95%,end
-It's a horrific--
-I don't care. I don't care.

00:36:51.442 --> 00:36:52.977 line:95%,end
I know you don't care.
And that's my point.

00:36:53.044 --> 00:36:54.745 line:95%,end
Come paddle me.
Let's just get it over with quicker.

00:36:54.812 --> 00:36:56.681 line:95%,end
Please, that's a visual
I do not want to see.

00:36:56.747 --> 00:37:00.017 line:95%,end
There was not a tear shed
for another child in this company.

00:37:00.651 --> 00:37:01.786 line:95%,end
That's my issue.

00:37:01.852 --> 00:37:03.154 line:95%,end
These are children.

00:37:03.654 --> 00:37:06.691 line:95%,end
And you just cry for whatever reason
for one child and not the other.

00:37:06.757 --> 00:37:08.826 line:95%,end
-They all hurt the same.
-And the kids know.

00:37:08.893 --> 00:37:10.595 line:95%,end
-The kids know.
-It was so obvious.

00:37:10.661 --> 00:37:14.966 line:95%,end
KELLY: Why don't you care that
all the other kids forgot their dances,

00:37:15.032 --> 00:37:16.300 line:95%,end
but you care for Maddie?

00:37:17.902 --> 00:37:21.205 line:95%,end
(indistinct chatter)

00:37:21.272 --> 00:37:22.807 line:95%,end
Congratulations.

00:37:22.873 --> 00:37:24.175 line:95%,end
CATHY: In all sincerity,

00:37:24.242 --> 00:37:28.145 line:95%,end
we just wanted to congratulate you
on 10th place.

00:37:29.213 --> 00:37:31.949 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Thank you. We're proud
of ourselves, thank you.

00:37:32.016 --> 00:37:34.986 line:95%,end
WOMAN: And congratulations
on one point better.

00:37:35.052 --> 00:37:38.155 line:95%,end
We saw, we came, we kicked (indistinct)

00:37:38.222 --> 00:37:40.324 line:95%,end
-We saw, we came--
-You are Satan!

00:37:40.391 --> 00:37:41.292 line:95%,end
Bye.

00:37:42.159 --> 00:37:45.496 line:95%,end
ABBY: My entire reputation is humiliated.

00:37:52.236 --> 00:37:53.571 line:95%,end
What's going on?

00:37:55.339 --> 00:37:57.608 line:95%,end
-She's going home.
-What do you mean she's going home?

00:37:57.675 --> 00:37:59.143 line:95%,end
She's leaving right now.

00:38:01.746 --> 00:38:03.014 line:95%,end
HOLLY: <i>Did she really leave?</i>

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:04.081 line:95%,end
This can't be real.

00:38:04.148 --> 00:38:05.483 line:95%,end
Where are you going?

00:38:05.549 --> 00:38:07.718 line:95%,end
I'm going to go to the hotel,
get myself, going right to the airport.

00:38:07.785 --> 00:38:09.287 line:95%,end
<i>I need a break.</i>

00:38:09.353 --> 00:38:11.756 line:95%,end
<i>I need a break from these moms,</i>
<i>a break from these kids,</i>

00:38:11.822 --> 00:38:12.857 line:95%,end
a break from the yelling.

00:38:12.923 --> 00:38:14.992 line:95%,end
KELLY: What do you want us
to tell the kids?

00:38:15.059 --> 00:38:16.927 line:95%,end
Your kids are fine.

00:38:16.994 --> 00:38:18.296 line:95%,end
They're great.

00:38:18.362 --> 00:38:22.166 line:95%,end
They have been trained
even as young as seven years old.

00:38:22.233 --> 00:38:23.501 line:5%,start
They know what to do.

00:38:23.567 --> 00:38:24.935 line:5%,start
And they're fine without me.

00:38:25.002 --> 00:38:26.837 line:5%,start
KELLY: <i>I have known Abby for a long time.</i>

00:38:26.904 --> 00:38:29.240 line:5%,start
<i>And I have never seen her like this.</i>

00:38:29.307 --> 00:38:31.142 line:5%,start
I'm shocked.

00:38:32.943 --> 00:38:35.246 line:5%,start
I am appalled at my own behavior.

00:38:35.313 --> 00:38:37.381 line:5%,start
I have let this woman get to me.

00:38:37.448 --> 00:38:39.784 line:5%,start
I mean, who gets excited over ninth place?

00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:42.186 line:5%,start
But those mothers
did push me to the brink.

00:38:42.253 --> 00:38:44.889 line:5%,start
Things were so out of hand
this last dance season.

00:38:44.955 --> 00:38:47.191 line:5%,start
I'm looking forward to a fresh new start.

00:38:47.258 --> 00:38:49.527 line:5%,start
Let the wild behavior begin again.

00:38:49.593 --> 00:38:52.263 line:5%,start
So I'm out of here.
