00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.575 line:5%,start
-Congratulations!
-(cheering)

00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:10.744 line:5%,start
-MELISSA: Your first day.
-My first day.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.746 line:5%,start
Your reputation precedes you.

00:00:12.812 --> 00:00:14.114 line:5%,start
When can Kendall have a solo?

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.915 line:5%,start
You need to tell your mother
to knock it off.

00:00:15.982 --> 00:00:17.183 line:5%,start
She's going to get you in trouble.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.153 line:5%,start
She came in here,
had this snotty little attitude,

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.388 line:5%,start
and you back her up.

00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:22.722 line:5%,start
The dog pound is calling.

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:23.957 line:5%,start
-Move along.
-Oh, my God.

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:25.025 line:5%,start
Do not put your hands on me.

00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:28.194 line:5%,start
-Chloe always being second!
-You--Chloe is not second!

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:30.263 line:5%,start
You'd better not say that, again!

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.832 line:5%,start
WOMAN: <i>Does Abby</i>
<i>and the moms know you came here?</i>

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:33.833 line:5%,start
They have no idea.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.235 line:5%,start
ABBY: You're expelled. You're done.

00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:37.037 line:5%,start
Get the hell out! Go!

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:40.940 line:5%,start
I would never let my child
shake her pom poms

00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:43.043 line:5%,start
for some boy to go to college for free.

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:44.677 line:5%,start
Three and four!

00:00:44.744 --> 00:00:47.147 line:5%,start
ABBY: You're going to be going
to the Joffrey Ballet School.

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:50.950 line:5%,start
MAN: <i>We want to offer Chloe</i>

00:00:51.017 --> 00:00:52.285 line:5%,start
(tense music playing)

00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:54.487 line:5%,start
(groaning)

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:57.257 line:5%,start
We saw! We came!
We kicked apples!

00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:01.327 line:5%,start
My entire reputation
was humiliated.

00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:04.130 line:5%,start
Your kids are fine without me.

00:01:04.197 --> 00:01:05.665 line:5%,start
ABBY: <i>Coming up on </i>Dance Moms...

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:07.167 line:5%,start
The pressure is on you.

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:09.836 line:5%,start
You are representing
my entire career.

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:10.770 line:5%,start
They need to get over it.

00:01:10.837 --> 00:01:12.372 line:5%,start
They've been jealous
since Maddie from day one,

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:13.406 line:5%,start
and it's still are.

00:01:13.473 --> 00:01:16.409 line:5%,start
When you least expect it,
I'm going to throw you out there to do it.

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:18.144 line:5%,start
We wanted you
to say to her why did you lie?

00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:19.512 line:5%,start
Why did you lie to me?

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:21.047 line:5%,start
Posture right there, girls!

00:01:21.114 --> 00:01:22.715 line:5%,start
Don't hunch those shoulders!

00:01:22.782 --> 00:01:25.351 line:5%,start
(tense music playing)

00:01:27.987 --> 00:01:30.957 line:5%,start
I fell and my foot hurts.

00:01:31.024 --> 00:01:33.927 line:5%,start
Do you know you forgot A step?
Don't laugh about it. It's not funny.

Where's Abby?

00:01:54.614 --> 00:01:55.748 line:95%,end
Where is she?

00:01:55.815 --> 00:01:57.383 line:95%,end
I wonder where Abby is.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.220 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: She ditched us in Jersey.
Maybe she didn't come home.

00:02:01.654 --> 00:02:04.657 line:95%,end
<i>Abby's late to pyramid</i>
<i>because she doesn't want to face the moms.</i>

00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:06.893 line:5%,start
Last time she saw us,
she ditched us and our kids.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.595 line:5%,start
And we're going to hold her
accountable for that.

00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:10.763 line:95%,end
Who thanks Miss Abby
is going to apologize

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.099 line:95%,end
-for leaving us stranded?
-Oh, God, no.

00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:14.334 line:95%,end
She never apologizes.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.902 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Honestly, I think
there's only one reason

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.438 line:5%,start
why Abby left the competition
in New Jersey.

00:02:18.505 --> 00:02:20.573 line:5%,start
And that's because
Maddie forgot her dance.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.108 line:95%,end
And it's totally unreasonable.

00:02:22.175 --> 00:02:24.377 line:95%,end
(cheering and applause)

00:02:24.444 --> 00:02:25.979 line:95%,end
(groaning)

00:02:26.045 --> 00:02:27.113 line:95%,end
MADDIE: I want to go again.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.314 line:95%,end
Can I please go again?

00:02:29.382 --> 00:02:30.650 line:95%,end
Maybe she's in the ladies room.

00:02:30.717 --> 00:02:33.486 line:5%,start
We stood there
for probably a good 30 minutes

00:02:33.553 --> 00:02:35.722 line:5%,start
and we were wondering
where Abby was.

00:02:35.788 --> 00:02:37.624 line:95%,end
<i>Because she was nowhere to be found.</i>

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.193 line:95%,end
<i>I need her.</i>
<i>I mean, my kids need her.</i>

00:02:42.795 --> 00:02:44.597 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Does anybody feel
a black cloud approaching?

00:02:44.664 --> 00:02:46.065 line:95%,end
-MELISSA: Yeah.
-What's the weather forecast?

00:02:46.132 --> 00:02:47.367 line:95%,end
(laughs)

00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:52.572 line:95%,end
ABBY: So, I guess it's welcome back.

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:55.975 line:95%,end
New York City didn't turn out
exactly the way I had hoped.

00:02:56.042 --> 00:02:59.412 line:95%,end
ANNOUNCER 1: <i>In 10th place,</i>

<i>Abby Lee Dance Company.</i>

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:04.350 line:95%,end
ANNOUNCER 1: <i>Hey, there.</i>

00:03:05.418 --> 00:03:09.088 line:95%,end
Chloe, congratulations.
You were the winner.

00:03:09.155 --> 00:03:12.492 line:95%,end
ANNOUNCER 2:
<i>Our top Junior Soloist, 891.</i>

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:13.993 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>Yay, Chloe!</i>

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.229 line:95%,end
(cheering and applause)

00:03:16.296 --> 00:03:17.931 line:95%,end
You didn't only win for yourself.

00:03:17.997 --> 00:03:19.732 line:95%,end
You won
for the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.801 line:95%,end
You won for me,
for my name and my reputation,

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:23.570 line:95%,end
-so that was good.
-Thank you.

00:03:24.837 --> 00:03:28.708 line:95%,end
Holly, you were quite upset with me.

00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:30.510 line:95%,end
And I didn't see
any tears from you, Abby,

00:03:30.577 --> 00:03:32.612 line:95%,end
-when my kid ran off the stage.
-I don't care.

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:33.947 line:95%,end
-HOLLY: It's a horrific...
-I don't care.

00:03:34.013 --> 00:03:35.682 line:95%,end
I know you don't care,
and that's my point.

00:03:35.748 --> 00:03:37.984 line:95%,end
I think you assumed
that I was upset

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:41.521 line:95%,end
because Maddie ran off the stage,
and you're absolutely right.

00:03:41.588 --> 00:03:42.956 line:95%,end
And that's why I left.

00:03:43.022 --> 00:03:46.893 line:5%,start
After Maddie forgetting her dance,
I was at my wit's end.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.330 line:95%,end
HOLLY: As a coach, as their teacher,
they all deserve a hug.

00:03:50.396 --> 00:03:52.365 line:95%,end
Nia had you!

00:03:52.432 --> 00:03:54.934 line:95%,end
She went to you
when she forgot her dance.

00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:57.737 line:95%,end
Why don't you be the adult and the leader
and console them first?

00:03:57.804 --> 00:04:00.306 line:95%,end
KELLY: You yelled at Paige
and told her she was stupid.


00:04:00.373 --> 00:04:02.742 line:95%,end
And when Maddie does it,
oh, you forgive her and it's okay.

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:04.010 line:95%,end
It's not her fault.

00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:07.614 line:95%,end
I think the case in point is,
is we know that you don't care.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.616 line:95%,end
Some kids are just special!

00:04:09.682 --> 00:04:11.618 line:95%,end
<i>I did not abandon the team.</i>

00:04:11.684 --> 00:04:14.187 line:95%,end
Nobody pays me
to go to a competition.

00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:17.757 line:95%,end
<i>I am going there</i>
<i>to be the dance teacher,</i>

00:04:17.824 --> 00:04:20.360 line:95%,end
not to sit in a room
and babysit their children.

00:04:20.426 --> 00:04:22.729 line:95%,end
Enough.
My time is very valuable.

00:04:22.795 --> 00:04:25.098 line:95%,end
I did not call you in here
to discuss this.

00:04:25.164 --> 00:04:26.833 line:95%,end
We're talking about this week.

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:31.371 line:95%,end
You are going
to NexStar Competition in LA.

00:04:31.437 --> 00:04:33.940 line:95%,end
And those little kids in LA
are good, and you all know that.

00:04:34.007 --> 00:04:38.444 line:95%,end
In California,
the kids just are fearless.

00:04:38.511 --> 00:04:41.547 line:95%,end
<i>They know they need to be forthcoming</i>
<i>with their emotions.</i>

00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:42.582 line:95%,end
<i>Our kids don't do that.</i>

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:45.685 line:95%,end
It takes a lot
to draw that personality out of a kid.

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:48.588 line:95%,end
So let's start with the pyramid.

00:04:48.655 --> 00:04:52.925 line:95%,end
Paige, the one thing we talked about

00:04:52.992 --> 00:04:54.661 line:95%,end
as soon as we got the props...

00:04:54.727 --> 00:04:57.196 line:95%,end
<i>you have to handle that prop.</i>
<i>You're responsible for that prop.</i>

00:04:57.263 --> 00:04:58.731 line:95%,end
<i>You can't let it</i>
<i>get away from you.</i>

00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:00.667 line:95%,end
As soon as you started
the competition,

00:05:00.733 --> 00:05:02.335 line:95%,end
the prop went right away from you.

00:05:03.503 --> 00:05:08.174 line:95%,end
Nia, when we were rehearsing
the number you wore a biketard.

00:05:08.241 --> 00:05:11.210 line:95%,end
And the entire rehearsal,

00:05:11.277 --> 00:05:13.479 line:95%,end
you pulled at that and pulled at that
and pulled at that.

00:05:13.546 --> 00:05:15.448 line:95%,end
You can't concentrate
on what you're doing.

00:05:16.616 --> 00:05:18.885 line:95%,end
Brooke, we get to the Joffrey.

00:05:18.951 --> 00:05:21.220 line:95%,end
Everybody else runs in
with their pointe shoes on

00:05:21.287 --> 00:05:23.356 line:95%,end
and you're not going to do pointe.

00:05:23.423 --> 00:05:26.559 line:95%,end
So they're looking at that
as if, wait a minute,

00:05:26.626 --> 00:05:29.462 line:95%,end
her ankles should be strong enough
to go on pointe.

00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:32.965 line:95%,end
Next we have Maddie.

00:05:33.032 --> 00:05:35.101 line:95%,end
Should you be
at the bottom of the pyramid

00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:36.235 line:95%,end
because you ran off the stage?

00:05:36.302 --> 00:05:37.303 line:95%,end
Yes, you should.

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.806 line:95%,end
You're the responsible one
that everybody counts on.

00:05:39.872 --> 00:05:41.007 line:95%,end
That's why you're here.

00:05:41.074 --> 00:05:43.142 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>When Chloe,</i>
<i>Nia and Paige forgot their dance,</i>

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:44.811 line:95%,end
<i>they were at the bottom</i>
<i>of the pyramid.</i>

00:05:44.877 --> 00:05:46.879 line:95%,end
I think that Maddie
is in the middle of the pyramid

00:05:46.946 --> 00:05:49.749 line:95%,end
because, again, it goes back
to Abby playing favorites.

00:05:49.816 --> 00:05:52.085 line:95%,end
Next I have Mackenzie.

00:05:52.151 --> 00:05:54.420 line:95%,end
Mackenzie,
you should be proud of yourself

00:05:54.487 --> 00:05:55.722 line:95%,end
that you're this high on the pyramid.

00:05:55.788 --> 00:05:59.258 line:95%,end
It's your charisma,
it's your face

00:05:59.325 --> 00:06:01.694 line:95%,end
that are moving the audience.

00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:04.697 line:5%,start
MACKENZIE: I'm excited
that I'm moving up at the pyramid.

00:06:04.764 --> 00:06:07.834 line:95%,end
And, Chloe, congratulations.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.635 line:95%,end
You're on top of the pyramid.

00:06:09.702 --> 00:06:11.771 line:95%,end
You're going to be featured
in the group number.

00:06:11.838 --> 00:06:14.907 line:95%,end
We have Chloe doing a solo.

00:06:14.974 --> 00:06:18.978 line:95%,end
We also have a solo
with Mackenzie.

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:21.214 line:95%,end
And I entered a solo for Maddie,

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.715 line:95%,end
but I'm not going to have her do it.

00:06:22.782 --> 00:06:24.617 line:95%,end
She needs to get her head on straight.

00:06:24.684 --> 00:06:27.320 line:95%,end
I've noticed
some subtle changes in Maddie.

00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:30.690 line:95%,end
<i>She's humbled,</i>
<i>certainly, from her experience.</i>

00:06:30.757 --> 00:06:32.859 line:95%,end
I think she'll bounce back in time.

00:06:34.694 --> 00:06:38.998 line:95%,end
And my trio is going to be Chloe,
Brooke, Paige.

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:42.068 line:95%,end
And I need you
to be on fire on that stage.

00:06:42.135 --> 00:06:45.171 line:95%,end
The group number
is called "I Want it Now."

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:46.539 line:95%,end
Can I hear you all say that?

00:06:46.606 --> 00:06:49.709 line:95%,end
I want it now!

00:06:49.776 --> 00:06:53.246 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>The group number four this week</i>
<i>is called "I Want it Now."</i>

00:06:53.312 --> 00:06:57.984 line:95%,end
It's, like, the epitome
of the rich little brat saying,

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:00.153 line:95%,end
"I want that, I want that,
I want this, I want that."

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:01.788 line:95%,end
That's what we're going for.

00:07:01.854 --> 00:07:03.022 line:95%,end
Pressure is on.

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:04.724 line:95%,end
When we get to that competition

00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:08.561 line:95%,end
and you walk into that auditorium,
you are up here.

00:07:08.628 --> 00:07:09.495 line:95%,end
Do you understand?

00:07:09.562 --> 00:07:11.063 line:95%,end
Yes?
Moms, thank you very much.

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:12.231 line:95%,end
You're dismissed.

00:07:12.298 --> 00:07:13.266 line:95%,end
Girls, let's go.

00:07:13.332 --> 00:07:16.402 line:95%,end
<i>The dancers at this competition</i>
<i>are going to be fierce.</i>

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:18.738 line:95%,end
I need my girls to bring their A game.

00:07:18.805 --> 00:07:20.807 line:95%,end
<i>I need the mothers</i>
<i>to stop questioning my integrity.</i>

00:07:20.873 --> 00:07:21.808 line:95%,end
I mean, come on.

00:07:21.874 --> 00:07:24.210 line:95%,end
The Abby Lee Dance Company
is my life's work.

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:25.645 line:5%,start
I need to see that again.

00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:29.715 line:95%,end
I just want her to do her job.

00:07:29.782 --> 00:07:31.617 line:95%,end
That means
when you go to a competition,

00:07:31.684 --> 00:07:33.753 line:95%,end
you sit yourself there
until the competition is over.

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.321 line:95%,end
-That's part of our fee.
-That is.

00:07:35.388 --> 00:07:38.391 line:95%,end
And shoulder, shoulder--
while you're sitting there, da, da,

00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:39.425 line:95%,end
to the beat, to the beat.

00:07:39.492 --> 00:07:40.593 line:95%,end
She acted like an (bleep).

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.328 line:95%,end
ABBY: I gave you a pose here.

00:07:42.395 --> 00:07:43.896 line:95%,end
I gave you a pose.

00:07:43.963 --> 00:07:45.364 line:95%,end
That was pretty depressing down there.

00:07:45.431 --> 00:07:47.300 line:95%,end
-I was pretty irritated.
-CHRISTI: She's--she's a--

00:07:47.366 --> 00:07:48.968 line:95%,end
she's a despicable person.

00:07:49.035 --> 00:07:53.005 line:95%,end
We know exactly what happened,
and she just changed the truth.

00:07:53.072 --> 00:07:54.907 line:95%,end
Arms, Chloe!

00:07:54.974 --> 00:07:58.444 line:95%,end
<i>You know, I'm a little nervous</i>
<i>about Chloe leading this team to victory.</i>

00:07:58.511 --> 00:08:00.980 line:95%,end
<i>NexStar is one tough competition.</i>


00:08:01.047 --> 00:08:03.349 line:95%,end
I just wish Maddie
was ready to go

00:08:03.416 --> 00:08:04.884 line:95%,end
and had her head
back in the game.

00:08:04.951 --> 00:08:06.118 line:95%,end
Every time something goes wrong,

00:08:06.185 --> 00:08:07.987 line:95%,end
what, is she going to get up and leave?

00:08:08.054 --> 00:08:09.188 line:95%,end
I don't think she would, but...

00:08:09.255 --> 00:08:11.324 line:95%,end
KELLY: I think that we need
to make it known to her

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:12.725 line:95%,end
that, you know what,
if you want to leave again,

00:08:12.792 --> 00:08:13.659 line:95%,end
-go ahead and leave.
-CHRISTI: Go ahead.

00:08:13.726 --> 00:08:14.627 line:95%,end
We're fine.
-We don't need you.

00:08:14.694 --> 00:08:16.028 line:95%,end
How do you feel about it, Melissa?

00:08:16.095 --> 00:08:17.864 line:95%,end
Well, she lied to me so I was--

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:20.132 line:95%,end
I mean, I'm just upset because of that.

00:08:20.199 --> 00:08:22.034 line:95%,end
She told me
she was going home to her mom,

00:08:22.101 --> 00:08:24.303 line:95%,end
so I called her a car.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:26.339 line:95%,end
<i>She told me the reason she left the team</i>
<i>in New Jersey</i>

00:08:26.405 --> 00:08:28.708 line:95%,end
<i>was because her mom is really ill.</i>

00:08:28.774 --> 00:08:33.479 line:95%,end
So I believed that she was going home
to see her mom.

00:08:33.546 --> 00:08:37.383 line:95%,end
<i>But she was really embarrassed</i>
<i>with Maddie forgetting her solo.</i>

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:39.285 line:95%,end
ABBY: Posture when you roll!

00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:41.153 line:95%,end
Arms are behind you!

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:42.688 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>So now the truth is out.</i>

00:08:42.755 --> 00:08:44.857 line:5%,start
Melissa knew that Abby
was going to leave the competition.

00:08:44.924 --> 00:08:46.025 line:5%,start
She even helped her.

00:08:46.092 --> 00:08:47.159 line:95%,end
She called the cab!

00:08:47.226 --> 00:08:51.163 line:95%,end
But did you say anything to her,
like, "Abby why did you do that to me?

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:53.199 line:95%,end
-You made me look like an idiot."
-Nope.

00:08:53.266 --> 00:08:55.101 line:95%,end
Well, I could think of
is if Abby is supposed

00:08:55.167 --> 00:08:58.671 line:95%,end
to be your friend, Melissa,
that was not a very friendly thing to do.

00:08:58.738 --> 00:09:00.306 line:95%,end
A friend doesn't do that a friend.

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:01.908 line:95%,end
-CHRISTI: But you won't play ball.
-You in go in say something

00:09:01.974 --> 00:09:03.576 line:95%,end
because you're the one she lied to.

00:09:03.643 --> 00:09:05.611 line:95%,end
It should be you
because you're the one who she lied to.

00:09:05.678 --> 00:09:06.913 line:95%,end
-So it should be you...
-KELLY: And you're the one

00:09:06.979 --> 00:09:08.147 line:95%,end
that called the cab for her to leave.

00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:09.115 line:95%,end
...having the confrontation
with her, not us.

00:09:09.181 --> 00:09:10.283 line:95%,end
KELLY: And it was your daughter
that she wanted...

00:09:10.349 --> 00:09:12.952 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I feel that Christi and Kelly
can care less

00:09:13.019 --> 00:09:14.453 line:95%,end
if I was mistreated by Abby.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.689 line:95%,end
They just want to cause
trouble and drama.

00:09:16.756 --> 00:09:20.526 line:95%,end
Let's look at the bright side.

00:09:20.593 --> 00:09:22.261 line:95%,end
We're going to LA.

00:09:22.328 --> 00:09:24.497 line:95%,end
I'm just glad
Cathy's not going to be there

00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:25.698 line:95%,end
because she really annoys me.

00:09:25.765 --> 00:09:28.100 line:95%,end
She's so--she's very obnoxious
in the audience.

00:09:28.167 --> 00:09:31.370 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I've never seen someone
so happy about ninth place, in my life.

00:09:31.437 --> 00:09:32.872 line:95%,end
-Woo!
-KELLY: I know.

00:09:32.939 --> 00:09:36.208 line:95%,end
-Woo!
-(laughter)

00:09:36.275 --> 00:09:38.110 line:95%,end
(quirky music playing)

00:09:38.177 --> 00:09:41.647 line:95%,end
INSTRUCTOR: One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.

00:09:41.714 --> 00:09:43.883 line:95%,end
CATHY: <i>We came in full force,</i>

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:46.118 line:5%,start
and we beat
the Abby Lee dancers.

00:09:46.185 --> 00:09:50.590 line:95%,end
<i>I think my team</i>
<i>totally upstaged Abby's dancers.</i>

00:09:50.656 --> 00:09:52.258 line:95%,end
I'm on top of the world right now.

00:09:52.325 --> 00:09:56.028 line:95%,end
Okay, so I called you guys in here
because I got the best news today.

00:09:56.095 --> 00:10:00.366 line:95%,end
<i>Taylor's mom and dad</i>
<i>told me that the doctor has released her.</i>

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:02.835 line:95%,end
(cheering)

00:10:02.902 --> 00:10:05.605 line:95%,end
So that means
that she's back competing with us.

00:10:05.671 --> 00:10:09.375 line:95%,end
Oh, Taylor, apple of my eye,

00:10:09.442 --> 00:10:11.243 line:95%,end
girlfriend,
you don't need those crutches.

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:14.413 line:95%,end
Welcome back, Taylor!

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.048 line:95%,end
CATHY: Come here.
Look at the cake.

00:10:16.115 --> 00:10:17.583 line:95%,end
Is that awesome or what?

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:19.652 line:95%,end
Taylor, we are so glad that you are back.

00:10:19.719 --> 00:10:21.253 line:95%,end
You just can't imagine!

00:10:22.388 --> 00:10:24.090 line:95%,end
I'm so happy
that you can dance, again.

00:10:24.156 --> 00:10:26.292 line:95%,end
I don't ever want
to see this thing, again.

00:10:26.359 --> 00:10:28.794 line:95%,end
We are given the boot the boot.

00:10:28.861 --> 00:10:30.429 line:95%,end
(applause)

00:10:32.398 --> 00:10:35.234 line:95%,end
We have been rehearsing
like maniacs.

00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:38.371 line:95%,end
And we intend to beat
the Abby Lee dancers again,

00:10:38.437 --> 00:10:39.839 line:95%,end
<i>and again, and again.</i>

00:10:39.905 --> 00:10:42.408 line:95%,end
Cheers!

(upbeat music playing)

00:10:43.876 --> 00:10:46.112 line:5%,start
ABBY: You need to look
all the way to that center judge,

00:10:46.178 --> 00:10:47.079 line:95%,end
and you're not.

00:10:47.146 --> 00:10:49.448 line:95%,end
You stopped your vision
right there at Gianna, and quit.

00:10:49.515 --> 00:10:50.950 line:95%,end
All right,
let's go again from the top.

00:10:51.017 --> 00:10:53.853 line:5%,start
(slow music playing)

00:10:53.919 --> 00:10:56.922 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>Chloe's dance</i>

00:10:56.989 --> 00:10:59.592 line:95%,end
<i>She's wearing a red</i>
<i>two-piece costume.</i>

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:01.193 line:95%,end
It's just a hot number.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:02.294 line:95%,end
She's on fire.

00:11:02.361 --> 00:11:04.096 line:95%,end
It's lyrical contemporary.

00:11:04.163 --> 00:11:06.032 line:95%,end
<i>It's a nice number for her.</i>

00:11:06.098 --> 00:11:07.967 line:95%,end
<i>The song is good, it's short.</i>

00:11:08.034 --> 00:11:09.735 line:95%,end
Let's hope she doesn't forget it.

00:11:09.802 --> 00:11:11.504 line:95%,end
I'll tell you, you've been on the top
of the pyramid before

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:12.705 line:95%,end
but you haven't stayed there.

00:11:12.772 --> 00:11:14.874 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>There is so much pressure</i>
<i>on Chloe this week.</i>

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:17.410 line:95%,end
You know,
Abby's mantra is it's easy to get

00:11:17.476 --> 00:11:19.578 line:95%,end
to the top of the pyramid,
it's hard to stay there.

00:11:19.645 --> 00:11:21.881 line:95%,end
So, of course,
she wants her to fail.

00:11:21.947 --> 00:11:23.349 line:95%,end
If you want to be
a professional dancer,

00:11:23.416 --> 00:11:25.351 line:95%,end
you can't go out on stage
and forget the dance.

00:11:25.418 --> 00:11:27.386 line:95%,end
It doesn't work that way.
You got lucky, kid.

00:11:27.453 --> 00:11:30.690 line:95%,end
I've been on Chloe this week
because she has a lot on her plate.

00:12:58.677 --> 00:13:00.679 line:95%,end
Do that left assemble
and do that left stag

00:13:00.746 --> 00:13:03.449 line:95%,end
and get up and touch your head,
you little lazy butt.

00:13:03.516 --> 00:13:04.850 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:13:04.917 --> 00:13:06.418 line:95%,end
ABBY: There you go.
That was beautiful.

00:13:06.485 --> 00:13:07.920 line:95%,end
Take in every judge.

00:13:07.987 --> 00:13:09.021 line:95%,end
Hi, over there.

00:13:09.088 --> 00:13:10.289 line:95%,end
Even though
the one in front of you--

00:13:10.356 --> 00:13:12.358 line:95%,end
look at these people, too.

00:13:12.424 --> 00:13:13.793 line:5%,start
I feel Mackenzie has matured.

00:13:13.859 --> 00:13:15.461 line:95%,end
I'm fabulous.

00:13:15.528 --> 00:13:17.530 line:95%,end
Look at me. Now go.

00:13:18.531 --> 00:13:20.032 line:95%,end
SINGER: <i>âª</i><i>Yeah, yeah</i><i>âª</i>

00:13:20.099 --> 00:13:22.601 line:95%,end
<i>âª</i><i>Search high and low but just...</i><i>âª</i>

00:13:22.668 --> 00:13:23.836 line:95%,end
Keep going.

00:13:23.903 --> 00:13:25.271 line:95%,end
Smile.
Don't look at the floor.

00:13:25.337 --> 00:13:28.941 line:95%,end
She just loves this number,
and that's half the battle.

00:13:29.008 --> 00:13:30.976 line:95%,end
That has to be...

00:13:31.043 --> 00:13:32.845 line:95%,end
Come on.
Let me see some sass.

00:13:32.912 --> 00:13:34.280 line:95%,end
<i>She's excited about it.</i>

00:13:34.346 --> 00:13:38.551 line:95%,end
She loves the difficulty of it,
and she loves the prop.

00:13:38.617 --> 00:13:40.953 line:95%,end
Yay!

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:43.489 line:95%,end
You remembered it all!

00:13:43.556 --> 00:13:46.025 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:13:48.527 --> 00:13:51.430 line:5%,start
ABBY: Let's spread apart.
Let's warm up a little bit.

00:13:51.497 --> 00:13:53.399 line:5%,start
<i>This week Chloe is the leader</i>
<i>of the routine.</i>

00:13:53.465 --> 00:13:55.401 line:95%,end
<i>Can she handle it?</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

00:13:55.467 --> 00:13:57.770 line:95%,end
She's used to looking at Maddie
on the corner of her eye

00:13:57.837 --> 00:13:59.104 line:95%,end
<i>to see what to do next.</i>

00:13:59.171 --> 00:14:00.739 line:95%,end
Girls, get on the floor.

00:14:00.806 --> 00:14:02.741 line:95%,end
Start to roll, just Nia.

00:14:02.808 --> 00:14:04.143 line:95%,end
Okay, good.

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:06.979 line:95%,end
Turn--no, no, no.
Turn this way.

00:14:07.046 --> 00:14:09.248 line:95%,end
<i>If Chloe wants to stay</i>
<i>on top of that pyramid,</i>

00:14:09.315 --> 00:14:10.616 line:95%,end
this is how
I'm going to train her.

00:14:10.683 --> 00:14:13.485 line:95%,end
Boom! Chloe, you're up tall. Big.

00:14:13.552 --> 00:14:15.321 line:95%,end
This has to be all about you.

00:14:16.522 --> 00:14:18.157 line:95%,end
Let's go.

00:14:18.224 --> 00:14:21.360 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Our conversation yesterday
at the front desk

00:14:21.427 --> 00:14:23.596 line:95%,end
kind of threw me for a loop, Melissa.

00:14:23.662 --> 00:14:25.097 line:95%,end
I got to just put it out there.

00:14:25.164 --> 00:14:27.933 line:95%,end
I Thought we were going downstairs,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.902 line:95%,end
if memory serves me correctly,
that we were going to have your back

00:14:29.969 --> 00:14:31.704 line:95%,end
and you were
going to introduce the topic.

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:34.039 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I said to Abby
that everybody's been on my case

00:14:34.106 --> 00:14:35.174 line:95%,end
all the time.

00:14:35.241 --> 00:14:36.242 line:95%,end
It's all about Maddie,
Maddie, Maddie,

00:14:36.308 --> 00:14:37.509 line:95%,end
Maddie, Maddie, Maddie, Maddie.


00:14:37.576 --> 00:14:39.778 line:95%,end
The real reason
she brought me into the bathroom,

00:14:39.845 --> 00:14:42.448 line:95%,end
she told me,
"I need to go home to my mother."

00:14:42.514 --> 00:14:43.549 line:95%,end
And I believed her. And she...

00:14:43.616 --> 00:14:45.017 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Fine.
But you sat up here and said

00:14:45.084 --> 00:14:46.685 line:95%,end
that you were mad that she lied to you.

00:14:46.752 --> 00:14:48.287 line:95%,end
So we said,
go tell her that you're upset.

00:14:48.354 --> 00:14:50.322 line:95%,end
We wanted you to say to her,
why did you lie?

00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:51.590 line:95%,end
Why did you lie to me?

00:14:51.657 --> 00:14:52.925 line:95%,end
CHRISTI:
You have to step up to the plate.

00:14:52.992 --> 00:14:53.959 line:95%,end
I know. I know. I know.

00:14:54.026 --> 00:14:56.829 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: And that was a perfect
opportunity for you to do it,

00:14:56.896 --> 00:14:58.631 line:95%,end
and you threw us under the bus.

00:14:58.697 --> 00:15:01.333 line:95%,end
-It's so hard for me. I don't know.
-It's hard for all of us!

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.369 line:95%,end
<i>Melissa always says</i>
<i>that we're so mean to her,</i>

00:15:03.435 --> 00:15:04.970 line:95%,end
<i>that we never take her side.</i>

00:15:05.037 --> 00:15:06.505 line:5%,start
But she lied to us, again.

00:15:06.572 --> 00:15:10.042 line:5%,start
So how can I trust somebody
who constantly lies?

00:15:10.109 --> 00:15:11.443 line:95%,end
I'm a nervous wreck
when it comes to confrontation.

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:12.478 line:95%,end
KELLY:
But you sat up here and said--

00:15:12.544 --> 00:15:14.580 line:95%,end
but you're still not sticking up
for yourself. And...

00:15:14.647 --> 00:15:16.649 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I know. I never do.
I'm a doormat!

00:15:19.351 --> 00:15:22.354 line:5%,start
(upbeat music playing)

00:15:23.856 --> 00:15:25.925 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>Brooke, Chloe and Paige</i>
<i>are doing a trio,</i>

00:15:25.991 --> 00:15:27.559 line:95%,end
<i>and it's called</i>
<i>"Girls in the House."</i>

00:15:27.626 --> 00:15:30.496 line:5%,start
I definitely think
this is going to be a challenging trio

00:15:30.562 --> 00:15:32.197 line:95%,end
<i>because we have three girls</i>

00:15:32.264 --> 00:15:34.066 line:95%,end
that dance three different styles.

00:15:34.133 --> 00:15:36.168 line:95%,end
ABBY: Okay.
Step out on your left foot

00:15:36.235 --> 00:15:37.836 line:95%,end
and, like, take your arms
and brush them back

00:15:37.903 --> 00:15:39.305 line:95%,end
and stick your rear end out like this.

00:15:39.371 --> 00:15:40.539 line:95%,end
Boom.

00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:42.141 line:95%,end
Ba, ball change.

00:15:42.207 --> 00:15:44.109 line:95%,end
Five, six--ready, right here?

00:15:44.176 --> 00:15:46.245 line:95%,end
Five--Maddie,
can you demonstrate for me?

00:15:46.312 --> 00:15:48.847 line:95%,end
(tense music playing)

00:15:49.848 --> 00:15:52.551 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I'm a little confused
why the swing, Maddie,

00:15:52.618 --> 00:15:55.321 line:95%,end
is now demonstrating
how the trio's properly done

00:15:55.387 --> 00:15:57.122 line:95%,end
<i>to the girls in the trio.</i>

00:15:57.189 --> 00:15:59.692 line:95%,end
<i>Is that just another way</i>
<i>for Abby to rub it in their face,</i>

00:15:59.758 --> 00:16:02.695 line:95%,end
that she feels that Maddie
is the best dancer in the group?

00:16:02.761 --> 00:16:06.265 line:95%,end
Maddie, count Chloe's section
and make sure

00:16:06.332 --> 00:16:07.566 line:95%,end
you give me the right counts.

00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:10.869 line:95%,end
Chloe has to realize,
this is how hard I push Maddie.

00:16:10.936 --> 00:16:14.340 line:95%,end
This is how I train girls
to get to the top of that pyramid.

00:16:14.406 --> 00:16:15.841 line:95%,end
Squat and touch the floor.

00:16:17.409 --> 00:16:19.345 line:95%,end
Squat and touch the floor.

00:16:19.411 --> 00:16:21.046 line:95%,end
Your feet should be together.

00:16:21.113 --> 00:16:23.248 line:95%,end
Maddie, watch Chloe
to make sure she's doing her part,

00:16:23.315 --> 00:16:24.616 line:95%,end
because I keep looking at Paige.

00:16:24.683 --> 00:16:27.953 line:95%,end
MADDIE: <i>It was really hard watching Chloe</i>
<i>be on the top of the pyramid.</i>

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:30.522 line:5%,start
I'm really happy
for Chloe, but it just, like,

00:16:30.589 --> 00:16:32.958 line:5%,start
feels weird to me
because I don't have a solo.

00:16:33.025 --> 00:16:34.827 line:95%,end
Brooke, you have to walk
right around yourself

00:16:34.893 --> 00:16:36.028 line:95%,end
and be in the front.

00:16:37.696 --> 00:16:39.565 line:95%,end
Paige, you're too far away
from the other two!

00:16:39.631 --> 00:16:41.066 line:95%,end
Move over, Paige!

00:16:42.167 --> 00:16:44.169 line:95%,end
KELLY: I don't understand
our choreography lately.

00:16:44.236 --> 00:16:45.237 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Mm-mm.

00:16:45.304 --> 00:16:48.173 line:95%,end
It just seems so stupid.

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:49.842 line:95%,end
HOLLY: It's not impressive.

00:16:49.908 --> 00:16:51.176 line:95%,end
ABBY: Walk!

00:16:51.243 --> 00:16:52.745 line:95%,end
KELLY: I mean,
we do a lot of posing,

00:16:52.811 --> 00:16:56.148 line:95%,end
a lot of walking around.

00:16:56.215 --> 00:16:58.984 line:95%,end
And, you know, like,
where's the technique?

00:16:59.051 --> 00:17:01.353 line:95%,end
Get in that releve!

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:02.755 line:95%,end
(thump)

00:17:02.821 --> 00:17:03.655 line:95%,end
KELLY: I hate that.

00:17:03.722 --> 00:17:04.757 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I do, too.

00:17:04.823 --> 00:17:06.325 line:95%,end
They're going
to break their knees.

00:17:06.392 --> 00:17:09.161 line:95%,end
ABBY: No judge wants to see you
bang your knee on the floor.

00:17:09.228 --> 00:17:10.729 line:95%,end
Ready, girls? Go.


00:17:13.665 --> 00:17:16.602 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:17:20.239 --> 00:17:22.341 line:95%,end
ABBY: Girls,
we need three judges, please.

00:17:22.408 --> 00:17:24.243 line:5%,start
I've asked Paige,
Nia and Maddie

00:17:24.309 --> 00:17:27.546 line:5%,start
to just sit down for a minute
and critique Chloe's solo

00:17:27.613 --> 00:17:29.214 line:95%,end
as she does it.

00:17:29.281 --> 00:17:32.785 line:95%,end
You know, a good dancer
gets better by watching others.

00:17:32.851 --> 00:17:35.454 line:5%,start
(slow music playing)

00:17:38.323 --> 00:17:40.059 line:95%,end
MELISSA: <i>Usually,</i>
<i>Maddie has a lot of pressure on her</i>

00:17:40.125 --> 00:17:43.162 line:95%,end
<i>with a trio,</i>
<i>a group dance, and a solo.</i>

00:17:43.228 --> 00:17:45.731 line:5%,start
I'm so glad she only has to worry
about the group dance this week.

00:17:45.798 --> 00:17:48.100 line:5%,start
That just means
more added pressure to Chloe.

00:17:48.167 --> 00:17:51.904 line:95%,end
<i>âª</i><i>I'll keep on burning</i><i>âª</i>

00:17:54.006 --> 00:17:55.974 line:95%,end
<i>âª</i><i>I'll keep on burning</i><i>âª</i>

00:17:56.041 --> 00:17:58.277 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>I don't know</i>
<i>where Abby comes up with these ideas.</i>

00:17:58.343 --> 00:18:00.712 line:5%,start
We try to teach our kids
to be supportive of each other,

00:18:00.779 --> 00:18:02.047 line:5%,start
not judgmental.

00:18:02.114 --> 00:18:04.650 line:95%,end
So you're putting everyone
in an awkward position.

00:18:07.619 --> 00:18:09.188 line:95%,end
ABBY: Okay, comments.

00:18:09.254 --> 00:18:10.722 line:95%,end
PAIGE: I thought it was good.

00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:13.125 line:95%,end
But my correction
was whenever she flexed her foot...

00:18:13.192 --> 00:18:14.326 line:95%,end
ABBY: Okay. I saw that.

00:18:14.393 --> 00:18:16.495 line:95%,end
Go ahead,
tell her what she was doing wrong.

00:18:16.562 --> 00:18:19.231 line:5%,start
NIA: I didn't really like judging Chloe
because she's our friend.

00:18:19.298 --> 00:18:22.000 line:5%,start
And if my friends
were judging my dance,

00:18:22.067 --> 00:18:25.904 line:95%,end
it would make me feel
very uncomfortable.

00:18:25.971 --> 00:18:27.306 line:95%,end
I thought it was good.

00:18:27.372 --> 00:18:29.108 line:95%,end
It's just I think
that you need to make

00:18:29.174 --> 00:18:31.810 line:95%,end
more eye contact throughout the dance.

00:18:31.877 --> 00:18:34.012 line:95%,end
ABBY: On every step
should be a moment

00:18:34.079 --> 00:18:35.414 line:95%,end
where you're looking at somebody.

00:18:35.481 --> 00:18:37.149 line:95%,end
-I looked at her eyes.
-But you can't argue with the people.

00:18:37.216 --> 00:18:38.717 line:95%,end
You have to say, okay, thank you.

00:18:38.784 --> 00:18:40.786 line:95%,end
And you need
to apply it to yourself.

00:18:40.853 --> 00:18:44.656 line:95%,end
People wouldn't waste the time
to tell you if it wasn't true.

00:18:44.723 --> 00:18:46.992 line:95%,end
MADDIE: It's just the little,
like, in-between stuff

00:18:47.059 --> 00:18:49.461 line:95%,end
that is a little bit, like, messy.

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:54.633 line:95%,end
ABBY: All right. The group is next.
We are flying 3,000 miles away.

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:57.569 line:95%,end
Nobody there knows
the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:18:57.636 --> 00:19:00.239 line:95%,end
You are representing
my entire career.

00:19:22.427 --> 00:19:24.096 line:95%,end
Push!

00:19:24.163 --> 00:19:25.697 line:95%,end
Turn! Go, kick!

00:19:25.764 --> 00:19:26.965 line:95%,end
Come on!

00:19:27.032 --> 00:19:29.635 line:95%,end
<i>Whether we succeed</i>

00:19:29.701 --> 00:19:31.270 line:95%,end
You're late, Chloe. You can't be late.

00:19:31.336 --> 00:19:33.906 line:95%,end
It's all up to her.

00:19:33.972 --> 00:19:36.375 line:95%,end
I'm telling you,
the pressure is on you.

00:19:36.441 --> 00:19:38.143 line:95%,end
You can't screw
that whole thing up.

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:42.681 line:5%,start
CHLOE: This week, Miss Abby
assigned me to a solo, a trio,

00:19:42.748 --> 00:19:44.917 line:5%,start
and I was featured
in the group number.

00:19:44.983 --> 00:19:46.451 line:95%,end
So I kind of felt pressure.

00:19:46.518 --> 00:19:47.486 line:95%,end
<i>I was a little bit nervous.</i>

00:19:47.553 --> 00:19:48.587 line:95%,end
ABBY: You're guessing.


00:19:48.654 --> 00:19:51.156 line:95%,end
And you need Maddie
to tell you when to do it.

00:19:51.223 --> 00:19:52.224 line:95%,end
That's the problem.

00:19:52.291 --> 00:19:54.793 line:95%,end
You need to know the music.

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:58.063 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:02.067 line:95%,end
GIANNA: Two, three,
four, down, up, up.

00:20:02.134 --> 00:20:03.902 line:95%,end
That was--that was closer.

00:20:05.337 --> 00:20:07.372 line:95%,end
-MELISSA: Her hip hurts?
-Yeah.

00:20:07.439 --> 00:20:08.674 line:95%,end
GIANNA: You okay, Chlo?

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:09.808 line:95%,end
What's wrong?

00:20:09.875 --> 00:20:11.009 line:95%,end
My hip hurts.

00:20:11.076 --> 00:20:11.944 line:95%,end
Just stand.

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:13.645 line:95%,end
You--you can mark the turns.

00:20:13.712 --> 00:20:14.646 line:95%,end
What hurts?

00:20:16.848 --> 00:20:18.784 line:95%,end
All right.
Sit down for a second.

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:21.720 line:95%,end
Do you think there's ice?
Could I give her some ice?

00:20:21.787 --> 00:20:23.388 line:95%,end
Five, six, seven, eight...

00:20:23.455 --> 00:20:24.690 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>As Chloe's rehearsing,</i>

00:20:24.756 --> 00:20:26.792 line:95%,end
I really can see that something is wrong.

00:20:26.858 --> 00:20:29.895 line:95%,end
(suspenseful music playing)

00:20:32.364 --> 00:20:33.966 line:95%,end
Yeah.
It's been bugging you, huh?

00:20:34.032 --> 00:20:35.901 line:95%,end
Is it--is it your same boo-boo?

00:20:35.968 --> 00:20:37.603 line:95%,end
No. It's a different one.

00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:38.503 line:95%,end
What happened?

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:40.305 line:95%,end
I mean, my right here
when I was turning.

00:20:40.372 --> 00:20:42.507 line:95%,end
It's--it's your hip flexors.

00:20:42.574 --> 00:20:45.277 line:95%,end
If it hurts, I'd rather have you rest
and be ready

00:20:45.344 --> 00:20:47.412 line:95%,end
than just to hurt yourself more
in rehearsal.

00:20:47.479 --> 00:20:48.347 line:95%,end
Yeah.

00:20:48.413 --> 00:20:50.182 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>I'm worried</i>
<i>that Chloe's injured.</i>

00:20:50.249 --> 00:20:51.817 line:95%,end
And I don't want Chloe
to injure herself

00:20:51.883 --> 00:20:54.620 line:95%,end
because she's afraid to speak up
and say that she's hurt.

00:20:54.686 --> 00:20:56.788 line:95%,end
Open your mouth and say something
if your leg hurts.

00:20:56.855 --> 00:20:57.956 line:95%,end
-Okay?
-Mm-hmm.

00:20:58.023 --> 00:20:59.324 line:95%,end
Okay. All right.

00:20:59.391 --> 00:21:00.392 line:95%,end
Thank you.

00:21:01.693 --> 00:21:03.195 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>Chloe's actually in pain.</i>

00:21:03.262 --> 00:21:04.997 line:95%,end
<i>But I think</i>
<i>she's really holding up well</i>

00:21:05.063 --> 00:21:07.299 line:95%,end
because she knows
that this is her week to shine.

00:21:07.366 --> 00:21:09.268 line:95%,end
And I don't think
she would give it up for anything.

00:21:09.334 --> 00:21:11.136 line:95%,end
(tense music playing)

00:21:11.203 --> 00:21:13.372 line:95%,end
Oh, I'm glad
to see you're working.

00:21:13.438 --> 00:21:17.542 line:95%,end
After learning a number
and not finishing it,

00:21:17.609 --> 00:21:20.345 line:95%,end
<i>she forgot her dance</i>
<i>and stayed out on stage</i>

00:21:20.412 --> 00:21:21.980 line:95%,end
<i>with a blank look on her face.</i>

00:21:22.047 --> 00:21:24.082 line:95%,end
<i>I knew Maddie was about to crack.</i>

00:21:24.149 --> 00:21:26.318 line:95%,end
I never had that opportunity
to tell Maddie that.

00:21:26.385 --> 00:21:28.553 line:95%,end
We never discussed
you forgetting your dance

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:29.955 line:95%,end
and running off the stage.

00:21:30.022 --> 00:21:33.091 line:5%,start
MADDIE: I don't really know
what happened to me in New Jersey.

00:21:33.158 --> 00:21:35.727 line:5%,start
I kind of just blanked out
and I forgot all the moves

00:21:35.794 --> 00:21:37.195 line:95%,end
and just ran off stage.

00:21:37.262 --> 00:21:38.664 line:95%,end
It's my reputation.

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:40.465 line:95%,end
Do you know that dance?

00:21:40.532 --> 00:21:43.035 line:95%,end
I made you do it again, could you do it?

00:21:43.101 --> 00:21:45.404 line:95%,end
-My solo?
-ABBY: Uh-huh.

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:47.439 line:95%,end
<i>I want to see</i>
<i>Maddie's "Heart" solo.</i>

00:21:47.506 --> 00:21:49.341 line:95%,end
I want to see
if she can do this number.

00:21:49.408 --> 00:21:52.411 line:95%,end
(piano music playing)

00:21:54.279 --> 00:21:56.648 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>Watching Maddie</i>
<i>rehearse this routine</i>

00:21:56.715 --> 00:21:58.884 line:95%,end
<i>really makes me want to see her</i>
<i>do it on stage.</i>

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:01.019 line:95%,end
<i>I've put a lot of time</i>
<i>into this choreography</i>

00:22:01.086 --> 00:22:04.656 line:95%,end
and I know that this is going to be
a winning routine for Maddie.

00:22:08.627 --> 00:22:10.295 line:95%,end
(applause)

00:22:10.362 --> 00:22:14.333 line:95%,end
ABBY: I want you prepared
to do this number anywhere,

00:22:14.399 --> 00:22:16.535 line:95%,end
any time, any place.

00:22:16.601 --> 00:22:18.103 line:95%,end
Because, when you least expect it,

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:20.205 line:95%,end
I'm going to throw you
out there to do it.


00:22:23.141 --> 00:22:25.344 line:5%,start
(upbeat music playing)

00:22:26.445 --> 00:22:29.448 line:5%,start
ABBY: So remember, girls,
competition starts right now.

00:22:29.514 --> 00:22:31.450 line:5%,start
Got it? All right.
Let's go, girls.

00:22:31.516 --> 00:22:33.785 line:5%,start
NexStar is pretty much
what I thought it would be.

00:22:33.852 --> 00:22:36.988 line:5%,start
<i>It's one of those competitions</i>
<i>that people bring</i>

00:22:37.055 --> 00:22:38.457 line:95%,end
<i>tons and tons of numbers to.</i>

00:22:38.523 --> 00:22:42.294 line:95%,end
Lots of money is spent there,
and it's an all day long affair.

00:22:42.361 --> 00:22:44.262 line:95%,end
KELLY: Okay. What's first?
Do we know?

00:22:44.329 --> 00:22:45.364 line:95%,end
-The group...
-GIANNA: Solos.

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:46.631 line:95%,end
-KELLY: ...or the trio?
-GIANNA: Trio. Trio.

00:22:46.698 --> 00:22:48.700 line:95%,end
ABBY: All right. Listen, guys,
you need to get fired up.

00:22:48.767 --> 00:22:49.701 line:95%,end
You need to get out there.

00:22:49.768 --> 00:22:50.902 line:95%,end
I think we have a chance.

00:22:50.969 --> 00:22:52.104 line:95%,end
I'm watching what's out there.

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:53.372 line:95%,end
Now, I could be wrong.

00:22:53.438 --> 00:22:55.707 line:95%,end
It might be novice
because it was really--

00:22:55.774 --> 00:22:56.808 line:95%,end
-it was bad.
-Yeah.

00:22:56.875 --> 00:23:01.346 line:95%,end
ABBY: Upon arrival, I'm looking
at the program and Maddie is listed.

00:23:01.413 --> 00:23:04.449 line:95%,end
We originally had sent
an entry in for her to do a solo.

00:23:04.516 --> 00:23:05.617 line:95%,end
She always does a solo.

00:23:05.684 --> 00:23:07.552 line:95%,end
Come here.

00:23:07.619 --> 00:23:09.755 line:95%,end
Remember how I told you that in pyramid,

00:23:09.821 --> 00:23:12.457 line:95%,end
that I had entered her solo
and then I canceled it

00:23:12.524 --> 00:23:14.226 line:95%,end
because of what happened last time?

00:23:14.292 --> 00:23:15.660 line:95%,end
-Uh-huh.
-ABBY: It's still in there.

00:23:15.727 --> 00:23:16.628 line:95%,end
Okay.

00:23:16.695 --> 00:23:19.097 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>I knew it.</i>
<i>I knew there was no way</i>

00:23:19.164 --> 00:23:21.266 line:95%,end
<i>that Abby and Melissa</i>
<i>could go through a competition</i>

00:23:21.333 --> 00:23:22.968 line:95%,end
<i>without letting Maddie have a solo.</i>

00:23:23.034 --> 00:23:26.271 line:5%,start
It's so frustrating because it puts
so much more pressure on Chloe.

00:23:26.338 --> 00:23:27.806 line:95%,end
<i>Because now Chloe's looking at it</i>

00:23:27.873 --> 00:23:30.041 line:95%,end
<i>thinking that she's not enough</i>
<i>to lead this team.</i>

00:23:30.108 --> 00:23:32.778 line:95%,end
I scratch her,
it looks really bad.

00:23:32.844 --> 00:23:35.580 line:95%,end
-She doesn't know it.
-So I think she has to dance.

00:23:36.948 --> 00:23:41.019 line:95%,end
Chances are, they are going
to announce contestant number

00:23:41.086 --> 00:23:43.455 line:95%,end
whatever, Maddie, is a scratch.

00:23:43.522 --> 00:23:46.625 line:95%,end
Then the whole auditorium
and every kid here dancing

00:23:46.691 --> 00:23:50.228 line:95%,end
are going to know
that you were supposed to do something

00:23:50.295 --> 00:23:51.830 line:95%,end
and you chose not to do it.

00:23:53.098 --> 00:23:54.299 line:95%,end
I know you have a tummy ache.

00:23:54.366 --> 00:23:56.067 line:95%,end
But what if you did a Broadway show
eight times a week?

00:23:56.134 --> 00:24:00.038 line:95%,end
Would you call in sick tonight
or would you go?

00:24:00.105 --> 00:24:01.673 line:95%,end
Next week I'll do it.

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:02.841 line:95%,end
Next week?

00:24:02.908 --> 00:24:03.942 line:95%,end
But next week
you're not in the program.

00:24:04.009 --> 00:24:05.744 line:95%,end
We don't know
who gets to dance next week.

00:24:06.812 --> 00:24:08.613 line:95%,end
I think next week I will.

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.348 line:95%,end
<i>Miss Abby me to do my solo.</i>

00:24:10.415 --> 00:24:13.618 line:95%,end
<i>And I really want to do it</i>
<i>because I don't want to make her mad.</i>

00:24:13.685 --> 00:24:15.954 line:95%,end
<i>But I haven't been so confident.</i>

00:24:16.021 --> 00:24:18.457 line:5%,start
I just--in the back of my mind
I always say,

00:24:18.523 --> 00:24:20.292 line:5%,start
I can't forget this dance.

00:24:20.358 --> 00:24:21.560 line:95%,end
I don't want to be distracted.

00:24:21.626 --> 00:24:23.361 line:95%,end
I can't lose place or anything.

00:24:23.428 --> 00:24:25.964 line:95%,end
You know I believe in you,
that I don't think you're a big failure.

00:24:26.031 --> 00:24:27.365 line:95%,end
Yeah?

00:24:27.432 --> 00:24:29.367 line:95%,end
You have to believe in yourself, though.

00:24:29.434 --> 00:24:31.002 line:95%,end
So maybe you could go later.

00:24:31.069 --> 00:24:33.572 line:95%,end
<i>This has to do with the reputation</i>
<i>that precedes us.</i>

00:24:33.638 --> 00:24:36.775 line:95%,end
You know, when Abby enters a student,
they are backstage.

00:24:36.842 --> 00:24:38.777 line:95%,end
They're prepared,
they're ready to go on.

00:24:38.844 --> 00:24:40.979 line:95%,end
So when they say
that the kid is scratched,

00:24:41.046 --> 00:24:42.881 line:95%,end
it just makes all of us look bad.

00:24:42.948 --> 00:24:44.382 line:95%,end
(applause)

00:24:45.383 --> 00:24:49.554 line:95%,end

Abby will yell at me.

00:26:23.648 --> 00:26:26.685 line:95%,end
I think the trio went really well
except I forgot a kick.

00:26:26.751 --> 00:26:29.621 line:95%,end
And... I'm going to get a lot of trouble.


00:26:30.155 --> 00:26:32.824 line:95%,end
Paige, do you know you forgot a step?

00:26:34.025 --> 00:26:35.660 line:95%,end
You did? What happened?

00:26:37.462 --> 00:26:39.331 line:95%,end
Well, don't laugh about it.
It's not funny.

00:26:41.333 --> 00:26:43.969 line:95%,end
You can't go out there and not do
the choreography you were given.

CHRISTI: <i>After the trio, Abby walks in.</i>

00:26:46.104 --> 00:26:47.973 line:95%,end
<i>And, of course, she blames Paige.</i>

00:26:48.039 --> 00:26:49.608 line:95%,end
Paige is the original fall guy.

00:26:49.674 --> 00:26:52.077 line:95%,end
Abby comes in, you didn't kick your leg.

00:26:52.577 --> 00:26:54.546 line:95%,end
And, apparently,
if you don't kick your leg,

00:26:54.613 --> 00:26:57.816 line:95%,end
that is the end of the world
in the Abby Lee Dance Company.

Paige00 Armageddon, it's upon you.

00:27:00.952 --> 00:27:01.953 line:95%,end
You didn't kick.

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:05.323 line:95%,end
I don't think we're not going to win
because she missed a kick.

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:08.126 line:95%,end
I think we're going to lose
because the choreography wasn't

00:27:08.193 --> 00:27:09.694 line:95%,end
like the ones--

00:27:09.761 --> 00:27:11.229 line:95%,end
like, before us, just from what I saw.

00:27:11.296 --> 00:27:13.832 line:95%,end
I saw two dances and they were amazing.

00:27:13.898 --> 00:27:15.200 line:95%,end
You saw a duet?

00:27:15.266 --> 00:27:17.736 line:95%,end
Well, I didn't see what you saw,
so I don't know.

00:27:17.802 --> 00:27:20.572 line:95%,end
All right, well, that's it.

00:27:20.639 --> 00:27:21.906 line:95%,end
Mother knows best.

00:27:26.378 --> 00:27:29.347 line:95%,end
Does it feel better when you win
or does it feel better when you lose?

00:27:29.414 --> 00:27:31.116 line:95%,end
-Win.
-When you win.

00:27:31.182 --> 00:27:33.251 line:95%,end
So don't go out there
and make any mistakes.

00:27:33.318 --> 00:27:36.454 line:95%,end
You love the dance,
it's cute, it looks great.

00:27:36.921 --> 00:27:39.324 line:95%,end
If you don't win we'll blame it
on your mother's stirrup feet.

I'm really nervous about my solo

She definitely worked it.

Are you okay? What did you hurt?

00:28:59.104 --> 00:29:00.905 line:95%,end
It hurt so I got off stage.

00:29:00.972 --> 00:29:03.341 line:95%,end
It hurt so you got off stage. Okay.

00:29:04.142 --> 00:29:06.277 line:95%,end
She hurt her leg,
and she tried to stay out there.

00:29:06.344 --> 00:29:07.312 line:95%,end

horrible kid all day.

00:29:25.263 --> 00:29:27.599 line:95%,end
Yes? So put a smile on your face.

00:29:27.665 --> 00:29:29.033 line:95%,end
So you're lucky.

Maddie, come put this costume on
for me, please.

It's your decision.

You were put in.

00:30:00.498 --> 00:30:01.666 line:95%,end
You paid the entrance fee.

00:30:01.733 --> 00:30:04.102 line:95%,end
I automatically assumed,
which was wrong of me,

00:30:04.169 --> 00:30:05.770 line:95%,end
that you would be doing a solo this week.

00:30:05.837 --> 00:30:08.173 line:95%,end
After what happened
at the last competition

00:30:08.239 --> 00:30:10.375 line:95%,end
I said, too much pressure.

00:30:10.441 --> 00:30:12.377 line:95%,end
She's not going to do anything
this week with the group.

00:30:12.443 --> 00:30:14.479 line:95%,end
Let her get her head back on straight,
that's fine.

00:30:14.546 --> 00:30:16.848 line:95%,end
Fine. Now we get here,
it's still in the program.

00:30:16.915 --> 00:30:19.784 line:95%,end
I had Maddie run that number again
in the dressing room

00:30:19.851 --> 00:30:21.019 line:95%,end
I forced the kid to do it.

00:30:21.486 --> 00:30:23.955 line:95%,end
So it's your decision,
we just need to know.

00:30:24.022 --> 00:30:26.658 line:95%,end
I don't want to make you mad,
but I'm just, like,

it's tough getting to the top.

in yourself.

-ABBY: She's late!

00:39:42.146 --> 00:39:44.181 line:95%,end
-ABBY: Come to class!
-You only--you only give them

00:39:44.248 --> 00:39:45.683 line:95%,end
practice with their turns.

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:47.752 line:95%,end
-Give me other two who are in the group.
-She's in the same studio

00:39:47.818 --> 00:39:49.053 line:95%,end
with the same teachers!

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:50.554 line:95%,end
-Work on it with them! You sit there!
-Girls, go--go in here.

00:39:50.621 --> 00:39:52.022 line:95%,end
-Work on it with them!
-Go in here, love.

00:39:52.089 --> 00:39:53.224 line:95%,end
ABBY: Okay, honey, right now let's go.

00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:54.525 line:95%,end
-Go ahead!
-Thity-two fouettes.

00:39:54.592 --> 00:39:55.826 line:95%,end
Go! Go!

00:39:55.893 --> 00:39:58.429 line:95%,end
-Go!
-Well, obviously she can't do 32 fouettes.

00:39:58.496 --> 00:40:00.064 line:95%,end
-She can't do one!
-HOLLY: Girls...

00:40:00.131 --> 00:40:01.899 line:95%,end
-Work on it with them. You're her teacher.
-HOLLY: ...out.

00:40:01.966 --> 00:40:04.068 line:95%,end
ABBY: Kelly, don't be so stupid
all the time!

00:40:04.135 --> 00:40:05.636 line:95%,end
-KELLY: I'm not stupid, Abby.
-ABBY: Yes, you are!

00:40:05.703 --> 00:40:07.371 line:95%,end
KELLY: Don't you be a bad teacher!

00:40:07.438 --> 00:40:09.440 line:95%,end
-I put the the dances in it!
-HOLLY: Girls!

00:40:09.507 --> 00:40:12.443 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I find it so insulting
that Abby came into the room

00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:14.412 line:95%,end
and told our kids
that they weren't committed.

00:40:14.478 --> 00:40:17.047 line:95%,end
Those kids bust their butts for her.

00:40:17.114 --> 00:40:18.616 line:95%,end
I'm not happy with what I saw!

00:40:18.682 --> 00:40:20.518 line:95%,end
KELLY: Ask every single one of these women

00:40:20.584 --> 00:40:22.620 line:95%,end
who have been sitting out there
watching choreography.

00:40:22.686 --> 00:40:24.021 line:95%,end
Yours sucks.

00:40:24.088 --> 00:40:25.856 line:5%,start
You know nothing, Kelly!

00:40:25.923 --> 00:40:28.225 line:5%,start
KELLY: I definitely think
that Abby's choreography

00:40:28.292 --> 00:40:29.360 line:5%,start
is getting stale.

00:40:29.427 --> 00:40:31.028 line:5%,start
I think she's been doing this
for too long.

00:40:31.095 --> 00:40:33.497 line:5%,start
Maybe I need to go somewhere else,
me and Christi.

00:40:34.231 --> 00:40:36.167 line:5%,start
Christi and I, you idiot!

00:40:36.233 --> 00:40:37.368 line:5%,start
-Christi and I!
-Oh, (bleep) you.

00:40:37.435 --> 00:40:39.637 line:5%,start
-CHRISTI: Oh, my god.
-You've lost it, Abby.

00:40:39.703 --> 00:40:41.605 line:5%,start
You've been doing it too long.

00:40:41.672 --> 00:40:42.706 line:5%,start
You're stale.

00:40:42.773 --> 00:40:44.475 line:5%,start
My stale is better

00:40:44.542 --> 00:40:46.243 line:5%,start
than your best day will ever be.

00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:47.478 line:5%,start
(laughter)

00:40:47.545 --> 00:40:49.346 line:5%,start
Look in the mirror, girlfriend.
Look in the mirror.

00:40:49.413 --> 00:40:50.414 line:5%,start
Please.

00:40:50.481 --> 00:40:52.216 line:5%,start
Don't eat me, Abby. Don't eat me.

00:40:52.283 --> 00:40:53.984 line:5%,start
-CHRISTI: You know what?
-KELLY: (laughs)
