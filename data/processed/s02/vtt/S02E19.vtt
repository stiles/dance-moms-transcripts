ABBY: <i>Previously on </i>Dance Moms...

00:00:03.536 --> 00:00:05.171 line:5%,start
Brooke is going away this weekend

00:00:05.238 --> 00:00:06.272 line:5%,start
so I'm looking to replace her.

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.974 line:5%,start
Here comes Peyton again.

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:10.377 line:5%,start
Peyton has had some
altercations with our girls.

00:00:10.443 --> 00:00:12.012 line:5%,start
I don't care if you don't like me.

00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:13.646 line:5%,start
No one wants you here, Leslie.

00:00:13.713 --> 00:00:14.881 line:5%,start
Oh, guess what? I'm here.

ABBY: <i>Star Power</i>

A tenth of a point.

You almost won.

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:27.794 line:5%,start
I'm taking her over to
the other competition.

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:28.962 line:5%,start

MITCHELL: We are ready
to create a winning number.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.178 line:5%,start
Jill called me yesterday.

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:47.547 line:5%,start
She said that she's been driving so far.

00:00:47.614 --> 00:00:49.582 line:5%,start
Here's my violin. I'm so sad for Jill.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.152 line:5%,start
KELLY: <i>With the choreography</i>

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:53.453 line:5%,start
<i>Kendall is going to beat her.</i>

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.756 line:5%,start
Step up your choreography
so she has a chance to beat Kendall.

00:00:56.823 --> 00:00:57.657 line:5%,start
Come on.

00:00:57.724 --> 00:00:58.858 line:5%,start
We'll just do it really quick.

00:00:59.459 --> 00:01:01.995 line:5%,start

ABBY: <i>Come on, girls. Let's go.</i>

00:01:20.713 --> 00:01:22.348 line:95%,end
I'm so glad you could make it.

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:26.252 line:95%,end
Okay, let's talk about
Woodbridge, Virginia.

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:29.789 line:95%,end
Your tenth of a point loser,
it's time to cowboy up here.

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:33.193 line:95%,end
The Abby Lee Dance Company
is somebody to beat.

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:34.928 line:95%,end
They're not thrilled that they won.

00:01:35.562 --> 00:01:37.297 line:95%,end
They're thrilled that they beat you.

00:01:37.363 --> 00:01:39.099 line:95%,end
You need to challenge yourself.

00:01:39.165 --> 00:01:42.969 line:95%,end
So if your leg's here,
find the girl in class who's leg is here

00:01:43.036 --> 00:01:44.637 line:95%,end
and go stand next to her at the bar.

00:01:44.704 --> 00:01:45.972 line:95%,end
Fight for that.

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:47.507 line:95%,end
That's how you get better.

00:01:47.574 --> 00:01:50.877 line:95%,end
You have to want to win
more than I want it for you.

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:53.279 line:95%,end
Now, I want to talk about this week.

00:01:53.346 --> 00:01:56.282 line:95%,end
We will be traveling to Ohio.

00:01:57.317 --> 00:01:58.918 line:95%,end
(girls exclaims)

00:01:58.985 --> 00:02:00.553 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>Oh, yippee, skippy.</i>

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.322 line:5%,start
We're going Ohio this week.

00:02:02.388 --> 00:02:05.024 line:5%,start
I can't wait to see my bestie Cathy.

00:02:05.091 --> 00:02:06.626 line:95%,end
ABBY: We might see Kendall.

00:02:07.727 --> 00:02:09.696 line:95%,end
And we might see Vivi-Anne.

00:02:09.762 --> 00:02:11.131 line:95%,end
Oh, my God.

00:02:11.197 --> 00:02:14.534 line:95%,end
All I know is that the Abby League
Dance Company

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:17.270 line:95%,end
will be so hot
that they will become apple pie,

00:02:17.337 --> 00:02:21.207 line:95%,end
and your group is going to be
like the a la mode.

00:02:22.075 --> 00:02:26.146 line:95%,end
The name of the group dance
is "Land Unforgiven".

00:02:26.212 --> 00:02:27.881 line:95%,end
It's about territory.

00:02:27.947 --> 00:02:30.683 line:95%,end
We are going to Cathy's territory.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.820 line:95%,end
We're going to stick a stake
right into that beef jerky.

00:02:34.888 --> 00:02:37.223 line:95%,end
Everybody standing before me
is in the group dance.

00:02:38.258 --> 00:02:42.462 line:95%,end
However, I'm going to bring
a few ringers in,

00:02:43.096 --> 00:02:45.999 line:95%,end
just like the Wicked Witch of the West.

00:02:46.065 --> 00:02:48.735 line:5%,start
This is the first time
that we're going to see Cathy

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:51.771 line:5%,start
and those stinking, little rotten Apples

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:53.506 line:95%,end
since they beat us in New Jersey.

00:02:53.573 --> 00:02:56.009 line:95%,end
<i>If we have a chance</i>
<i>to even get to nationals,</i>

00:02:56.075 --> 00:02:58.411 line:95%,end
we need to beat her and beat her big time.

00:02:59.078 --> 00:03:01.514 line:95%,end
<i>She always uses older dancers</i>
<i>in her routines.</i>

00:03:02.348 --> 00:03:04.250 line:95%,end
<i>Let's fight fire with fire.</i>

00:03:04.317 --> 00:03:06.186 line:95%,end
I'm going to put a few of my older girls

00:03:06.252 --> 00:03:07.487 line:95%,end
in this week's routine.

00:03:07.554 --> 00:03:10.723 line:95%,end
So let's start
at the bottom of the pyramid.

00:03:11.257 --> 00:03:14.327 line:95%,end
Brooke, you're still on probation.

00:03:14.394 --> 00:03:16.763 line:95%,end
<i>Obviously Brooke was</i>
<i>at the bottom of the pyramid.</i>

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.665 line:95%,end
I mean, she wasn't even there.

00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:22.802 line:95%,end
This weekend is my first
formal school dance

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:25.972 line:95%,end
and I was wondering
if I would be able to go to it.

00:03:26.706 --> 00:03:29.108 line:95%,end
<i>She was in her eighth grade</i>
<i>farewell dinner dance.</i>

00:03:29.943 --> 00:03:31.110 line:95%,end
Bye bye.

00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:34.214 line:95%,end
Next, we have Mackenzie.

00:03:35.114 --> 00:03:36.482 line:95%,end
How did you get down there? What happened?

00:03:39.752 --> 00:03:41.588 line:95%,end
How many times did I tell you
to spit your gum out?

00:03:42.121 --> 00:03:43.623 line:95%,end
Maybe 10.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.058 line:95%,end
So that's nine times too many.

00:03:45.124 --> 00:03:46.226 line:95%,end
Next.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:48.895 line:95%,end
Nia, I think you're there

00:03:48.962 --> 00:03:51.331 line:95%,end
because you had a hard time
with those turns

00:03:51.397 --> 00:03:53.666 line:95%,end
and it was your legs
that needed straightened.

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:57.003 line:95%,end
So all that technique
you worked on, what happened?


00:03:58.771 --> 00:04:00.540 line:5%,start
Next we have Paige.

00:04:00.873 --> 00:04:02.108 line:5%,start
You see that probation sticker?

00:04:03.042 --> 00:04:04.777 line:95%,end
Hopefully that's going to come off there.

00:04:05.144 --> 00:04:08.114 line:95%,end
Next we have Chloe.

00:04:08.381 --> 00:04:11.417 line:95%,end
Group dance is where you made the mistake.

00:04:12.051 --> 00:04:15.054 line:95%,end
(mellow music playing)

00:04:18.057 --> 00:04:19.058 line:95%,end
Solo was good.

00:04:19.492 --> 00:04:22.061 line:95%,end
The first person on top
of the pyramid is Maddie.

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:27.333 line:95%,end
And the second person on top
of the pyramid is also Maddie.

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.438 line:95%,end
I guess Maddie's picture
is kind of like a gremlin.

00:04:32.505 --> 00:04:34.240 line:95%,end
<i>You just add water and they multiply.</i>

00:04:34.307 --> 00:04:36.342 line:95%,end
ABBY: Now, I want to congratulate Maddie,

00:04:37.076 --> 00:04:40.580 line:95%,end
two crowns, two titles
in less than two hours.

00:04:40.647 --> 00:04:42.248 line:95%,end
There she is.

00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:43.816 line:95%,end
-(screams)
-Whoo-hoo.

00:04:43.883 --> 00:04:45.551 line:95%,end
Two titles in one day.

00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:46.786 line:95%,end
That's pretty darn good.

00:04:47.587 --> 00:04:49.956 line:95%,end
Maddie may be on top of the pyramid twice,

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.258 line:95%,end
but that doesn't mean
she's going to get a solo.

00:04:52.325 --> 00:04:55.628 line:95%,end
I want her to be well rested
and I want her to be a champion.

00:04:56.462 --> 00:04:58.031 line:95%,end
Paige, you're 11.

00:04:58.698 --> 00:05:03.336 line:95%,end
You're going to be
our title entrance, nine to 11.

00:05:03.403 --> 00:05:07.373 line:95%,end
<i>Paige will be competing directly</i>
<i>against Kendall for the title.</i>

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.842 line:95%,end
I need Paige to show Jill and Kendall

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:13.846 line:95%,end
that leaving the Abby Dance Company
was the biggest mistake of their lives.

00:05:13.913 --> 00:05:15.815 line:95%,end
You will be doing "Tongue Twister".

00:05:15.882 --> 00:05:18.051 line:95%,end
It's your responsibility to know it.

00:05:18.117 --> 00:05:19.786 line:95%,end
She will not have a rehearsal.

00:05:19.852 --> 00:05:21.321 line:95%,end
She's welcome to use the studio,

00:05:21.387 --> 00:05:23.256 line:95%,end
but she has to get in here on her own.

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:25.792 line:95%,end
Paige's solo is one she does well.

00:05:25.858 --> 00:05:29.095 line:95%,end
In fact, she's entered it,
then pulled it twice.

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:30.730 line:95%,end
<i>She should know this choreography</i>

00:05:30.797 --> 00:05:32.231 line:95%,end
<i>like the back of her hand.</i>

00:05:32.298 --> 00:05:34.133 line:95%,end
And I want to see a crown on your head.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.268 line:95%,end
Do you understand?

00:05:35.968 --> 00:05:41.307 line:95%,end
All righty. So I'm going to take
this probation off right now.

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:44.344 line:95%,end
I think Paige is going
to be a nervous wreck,

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:48.715 line:95%,end
but I know if she does
the routine that I gave her,

00:05:48.781 --> 00:05:50.516 line:95%,end
<i>she will hold her own.</i>

00:05:50.583 --> 00:05:52.952 line:95%,end
Chloe, you will also be doing a solo.

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:55.355 line:95%,end
It's entitled "Angry Bird".

00:05:55.788 --> 00:05:59.592 line:95%,end
The whole bird solo thing
isn't really new for Chloe.

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:01.594 line:95%,end
<i>She's been a swan, a raven.</i>

00:06:01.661 --> 00:06:03.229 line:95%,end
<i>This week she's an angry bird.</i>

00:06:03.296 --> 00:06:04.731 line:95%,end
So I don't know, what's next?

00:06:04.797 --> 00:06:05.932 line:95%,end
Maybe a peacock?

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:09.802 line:95%,end
All right, so ladies, you're dismissed.
Thank you.

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:11.237 line:95%,end
Girls, spread apart.

00:06:11.304 --> 00:06:12.405 line:95%,end
Real quick, let's go.

00:06:12.472 --> 00:06:15.475 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:06:19.545 --> 00:06:22.014 line:95%,end
I thought it was weird
that Maddie was on there twice,

00:06:22.081 --> 00:06:25.551 line:95%,end
only because nobody else
was given the opportunity

00:06:25.618 --> 00:06:26.652 line:95%,end
to do two dances.

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:28.087 line:95%,end
Like next week there'll be three Maddies

00:06:28.154 --> 00:06:30.123 line:95%,end
and she'll be the whole
top of the pyramid.

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:31.991 line:5%,start
MELISSA: Moms were giving me crap
because Maddie's

00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:34.427 line:5%,start
on the top of the pyramid twice
because she won two crowns

00:06:34.494 --> 00:06:35.328 line:5%,start
in one day.

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:37.163 line:95%,end
<i>If their kids won two crowns in one day,</i>

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.599 line:95%,end
I'm sure Abby would put their
kid up there twice, too.

00:06:39.665 --> 00:06:41.334 line:95%,end
She was really happy
when Abby said she didn't have

00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:42.235 line:95%,end
a solo this week.

00:06:42.301 --> 00:06:43.369 line:95%,end
She was like, oh.

00:06:43.436 --> 00:06:45.104 line:95%,end
She very pleased.

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:47.607 line:95%,end
Girls, listen to me.

00:06:47.673 --> 00:06:49.609 line:5%,start
We're going to our next door neighbor

00:06:49.675 --> 00:06:51.277 line:5%,start
and we're taking their territory.

00:06:51.344 --> 00:06:53.112 line:95%,end
She always throws those ringers in there.

00:06:53.179 --> 00:06:55.148 line:95%,end
I'm going to pull three ringers in, too.

00:06:55.214 --> 00:07:00.219 line:95%,end
I would like to introduce Katherine
from the Elite Company.

00:07:00.286 --> 00:07:03.523 line:95%,end
And this is Ariel from the Team Company.

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:04.957 line:95%,end
(cheering)

00:07:05.024 --> 00:07:09.128 line:95%,end
And this is Nina, who you all know,
from the Senior Company.

00:07:09.195 --> 00:07:10.830 line:95%,end
(cheering)

00:07:10.897 --> 00:07:13.132 line:95%,end
I want to make sure that we beat Cathy.

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:15.301 line:95%,end
I just want to even out the playing field.

00:07:15.368 --> 00:07:19.205 line:95%,end
If Cathy wants to play all these games,
who am I to argue?

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:21.841 line:95%,end
I have to say, you know,
I'm a little offended

00:07:21.908 --> 00:07:23.910 line:95%,end
that she needs to bring in "ringers".

00:07:23.976 --> 00:07:26.045 line:95%,end
She is always the first to criticize Cathy

00:07:26.112 --> 00:07:28.181 line:95%,end
for putting those older girls
and other girls in the group,

00:07:28.247 --> 00:07:30.082 line:95%,end
but she can't wait to do it.

00:07:30.149 --> 00:07:32.051 line:95%,end
She's not above it, obviously.

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:34.654 line:5%,start
I think it's incredibly
hypocritical for Abby

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.757 line:5%,start
to always talk about Cathy
putting older girls in the group,

00:07:37.824 --> 00:07:40.159 line:95%,end
and then this week
she's going to do the same thing

00:07:40.226 --> 00:07:42.328 line:95%,end
by adding older girls to her group number.

00:07:42.395 --> 00:07:43.930 line:95%,end
So you're saying to these kids,

00:07:43.996 --> 00:07:45.264 line:95%,end
you can't beat her on your own,

00:07:45.331 --> 00:07:47.333 line:95%,end
even though they have
done nothing but beat her,

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.268 line:95%,end
except for one time.

00:07:52.371 --> 00:07:54.207 line:95%,end
CATHY: <i>Hey, Apples, let's go.</i>

00:07:54.273 --> 00:07:55.107 line:95%,end
<i>Come on, kids.</i>

00:07:55.808 --> 00:07:59.212 line:95%,end
Everybody, I have a really
cool surprise for you.


00:07:59.712 --> 00:08:01.180 line:95%,end
First of all, let me tell you
about the piece

00:08:01.247 --> 00:08:02.248 line:95%,end
that we're going to be doing.

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:04.484 line:95%,end
We are doing an Asian piece.

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:06.252 line:95%,end
And the whole thing is going to be

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:08.321 line:95%,end
that there's an Asian princess

00:08:08.387 --> 00:08:10.189 line:95%,end
with all the little lotus flowers,

00:08:10.256 --> 00:08:13.993 line:95%,end
and that there are two very handsome
Ming dynasty warriors

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.262 line:95%,end
that are fighting over the Asian princess,

00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:17.363 line:95%,end
which is going to be Vivi.

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:21.801 line:95%,end
She has to decide which
handsome young man she wants.

00:08:23.035 --> 00:08:25.571 line:95%,end
JILL: <i>When I first started</i>
<i>at Candy Apples,</i>

00:08:26.038 --> 00:08:28.574 line:95%,end
<i>Cathy was gangbusters over Kendall.</i>

00:08:28.641 --> 00:08:31.511 line:5%,start
She was getting her
all kinds of dance opportunities

00:08:31.577 --> 00:08:34.680 line:5%,start
and it was great,
but things have changed a little bit.

00:08:34.747 --> 00:08:38.050 line:95%,end
That's kind of died down
and now we're just another number.

00:08:38.117 --> 00:08:40.753 line:95%,end
Here is what is the amazing surprise.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.856 line:95%,end
Could I please have my guest
choreographers come in?

00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:46.626 line:95%,end
(applause)

00:08:46.692 --> 00:08:49.562 line:5%,start
Everybody, this is Mitchell Bing

00:08:49.629 --> 00:08:51.597 line:5%,start
and this is his assistant Michael.

00:08:51.664 --> 00:08:55.801 line:95%,end
So they'll be doing
the choreography for you.

00:08:55.868 --> 00:08:58.638 line:95%,end
Mitchell confided to me that
over the past couple of weeks,

00:08:58.704 --> 00:09:02.909 line:95%,end
he has seen the ever famous
Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:09:02.975 --> 00:09:05.611 line:95%,end
JILL: So Cathy doesn't have time
to choreograph a new number

00:09:05.678 --> 00:09:07.747 line:95%,end
for our kids to compete against Abby,

00:09:07.813 --> 00:09:12.018 line:95%,end
so she brings in not one,
but two choreographers.

00:09:12.418 --> 00:09:15.021 line:95%,end
MITCHELL: We are ready to create
a winning number for you.

00:09:15.087 --> 00:09:16.022 line:95%,end
Yay.

00:09:16.489 --> 00:09:18.157 line:95%,end
-CATHY: All right.
-MITCHELL: All right, let's go.

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:19.258 line:95%,end
-All right.
-MITCHELL: Let's go to work.

00:09:19.325 --> 00:09:20.192 line:95%,end
Good luck.

00:09:22.128 --> 00:09:24.931 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:09:29.735 --> 00:09:31.837 line:5%,start
(indistinct) Use your pliÃ©.

00:09:31.904 --> 00:09:33.773 line:95%,end
Don't dance like a stick, Chloe.

00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:37.944 line:95%,end
Then 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:40.813 line:95%,end
MADDIE: <i>I'm so excited</i>
<i>that Miss Abby put the older girls</i>

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.884 line:5%,start
in our group routine,
because I really look up to them.

00:09:44.951 --> 00:09:46.352 line:95%,end
Everybody, you're dismissed.

00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:48.487 line:95%,end
Paige, you need to be in class.

00:09:48.554 --> 00:09:49.722 line:95%,end
So do you.

00:09:49.789 --> 00:09:51.357 line:95%,end
Are you excited for Paige this week?

00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:52.792 line:95%,end
You know, I'm excited for Paige

00:09:52.858 --> 00:09:54.660 line:95%,end
because she's getting the opportunity,

00:09:54.727 --> 00:09:58.064 line:95%,end
-but I don't think it's a fair chance.
-No, I agree.

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:00.633 line:95%,end
I don't think that the dance
is choreographed well.

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:04.170 line:95%,end
She's been trying to do this dance
since last summer at nationals

00:10:04.236 --> 00:10:05.071 line:95%,end
and it keeps getting pulled.

00:10:05.137 --> 00:10:06.839 line:95%,end
KELLY: I just hope
she goes better than Kendall,

00:10:06.906 --> 00:10:08.174 line:95%,end
and I know that sounds terrible.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.241 line:95%,end
-HOLLY: No it doesn't.
-MELISSA: No.

00:10:09.308 --> 00:10:10.543 line:95%,end
-No.
-HOLLY: No it doesn't.

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:12.311 line:5%,start
We're upstairs in the viewing room

00:10:12.378 --> 00:10:15.214 line:95%,end
<i>and we're watching the girls</i>
<i>take gymnastics class.</i>

00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:17.249 line:95%,end
Abby put so much pressure on these girls

00:10:17.316 --> 00:10:19.085 line:95%,end
to beat Candy Apple this week,

00:10:19.151 --> 00:10:21.220 line:95%,end
so why are they taking gymnastics class?

00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:23.122 line:95%,end
Why aren't they working on their solos?

00:10:23.189 --> 00:10:25.224 line:95%,end
My favorite part of pyramid
was when she said,

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:28.094 line:95%,end
Paige, you need to win this crown.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.796 line:95%,end
No excuses, but no practice for you
with any teachers.

00:10:30.863 --> 00:10:32.665 line:95%,end
-Do it on your own.
-KELLY: I know. Do it on your own.

00:10:32.732 --> 00:10:34.567 line:95%,end
I think I'm going to go down
and say something.

00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:36.002 line:95%,end
-Do you want to go down?
-CHRISTI: Yes.

00:10:36.068 --> 00:10:38.838 line:95%,end
I might as well join you
because I certainly have a few things

00:10:38.904 --> 00:10:40.006 line:95%,end
to get off my chest.

00:10:40.072 --> 00:10:41.874 line:95%,end
Christi and I are going to go down
and talk to Abby

00:10:41.941 --> 00:10:43.876 line:95%,end
because I have a few choice words
I want to say to her

00:10:43.943 --> 00:10:45.311 line:95%,end
about Paige's choreography.

00:10:45.378 --> 00:10:46.612 line:95%,end
-Abby?
-Yes.

00:10:46.679 --> 00:10:48.514 line:95%,end
-Can we speak to you for a moment?
-ABBY: Certainly.

00:10:48.581 --> 00:10:49.415 line:95%,end
What's up?

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:51.884 line:95%,end
There is a lot expected
of our girls this week

00:10:51.951 --> 00:10:52.952 line:95%,end
-with everything going on.
-ABBY: Yes.

00:10:53.019 --> 00:10:54.987 line:95%,end
<i>Why are they in a gymnastics class</i>

00:10:55.054 --> 00:10:56.255 line:95%,end
<i>and not working on their solos?</i>

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:59.291 line:95%,end
Well, your daughter
is really weak at gymnastics

00:10:59.358 --> 00:11:00.960 line:95%,end
then she needs to work on it.

00:11:01.027 --> 00:11:03.195 line:95%,end
My daughter pays for a class here.

00:11:03.262 --> 00:11:05.431 line:95%,end
Someone has to teach her her dance.

00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:08.034 line:95%,end
She's known her dance since last summer.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:11.904 line:95%,end
KELLY: Abby, she learned her dance
for an hour last summer.

00:11:11.971 --> 00:11:13.906 line:95%,end
We pulled it because she didn't know it

00:11:13.973 --> 00:11:15.141 line:95%,end
and the costume didn't work,

00:11:15.207 --> 00:11:18.277 line:95%,end
and she learned it for an hour last week
and has never run it since.

00:11:18.344 --> 00:11:19.445 line:95%,end
That's two hours.

00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:21.514 line:95%,end
KELLY: That is not teaching
my daughter to dance.

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:24.050 line:95%,end
Kelly should be glad Paige has a solo.

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:26.952 line:95%,end
After pulling it
and pulling it and pulling it...

00:11:27.853 --> 00:11:30.089 line:95%,end
that kid shouldn't even
get a solo anymore.

00:11:30.423 --> 00:11:31.357 line:95%,end
She knows the dance.

00:11:31.424 --> 00:11:32.658 line:95%,end
Yeah, and it sucks.

00:11:33.225 --> 00:11:34.093 line:95%,end
Let's just put it this way.

00:11:34.493 --> 00:11:37.596 line:95%,end
With the choreography that Paige has,
Kendall is going to beat her.

00:11:38.197 --> 00:11:41.000 line:95%,end
-She does a bunch of hit moves and--
-Poses.

00:11:41.067 --> 00:11:42.068 line:95%,end
Poses.

00:11:42.134 --> 00:11:43.369 line:95%,end
Put something in it.

00:11:43.436 --> 00:11:45.438 line:95%,end
Go in there, step up the choreography

00:11:45.504 --> 00:11:47.740 line:95%,end
so she has a chance to beat Kendall.

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:50.509 line:95%,end
But you won't do that because it's Paige.


00:11:52.878 --> 00:11:55.915 line:5%,start
(upbeat music playing)

00:11:59.785 --> 00:12:01.654 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>So today I'm going to go</i>
<i>to lunch with Christi.</i>

00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:03.989 line:95%,end
<i>I really need somebody to talk to</i>

00:12:04.056 --> 00:12:05.758 line:5%,start
about what to do about
Paige's choreography.

00:12:05.825 --> 00:12:08.060 line:95%,end
I'd like a glass of water
and a cosmopolitan.

00:12:08.127 --> 00:12:08.961 line:95%,end
Absolutely.

00:12:09.028 --> 00:12:10.296 line:95%,end
-I'll have the same.
-Okay.

00:12:10.362 --> 00:12:12.131 line:95%,end
I need a drink to go back to the studio

00:12:12.198 --> 00:12:15.034 line:95%,end
and watch my daughter's dance
because the choreography sucks.

00:12:15.101 --> 00:12:17.303 line:95%,end
Oh, well, Chloe's choreography
sucked last week.

00:12:17.837 --> 00:12:19.338 line:95%,end
So I feel your pain, sister.

00:12:19.405 --> 00:12:23.275 line:5%,start
Kelly and I really just want Abby to give
the same amount of attention to detail

00:12:23.342 --> 00:12:26.212 line:95%,end
for our children's dances
as she does for Maddie's dances.

00:12:26.278 --> 00:12:28.314 line:95%,end
She's in the 11-year-old category

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:30.382 line:95%,end
-and she's shaking her butt.
-I know.

00:12:30.783 --> 00:12:32.051 line:95%,end
Are you going to hire a choreographer?

00:12:32.118 --> 00:12:33.119 line:95%,end
I'm not going to hire a choreographer

00:12:33.185 --> 00:12:35.721 line:95%,end
because then
that will just be World War III.

00:12:35.788 --> 00:12:37.590 line:95%,end
Like I'm not doing that.

00:12:37.656 --> 00:12:38.991 line:95%,end
You're going to do it yourself.

00:12:39.058 --> 00:12:40.392 line:95%,end
I am going to do it myself.

00:12:40.459 --> 00:12:42.762 line:95%,end
You know, I danced at Abby's
years ago myself,

00:12:42.828 --> 00:12:44.430 line:95%,end
<i>and I may have forgotten a few steps,</i>

00:12:44.497 --> 00:12:46.766 line:95%,end
but I think I can handle
a little re-choreographing.

00:12:46.832 --> 00:12:50.169 line:95%,end
Do you think Abby will notice
if I changed Paige's dance?

00:12:50.236 --> 00:12:51.504 line:95%,end
She's going to be mad.

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:54.039 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>Abby is not a rational person.</i>

00:12:54.106 --> 00:12:57.176 line:95%,end
Even if Kelly is the one
who changes Paige's choreography,

00:12:57.243 --> 00:12:58.944 line:95%,end
Abby's going to take that out on Paige.

00:12:59.011 --> 00:13:02.481 line:95%,end
<i>And you're setting your daughter up</i>
<i>to take the wrath of Khan.</i>

00:13:02.548 --> 00:13:03.749 line:95%,end
Bla.

00:13:03.816 --> 00:13:07.853 line:95%,end
Just know that you really are
going to open up

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:08.854 line:95%,end
-a huge fight.
-KELLY: I don't care.

00:13:08.921 --> 00:13:11.056 line:95%,end
What more can of worms can I open?

00:13:11.123 --> 00:13:13.759 line:95%,end
(tense music playing)

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.963 line:5%,start
(suspenseful music playing)

00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:21.767 line:5%,start
MITCHELL: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:13:21.834 --> 00:13:23.469 line:5%,start
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:13:23.536 --> 00:13:26.539 line:5%,start
CATHY: In order to try
and secure a victory,

00:13:26.605 --> 00:13:29.408 line:5%,start
<i>I've brought in two guest choreographers</i>

00:13:29.475 --> 00:13:33.646 line:95%,end
<i>who are doing a routine</i>
<i>to end all routines,</i>

00:13:33.712 --> 00:13:36.682 line:95%,end
and Abby is going down this weekend.

00:13:36.749 --> 00:13:38.250 line:95%,end
MITCHELL: Bend, and then up.

00:13:38.818 --> 00:13:40.052 line:95%,end
Vivian by herself, go.

00:13:40.119 --> 00:13:41.720 line:95%,end
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.

00:13:41.787 --> 00:13:43.289 line:95%,end
There you go. Good.

00:13:43.355 --> 00:13:47.593 line:95%,end
Now 1, 2, 3, and 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Word.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:48.661 line:95%,end
-Oh.
-Yes.

00:13:48.727 --> 00:13:49.962 line:95%,end
-CATHY: That was sweet.
-Good.

00:13:50.029 --> 00:13:51.230 line:95%,end
That gave me a cavity.

00:13:51.297 --> 00:13:53.866 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:14:00.539 --> 00:14:03.209 line:95%,end
CATHY: I think that Kendall, overall,
is a nice talent

00:14:03.275 --> 00:14:05.044 line:95%,end
and I think she has a lot of potential.

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:07.479 line:95%,end
<i>I just wish that, technically,</i>

00:14:07.546 --> 00:14:09.882 line:95%,end
maybe we would kick it up a notch.

00:14:09.949 --> 00:14:12.551 line:95%,end
You're just sitting here
and you're just looking straight forward,

00:14:12.618 --> 00:14:13.719 line:95%,end
and the judges are out there

00:14:13.786 --> 00:14:15.888 line:95%,end
so you need to make eye contact
with the judges.

00:14:15.955 --> 00:14:17.122 line:95%,end
-You know what I mean?
-Yes.

00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:19.358 line:95%,end
Okay. Open, pop.

00:14:20.359 --> 00:14:22.094 line:95%,end
Pop. Pretty hands.

00:14:22.428 --> 00:14:24.063 line:95%,end
Here at Candy Apples,

00:14:24.129 --> 00:14:28.300 line:95%,end
you have to treat every rehearsal


00:14:28.367 --> 00:14:30.970 line:95%,end
<i>as if you are performing,</i>

00:14:31.036 --> 00:14:33.305 line:95%,end
and I don't think that Kendall's
on our page yet

00:14:33.372 --> 00:14:34.540 line:95%,end
when it comes to that.

00:14:34.607 --> 00:14:36.909 line:95%,end
-Nice rehearsal that we had.
-Good.

00:14:36.976 --> 00:14:38.777 line:95%,end
So nothing you wanted to change, Cathy?

00:14:38.844 --> 00:14:39.879 line:95%,end
Oh, no, I don't want change anything.

00:14:41.213 --> 00:14:43.749 line:5%,start
I feel that Cathy needs
to step it up a little bit.

00:14:43.816 --> 00:14:47.119 line:95%,end
Cathy has lost interest
in Kendall as a dancer.

00:14:47.186 --> 00:14:48.721 line:95%,end
Good job.

00:14:48.787 --> 00:14:51.991 line:95%,end
As always, a pleasure
to work with both of you.

00:14:53.559 --> 00:14:56.395 line:5%,start
(upbeat music playing)

00:14:57.429 --> 00:14:59.365 line:5%,start
ABBY: <i>All right, Chloe.</i>
<i>Now remember, we talked about this,</i>

00:15:00.065 --> 00:15:01.634 line:5%,start
angry bird.

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:02.835 line:5%,start
I need to see you in character.

00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:05.638 line:95%,end
I need to see beautiful feathers.

00:15:05.704 --> 00:15:06.972 line:95%,end
I need to see strength.

00:15:07.039 --> 00:15:09.241 line:95%,end
CHLOE: <i>This week</i>
<i>my solo is called "Angry Bird".</i>

00:15:09.308 --> 00:15:10.976 line:5%,start
I guess I do well with dark numbers

00:15:11.043 --> 00:15:13.279 line:5%,start
because a lot of people
have told me that I do.

00:15:13.345 --> 00:15:15.447 line:95%,end
So I try not to be darker in real life,

00:15:15.514 --> 00:15:18.717 line:95%,end
<i>but on stage you have to perform,</i>
<i>so I have to perform.</i>

00:15:22.454 --> 00:15:27.126 line:5%,start
The "Angry Bird" piece
is contemporary in style,

00:15:27.192 --> 00:15:30.229 line:95%,end
but it has a lot of ballet
technique behind it,

00:15:30.296 --> 00:15:32.898 line:95%,end
and Chloe excels at that.

00:15:34.833 --> 00:15:36.602 line:95%,end
Jill called me yesterday and, um--

00:15:36.669 --> 00:15:38.137 line:95%,end
Why are you still talking to her?

00:15:38.203 --> 00:15:39.905 line:95%,end
Oh, I think this is really sweet.

00:15:39.972 --> 00:15:41.240 line:95%,end
-Yeah, she's sweet all right.
-I like her.

00:15:41.307 --> 00:15:44.910 line:95%,end
But she said that
she's been driving so far,

00:15:44.977 --> 00:15:47.313 line:95%,end
which is ridiculous
that she's driving two hours.

00:15:47.379 --> 00:15:49.248 line:95%,end
Here's my violin. I'm so sad for Jill.

00:15:49.315 --> 00:15:50.549 line:95%,end
She's so excited to see us
over the weekend.

00:15:50.616 --> 00:15:52.084 line:95%,end
You made your bed. Lie in it.

00:15:52.484 --> 00:15:53.786 line:95%,end
ABBY: Down. Ouch.

00:15:53.852 --> 00:15:55.120 line:95%,end
You got to hit that split.

00:15:55.187 --> 00:15:57.756 line:95%,end
Jill said Cathy can't choreograph things
like Abby does.

00:15:57.823 --> 00:16:00.292 line:95%,end
I mean, she knows that,
so she had to bring someone in.

00:16:00.359 --> 00:16:01.827 line:95%,end
Oh, so she's afraid.

00:16:01.894 --> 00:16:03.696 line:95%,end
She must really want to win.

00:16:03.762 --> 00:16:06.465 line:95%,end
(applause)

00:16:06.532 --> 00:16:07.366 line:95%,end
Very nice.

00:16:07.433 --> 00:16:08.467 line:95%,end
Very nice.

00:16:10.703 --> 00:16:12.171 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>You know what we need to change,</i>

00:16:12.237 --> 00:16:14.873 line:95%,end
is this thing where you do--
what is that thing,

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:16.976 line:95%,end
where you go like this and like this?

00:16:17.042 --> 00:16:18.310 line:95%,end
Could we change that?

00:16:18.877 --> 00:16:20.245 line:95%,end
Okay, because that's ugly.

00:16:20.746 --> 00:16:22.681 line:95%,end
I want to change Paige's dance.

00:16:22.748 --> 00:16:24.750 line:95%,end
And I know by me doing that,

00:16:24.817 --> 00:16:26.051 line:95%,end
<i>Paige is going to get in trouble,</i>

00:16:26.118 --> 00:16:28.854 line:95%,end
but I'm really just doing this
to help my kid.

00:16:28.921 --> 00:16:31.123 line:95%,end
Then how about you do like
a fan kick or something up?

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:32.291 line:95%,end
Yeah.

00:16:36.228 --> 00:16:37.296 line:95%,end
Okay.

00:16:37.363 --> 00:16:39.431 line:95%,end
And then we'll add
some harder stuff to it.

00:16:39.498 --> 00:16:42.568 line:95%,end
I don't want to do the dance because
Abby's going to throw a chair again.

00:16:44.336 --> 00:16:45.170 line:95%,end
Done.

00:16:45.237 --> 00:16:46.205 line:95%,end
You're finished.

00:16:46.605 --> 00:16:47.506 line:95%,end
Next?

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:49.575 line:95%,end
Who's solo?

00:16:50.309 --> 00:16:52.211 line:95%,end
We won't even show her that we changed it.

00:16:52.578 --> 00:16:54.613 line:95%,end
Then she's going to yell at me
when I get off stage.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:55.914 line:95%,end
And who cares?

00:16:56.682 --> 00:16:59.685 line:95%,end
(tense music playing)


00:17:01.353 --> 00:17:03.889 line:5%,start
(upbeat music playing)

00:17:06.358 --> 00:17:07.493 line:5%,start
Come on.

00:17:07.559 --> 00:17:08.827 line:5%,start
We'll just do it really quick.

00:17:08.894 --> 00:17:10.829 line:5%,start
<i>This is my chance to take Paige</i>

00:17:10.896 --> 00:17:13.732 line:5%,start
and run her dance one more time
before we get on the bus.

00:17:13.799 --> 00:17:15.501 line:95%,end
<i>She is going for a title</i>

00:17:15.567 --> 00:17:17.236 line:95%,end
and is expected to beat Kendall.

00:17:17.302 --> 00:17:18.871 line:95%,end
PAIGE: I want to do it in "A".

00:17:18.937 --> 00:17:20.873 line:95%,end
I don't want Abby to see the changes,

00:17:20.939 --> 00:17:22.608 line:95%,end
because if she sees them,
she's going to yell at us

00:17:22.674 --> 00:17:24.176 line:95%,end
and then you're not
going to be able to do them.

00:17:24.243 --> 00:17:25.878 line:95%,end
I changed the choreography

00:17:25.944 --> 00:17:28.213 line:95%,end
because I just don't think that this dance

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.682 line:95%,end
is good enough to win a crown
in a junior category.

00:17:30.749 --> 00:17:31.583 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:36.488 line:95%,end
SINGER: <i>âª I'm the sparkle</i>
<i>on your birthday cake âª</i>

00:17:36.555 --> 00:17:37.890 line:95%,end
Point that foot.

00:17:37.956 --> 00:17:38.991 line:95%,end
Whack that leg.

00:17:39.691 --> 00:17:41.293 line:95%,end
Oh, your feet.

00:17:42.294 --> 00:17:45.464 line:95%,end
Okay. Whenever you do this,
aren't you supposed to be looking forward?

00:17:45.531 --> 00:17:47.433 line:95%,end
<i>All the moves</i>
<i>that I'm putting in for Paige</i>

00:17:47.499 --> 00:17:51.336 line:95%,end
I think is really going to make
the dance technically difficult enough

00:17:51.403 --> 00:17:54.006 line:95%,end
that she has a great chance
of beating Kendall.

00:17:54.073 --> 00:17:57.142 line:95%,end
Do you like this way better
than the way she had it?

00:17:57.209 --> 00:17:58.911 line:95%,end
-Yes.
-Well, let's hurry up and get out of here

00:17:58.977 --> 00:17:59.912 line:95%,end
before Abby sees us.

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:04.483 line:5%,start
(upbeat music playing)

00:18:11.924 --> 00:18:13.125 line:95%,end
ABBY: Oh, cool.

00:18:13.192 --> 00:18:14.560 line:95%,end
Definitely don't touch anything.

00:18:14.626 --> 00:18:16.395 line:5%,start
Here we are in Akron, Ohio.

00:18:16.462 --> 00:18:18.063 line:5%,start
This is Cathy's home turf.

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:20.699 line:95%,end
<i>The last time we were</i>
<i>up against her we lost.</i>

00:18:20.766 --> 00:18:22.768 line:95%,end
That's not going to happen again.

00:18:22.835 --> 00:18:24.503 line:95%,end
If we're going to get to nationals,

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:26.939 line:95%,end
we need to take Cathy down.

00:18:27.005 --> 00:18:29.374 line:95%,end
The competition is ahead of schedule.

00:18:29.441 --> 00:18:31.176 line:95%,end
They're running ahead
of schedule 30 minutes.

00:18:31.243 --> 00:18:33.579 line:95%,end
So we thought we had a big break.
We don't.

00:18:33.645 --> 00:18:35.481 line:95%,end
Come on. I don't want you to waste time.

00:18:35.547 --> 00:18:36.715 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>For once in my life,</i>

00:18:36.782 --> 00:18:39.284 line:95%,end
I'm glad that we're rushed
in the dressing room,

00:18:39.351 --> 00:18:41.453 line:95%,end
because I don't think
Abby is going to have enough time

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:42.855 line:95%,end
to run Paige's solo.

00:18:42.921 --> 00:18:44.890 line:95%,end
Paige, remember where those judges are.

00:18:48.994 --> 00:18:50.496 line:95%,end
Come on, stay together.

00:18:50.562 --> 00:18:52.531 line:95%,end
It's time for my dancers to step it up.

00:18:53.165 --> 00:18:55.901 line:5%,start
We're going to walk in there as winners

00:18:55.968 --> 00:18:58.337 line:5%,start
and we are going to walk
out of there as winners.

00:18:58.403 --> 00:19:01.840 line:95%,end
Just think about your energy level, okay?

00:19:01.907 --> 00:19:04.243 line:95%,end
Just lots of personality and style.

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:07.012 line:5%,start
JILL: Kendall is going
directly up against Paige.

00:19:07.079 --> 00:19:09.414 line:5%,start
Kendall has to be at the top of her game.

00:19:10.782 --> 00:19:12.351 line:95%,end
Keep going over it in your head.

00:19:13.051 --> 00:19:13.886 line:95%,end
Okay?

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:17.489 line:95%,end
Two minutes before we walk,
girls, two minutes.

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:19.791 line:95%,end
I'm expecting Paige to go out there,

00:19:19.858 --> 00:19:22.494 line:95%,end
do the routine I taught her,
and beat Kendall.

00:19:23.095 --> 00:19:24.129 line:95%,end
Don't worry about it.

00:19:24.196 --> 00:19:25.097 line:95%,end
It's going to be fine.

00:19:25.464 --> 00:19:26.999 line:95%,end
<i>Paige is a nervous wreck.</i>

00:19:27.366 --> 00:19:28.600 line:95%,end
<i>Abby is expecting her to beat Kendall.</i>

00:19:28.667 --> 00:19:30.469 line:95%,end
She's expecting her to win a title.

00:19:30.536 --> 00:19:32.171 line:95%,end
<i>That's a lot of pressure on her.</i>

00:19:32.237 --> 00:19:33.672 line:95%,end
As long as you go out there
and do it good,

00:19:33.739 --> 00:19:34.873 line:95%,end
she can't say anything.

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:36.742 line:95%,end
I just hope she can pull it off.

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:40.312 line:95%,end
JILL: Cathy is gonna back me up on this.

00:19:40.379 --> 00:19:41.980 line:95%,end
I need to see your center lead

00:19:42.047 --> 00:19:45.417 line:95%,end
and I need to see your elbow stand
and a chin stand.

00:19:45.484 --> 00:19:49.188 line:95%,end
As always, there really is
not enough time for Kendall

00:19:49.254 --> 00:19:50.289 line:95%,end
to go over her number.

00:19:50.889 --> 00:19:52.491 line:95%,end
-Boom. That's nice.
-CATHY: Oh, that was even better.

00:19:52.558 --> 00:19:53.425 line:95%,end
JILL: That's nice.

00:19:53.492 --> 00:19:55.494 line:95%,end
I'm paying a teacher, but as her mother,

00:19:55.561 --> 00:19:57.362 line:95%,end
I have to take her back into the hallway


00:19:57.429 --> 00:19:58.897 line:95%,end
<i>and run her solo for her.</i>

00:20:00.399 --> 00:20:01.867 line:95%,end
ABBY: Chloe, you are a bird

00:20:01.934 --> 00:20:03.902 line:95%,end
from the minute you step on that stage.

00:20:03.969 --> 00:20:05.237 line:95%,end
Get the arms way back.

00:20:05.304 --> 00:20:06.505 line:95%,end
Break the elbows.

00:20:06.572 --> 00:20:09.174 line:95%,end
If something happens, bird steps.

00:20:09.241 --> 00:20:13.412 line:95%,end
(indistinct) all bird-like steps.

00:20:13.478 --> 00:20:15.647 line:95%,end
(indistinct) get it?

00:20:15.714 --> 00:20:17.015 line:95%,end
All right, let's go.

I'm still a little bit nervous.

00:20:27.492 --> 00:20:30.128 line:5%,start
But I think that I just need
to go out there, dance it,

00:20:30.195 --> 00:20:31.597 line:95%,end

Besides your mother's opinion, what else?

00:28:30.508 --> 00:28:32.177 line:95%,end

<i>She actually spoke to Abby and said,</i>

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:44.189 line:95%,end
you know, I didn't like the choreography.
It was too easy.

00:28:44.255 --> 00:28:47.625 line:95%,end
You can't send her for a title
and not have anything in it.

00:28:47.692 --> 00:28:50.662 line:95%,end
The things that she put in it were a mess.

00:28:51.129 --> 00:28:52.263 line:95%,end
If she doesn't challenge herself,

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:54.032 line:95%,end
she's never going to
get better at anything.

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:56.935 line:95%,end
I don't want to put her on the stage

00:28:57.001 --> 00:28:59.003 line:95%,end
and make her do things
she's not ready to do.

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:00.672 line:95%,end
I want her to do what she does well.

00:29:00.739 --> 00:29:02.273 line:95%,end
Is she capable of more?

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:03.408 line:95%,end
Absolutely.

00:29:03.475 --> 00:29:05.310 line:95%,end
But what I gave her was clean

00:29:05.376 --> 00:29:06.978 line:95%,end
and it would have clearly beat Kendall.

00:29:07.045 --> 00:29:08.513 line:95%,end
She went behind my back.

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:12.417 line:95%,end
She threw stuff in it,
and you as a parent condoned it.

00:29:12.484 --> 00:29:13.718 line:95%,end
How dare you.

00:29:14.619 --> 00:29:15.820 line:95%,end
This is my name out there.

00:29:15.887 --> 00:29:17.922 line:95%,end
And as much as you and Christi
and everybody else

00:29:17.989 --> 00:29:20.725 line:95%,end
wants to think it's your kid,
it's your kid, it's your kid,

00:29:20.792 --> 00:29:21.826 line:95%,end
you know what?

00:29:21.893 --> 00:29:22.861 line:95%,end
It's not.

00:29:22.927 --> 00:29:24.796 line:95%,end
You don't go behind somebody's back.

00:29:24.863 --> 00:29:27.465 line:95%,end
Don't raise your kid to be a snake, Kelly.

00:29:27.532 --> 00:29:31.369 line:95%,end
This is Kelly's fault.
I blame the parent, not the child.

00:29:33.938 --> 00:29:34.773 line:95%,end
KELLY: Don't cry.

00:29:34.839 --> 00:29:37.041 line:95%,end
I'm heartbroken because I'm the one

00:29:37.108 --> 00:29:38.743 line:95%,end
that helped her change her dance.

00:29:39.244 --> 00:29:40.411 line:95%,end
Don't be sad.

00:29:41.045 --> 00:29:42.313 line:95%,end
I'm sorry. It's mommy's fault.

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:43.948 line:95%,end
I'm the one that made you change it.


00:29:48.019 --> 00:29:51.256 line:95%,end
Okay, guys,
let's hear a little CADC chant.

00:29:56.828 --> 00:29:59.097 line:95%,end

00:29:59.164 --> 00:30:01.533 line:95%,end
JILL: We beat Abby's before,
we can beat them again.

00:30:02.667 --> 00:30:05.336 line:95%,end
CATHY: Oh, yes,
but it's by one point, remember?

00:30:05.403 --> 00:30:08.072 line:95%,end
-JILL: It doesn't matter.
-CATHY: One point is not a landslide.

00:30:08.139 --> 00:30:11.242 line:95%,end
The last time that we encountered
the Abby Lee Dance Company,

00:30:11.309 --> 00:30:12.844 line:95%,end
we did beat them by one point.

00:30:13.244 --> 00:30:15.647 line:95%,end
<i>We would rather have a landslide victory,</i>

00:30:15.713 --> 00:30:19.918 line:95%,end

00:30:21.252 --> 00:30:22.921 line:95%,end
ABBY: Girls, we have five minutes.

00:30:22.987 --> 00:30:24.589 line:95%,end

Oh, that's beautiful.

00:30:34.199 --> 00:30:37.669 line:95%,end
I decided to bring older girls
to the competition team this week

00:30:37.735 --> 00:30:40.438 line:95%,end
because I want to make sure
that we beat Cathy.

00:30:41.005 --> 00:30:42.407 line:95%,end
<i>Are these girls ringers?</i>

00:30:42.473 --> 00:30:43.675 line:95%,end
Absolutely.

00:30:43.741 --> 00:30:47.011 line:95%,end
Johnny Appleseed came into Ohio,
planted all the apple trees,

00:30:47.078 --> 00:30:48.513 line:95%,end
and we came in to...

00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:50.114 line:95%,end
Chop them down.

00:30:50.181 --> 00:30:51.015 line:95%,end
ABBY: There you go.

00:30:51.082 --> 00:30:52.717 line:95%,end
You own this theater.

00:30:52.784 --> 00:30:53.852 line:95%,end
You own that stage.

00:30:53.918 --> 00:30:55.220 line:95%,end
It is your territory.

00:30:55.286 --> 00:30:58.323 line:95%,end
The last time we met that
Wicked Witch from the West,

00:30:58.389 --> 00:31:02.160 line:95%,end
they beat us, and that is
never going to happen again.

I'm a little concerned about Cathy.

00:31:18.877 --> 00:31:20.845 line:5%,start
You know, all morning long,

00:31:20.912 --> 00:31:22.680 line:5%,start
she hasn't come into our dressing room.

00:31:22.747 --> 00:31:24.582 line:95%,end
She hasn't said a word behind us.

00:31:24.649 --> 00:31:27.752 line:95%,end
She needs more fiber
or some prune juice in her diet

00:31:27.819 --> 00:31:29.988 line:95%,end
because she's just not
feeling like herself.

00:31:30.054 --> 00:31:33.057 line:95%,end

I think Cathy should get
a special judges award

00:32:09.327 --> 00:32:10.895 line:95%,end
for inventing new ways for Vivi

00:32:10.962 --> 00:32:12.997 line:95%,end
<i>to be a human prop in every dance.</i>

00:32:13.831 --> 00:32:14.666 line:95%,end
Whoo.

00:32:14.732 --> 00:32:16.000 line:95%,end
Whoo-hoo.

<i>It was obnoxious.</i>

00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:33.351 line:95%,end
Kind of like Cathy.

00:32:43.428 --> 00:32:46.698 line:95%,end

(cheers and applause)

00:32:52.003 --> 00:32:55.273 line:95%,end

It was completely different

00:37:26.043 --> 00:37:27.712 line:95%,end
ABBY: Congratulations, Chloe.

00:37:27.778 --> 00:37:29.513 line:95%,end
Congratulations, Paige.

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:31.449 line:95%,end
KELLY: Abby congratulates Paige.

00:37:31.916 --> 00:37:34.151 line:95%,end
I know that that had to
kill Abby to do that.

00:37:34.218 --> 00:37:36.420 line:95%,end
I think Paige's
choreography did pretty good.

00:37:36.487 --> 00:37:39.924 line:95%,end
-She got the top 10, right below Chloe.
-She did.

00:37:39.991 --> 00:37:41.592 line:95%,end
KELLY: I just think
that you underestimate Paige.

00:37:41.659 --> 00:37:44.996 line:95%,end
I think that if Paige gets some attention,

00:37:45.062 --> 00:37:48.833 line:95%,end
she has the ability
to go out there and place.

00:37:48.899 --> 00:37:50.468 line:95%,end
I need to see a change in her.

00:37:50.534 --> 00:37:52.570 line:95%,end
She needs to want it, Kelly.

00:37:52.637 --> 00:37:56.274 line:95%,end
You told her at pyramid
you were not working with her.

00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:58.175 line:95%,end
-ABBY: That's true.
-To do it herself. She did it.

00:37:58.242 --> 00:37:59.577 line:95%,end
ABBY: That didn't mean
to change the choreography.

00:37:59.644 --> 00:38:02.680 line:95%,end
That means to just clean up
what I've given you.

00:38:02.747 --> 00:38:04.949 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>If she comes in</i>
<i>with easy choreography again,</i>

00:38:05.016 --> 00:38:06.250 line:95%,end
then you know what?

00:38:06.317 --> 00:38:07.818 line:95%,end
I'm not going to deal with it.

00:38:07.885 --> 00:38:09.553 line:95%,end
I'm going to do the same thing
I did this week.

00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:11.088 line:95%,end
ABBY: You don't know
what my plans are for you.

00:38:11.155 --> 00:38:12.223 line:95%,end
You can't read my mind.

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:14.091 line:95%,end
You have to trust me.

00:38:14.158 --> 00:38:17.395 line:95%,end
I will never forgive Kelly
for putting that kid on the spot.

00:38:17.461 --> 00:38:19.563 line:95%,end
I did not put you in it to fail.

00:38:20.765 --> 00:38:22.099 line:95%,end
You're playing with fire, Kelly.

00:38:25.636 --> 00:38:27.204 line:95%,end
-(applause)
-Yay.

00:38:27.271 --> 00:38:28.272 line:95%,end
Good job.

00:38:28.339 --> 00:38:29.507 line:95%,end
Good job, guys.

00:38:29.974 --> 00:38:31.242 line:95%,end
Good job, guys.

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:36.881 line:95%,end
JILL: They should have been
in the top five.

00:38:36.947 --> 00:38:37.882 line:95%,end
MITCHELL: They should've been
in the top five.

00:38:37.948 --> 00:38:39.483 line:95%,end
Well, the season's not over yet.

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:40.551 line:95%,end
-So about that...
-And next time,

00:38:40.618 --> 00:38:43.454 line:95%,end
let's be a little more prepared
and then, you know, let's--

00:38:43.521 --> 00:38:45.423 line:95%,end
Be prepared? My music sucked.

00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:47.158 line:95%,end
Cathy never even looked at the number.

00:38:48.025 --> 00:38:49.493 line:95%,end
No one cares but me.

00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:51.462 line:5%,start
Kendall doesn't place in the top 10.

00:38:51.529 --> 00:38:52.730 line:5%,start
I'm sick to my stomach.

00:38:52.797 --> 00:38:54.131 line:95%,end
<i>She wasn't prepared.</i>

00:38:54.198 --> 00:38:56.500 line:95%,end
She didn't have anybody
pulling for her but her mother,

00:38:56.567 --> 00:38:58.402 line:95%,end
but sometimes you need
a little more than that.

00:38:58.936 --> 00:39:01.806 line:95%,end
So Apples, first of all,
you have glum faces,

00:39:02.039 --> 00:39:03.074 line:95%,end
and rightfully so.

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:06.210 line:95%,end
I think she was embarrassed
that she spent time and money

00:39:06.277 --> 00:39:09.280 line:95%,end
on those choreographers
and then the kids not placing.

00:39:09.347 --> 00:39:11.349 line:95%,end
I know you have a lot of students,

00:39:11.415 --> 00:39:14.952 line:95%,end
but if you can't give
my student enough time,

00:39:15.019 --> 00:39:17.021 line:95%,end
how can I continue
to keep bringing her to you

00:39:17.088 --> 00:39:18.723 line:95%,end
when you can't give her the time of day?

00:39:18.789 --> 00:39:20.958 line:5%,start
I've just about had it with Jill.

00:39:21.692 --> 00:39:24.695 line:95%,end
It's been a long,
disappointing day for all of us,

00:39:24.762 --> 00:39:28.733 line:95%,end
<i>and she immediately starts</i>
<i>to hound me with questions.</i>

00:39:28.799 --> 00:39:31.602 line:95%,end
I mean, maybe had you given her
a little bit more time,

00:39:31.669 --> 00:39:33.838 line:95%,end
she could have done well in her number.

00:39:37.408 --> 00:39:38.976 line:95%,end
Cathy could have cared less.

00:39:39.043 --> 00:39:42.947 line:95%,end
She had nothing to say
to me or to Kendall.

00:39:43.013 --> 00:39:44.415 line:95%,end
<i>She blows me off.</i>

00:39:44.482 --> 00:39:47.151 line:95%,end
<i>I'm starting to regret</i>
<i>that I pulled Kendall</i>

00:39:47.218 --> 00:39:49.387 line:95%,end
<i>out of Abby's dance group.</i>

00:39:49.453 --> 00:39:52.356 line:95%,end
I think Kendall and I,
our time at the Candy Apples

00:39:52.423 --> 00:39:53.991 line:95%,end
may be drawing to a close.

00:39:54.058 --> 00:39:55.292 line:95%,end
Let's go, guys.

00:39:58.763 --> 00:39:59.730 line:95%,end
Hi, girls.

00:39:59.797 --> 00:40:01.899 line:95%,end
-ABBY: Cathy, how are you doing?
-Fine.

00:40:01.966 --> 00:40:04.034 line:95%,end
ABBY: I'm in Ohio. I'm on your turf.

00:40:04.468 --> 00:40:06.137 line:95%,end
Not even a cocktail party
the night before?

00:40:06.203 --> 00:40:07.838 line:95%,end
No dinner at your house?

00:40:07.905 --> 00:40:10.941 line:95%,end
CATHY: I have to run into Abby
and her goon squad

00:40:11.008 --> 00:40:12.810 line:95%,end
as I'm trying to get on the elevator,

00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:17.148 line:95%,end
and of course their mouths
are running like a typewriter,

00:40:17.214 --> 00:40:20.384 line:95%,end
and I'm not wasting one breath on them.

00:40:20.451 --> 00:40:21.752 line:95%,end
Cathy, come on.

00:40:21.819 --> 00:40:23.187 line:95%,end
Where's your witty repartee?

00:40:23.254 --> 00:40:25.289 line:95%,end
CATHY: <i>You know you brought a good piece.</i>

00:40:25.356 --> 00:40:27.358 line:5%,start
<i>You know your piece is better.</i>

00:40:27.425 --> 00:40:30.227 line:5%,start
You know the teachers
have come up to you and said,

00:40:30.294 --> 00:40:31.595 line:5%,start
this is an outcry.

00:40:31.662 --> 00:40:32.797 line:5%,start
How do you feel about it?

00:40:32.863 --> 00:40:33.697 line:5%,start
What do you do?

00:40:34.131 --> 00:40:37.201 line:5%,start
We will see them again and try harder.

00:40:37.268 --> 00:40:38.502 line:5%,start
There will come a day.

00:40:39.003 --> 00:40:41.472 line:5%,start
Cathy, I can't believe you always
have something to say.

00:40:41.539 --> 00:40:42.740 line:5%,start
Now nothing.

00:40:43.107 --> 00:40:44.408 line:5%,start
<i>Finally we have our revenge.</i>

00:40:45.042 --> 00:40:47.845 line:5%,start
We set out to beat Cathy
and her rotten Apples,

00:40:47.912 --> 00:40:49.580 line:5%,start
and that's exactly what we did.
