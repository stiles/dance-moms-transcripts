00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:04.771 line:5%,start
On top of the pyramid is Brooke.

00:00:04.838 --> 00:00:06.272 line:5%,start
How dare you?
Our history?

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.440 line:5%,start
Don't "how dare" me!

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:08.908 line:5%,start
<i>When can Kendall have a solo?</i>

00:00:08.975 --> 00:00:11.378 line:5%,start
<i>When can Kendall be more a part</i>

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:12.278 line:5%,start
<i>a part of?</i>

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:14.414 line:5%,start
You need to tell your mother
to knock it off.

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:15.949 line:5%,start
She's going to get in trouble.

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:19.352 line:5%,start
In second place,
Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:22.489 line:5%,start
ABBY: <i>Second is the</i>
<i>first one to lose.</i>

00:00:22.555 --> 00:00:24.090 line:5%,start
You did not just
tell me to shut up.

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:26.359 line:5%,start
-Yes!
-I cannot stand this bickering.

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:29.596 line:5%,start
If I have to lose somebody
on this team, I will do that.

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:31.464 line:5%,start
<i>Coming up on</i> Dance Moms...

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:34.100 line:5%,start
Each and every dancer
will be doing a solo.

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:36.169 line:5%,start
Mom gets to help
out with costumes.

00:00:36.236 --> 00:00:38.571 line:5%,start
I have costumes she's never
seen on stage or on my daughter

00:00:38.638 --> 00:00:40.206 line:5%,start
or anybody else.

00:00:40.273 --> 00:00:41.808 line:5%,start
MAN: <i>Dance Explosion</i>

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:43.543 line:5%,start
Oh, my God.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.545 line:5%,start
Let's see if there's another
competition that we could go to.

00:00:45.612 --> 00:00:48.314 line:5%,start
ABBY: <i>There's a competition</i>
<i>in Clute, Texas.</i>

00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:50.183 line:5%,start
-Whatever!
-ABBY: Face it, Jill!

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.119 line:5%,start
I'll pack my bags
and go home right now!

00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:54.454 line:5%,start
I'm sick of this (bleep).

Come on.

-What's with your shoes?
-JILL: I didn't think you'd
mind.

00:01:20.146 --> 00:01:23.216 line:95%,end
-I'm on my toes.
-The floor is $68,000.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.886 line:95%,end
All right.
First I want to talk about last
week.

00:01:26.953 --> 00:01:29.956 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.859 line:95%,end
ABBY:
I must say, I'm a little
disappointed.

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:34.894 line:95%,end
We were just outdanced.

00:01:34.961 --> 00:01:36.129 line:95%,end
It's that energy level.

00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:39.299 line:95%,end
You can't have a bunch
of slugs out on stage.

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:43.937 line:95%,end
This weekend, we will be
attending Dance Explosion

00:01:44.003 --> 00:01:45.905 line:95%,end
in Secaucus, New Jersey.

00:01:45.972 --> 00:01:47.507 line:95%,end
You're going to get some
heavy hitters there,

00:01:47.574 --> 00:01:49.175 line:95%,end
I'm telling you right now.

00:01:49.242 --> 00:01:50.510 line:95%,end
I'm going to start
with the pyramid.

00:01:51.311 --> 00:01:54.714 line:95%,end
And first, I have Kendall.

00:01:55.882 --> 00:01:58.284 line:95%,end
Kendall, I thought
you did a nice job.

00:01:58.351 --> 00:02:02.055 line:95%,end
You're here because your mother
is way too needy.

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:04.357 line:95%,end
Abby, that's ridiculous.

00:02:04.424 --> 00:02:06.593 line:95%,end
Why isn't she doing a solo?
Why isn't she doing a duet?

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.428 line:95%,end
-Why doesn't she have a special
part? -And that's needy?

00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:10.396 line:95%,end
That's inquisitive.
Why doesn't she have a solo?

00:02:10.463 --> 00:02:13.600 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: Kendall's in the very
bottom spot on the pyramid

00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:15.768 line:5%,start
and mommy didn't
like that very much.

00:02:15.835 --> 00:02:17.637 line:95%,end
You're punishing her
for something I did.

00:02:17.704 --> 00:02:19.739 line:95%,end
Bingo! There you go!

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:22.175 line:95%,end
Moving on.

00:02:22.242 --> 00:02:24.944 line:95%,end
Nia, once again, I
need to see energy,

00:02:25.011 --> 00:02:26.412 line:95%,end
I need to see excitement.

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:28.681 line:95%,end
Next we have Brooke.

00:02:29.516 --> 00:02:32.485 line:95%,end
You're back, but is
Brooke really back?

00:02:32.552 --> 00:02:35.555 line:5%,start
BROOKE: <i>I'm really happy to be</i>
<i>back at the Abby Lee Dance</i>
<i>Company,</i>

00:02:35.622 --> 00:02:37.557 line:5%,start
but I just feel a lot
of pressure on me.

00:02:37.624 --> 00:02:38.925 line:95%,end
Moving on.

00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:42.095 line:95%,end
Paige, great job in the tuck.

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:45.865 line:95%,end
I just need to see you do that
throughout all of your dancing.

00:02:45.932 --> 00:02:48.668 line:95%,end
PAIGE: <i>I'm really upset</i>
<i>that I'm not higher on the</i>
<i>pyramid</i>

00:02:48.735 --> 00:02:50.870 line:5%,start
because I had my own
part in the dance

00:02:50.937 --> 00:02:52.205 line:5%,start
and I did really good in it.

00:02:52.272 --> 00:02:53.673 line:95%,end
ABBY: Moving on up the ladder.

00:02:54.474 --> 00:02:56.576 line:95%,end
Maddie, you danced well.

00:02:56.643 --> 00:02:58.178 line:95%,end
I expect more from you.

00:02:58.244 --> 00:03:00.013 line:95%,end
Chloe, same thing.

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:01.481 line:95%,end
Great performance on stage.

00:03:01.548 --> 00:03:03.983 line:95%,end
You just need to learn
to pick up quicker.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.585 line:95%,end
And at the top of the pyramid...

00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:08.021 line:95%,end
Mackenzie.

00:03:08.087 --> 00:03:10.190 line:95%,end
-(mellow music playing)
-(applause)

00:03:11.925 --> 00:03:13.760 line:5%,start
I've never been on
the top of the pyramid,

00:03:13.826 --> 00:03:15.929 line:5%,start
so that's why I'm
really surprised.

00:03:15.995 --> 00:03:18.298 line:95%,end
ABBY: She won in
Nutley, New Jersey.

00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:20.433 line:95%,end
She won in Long
Island, New York.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.103 line:95%,end
Do you have another win
in you for Secaucus, New Jersey?

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.071 line:95%,end
I don't know.

00:03:26.706 --> 00:03:30.443 line:95%,end
We are not going to do
a group routine this week.


00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.446 line:95%,end
Each and every dancer
will be doing a solo.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.482 line:95%,end
It's every man for himself.

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.117 line:95%,end
This is your chance to shine.

00:03:38.184 --> 00:03:40.253 line:95%,end
<i>Every girl is doing</i>
<i>a solo this week,</i>

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.955 line:5%,start
but I still need
to do the pyramid.

00:03:42.021 --> 00:03:45.525 line:95%,end
<i>They need to see how</i>
<i>they rank in my eyes.</i>

00:03:45.592 --> 00:03:47.827 line:95%,end
And for one time only,

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:50.797 line:95%,end
you all get to help
out with the costumes.

00:03:50.863 --> 00:03:53.833 line:95%,end
Since we're doing seven
completely different solos

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.136 line:95%,end
this weekend, I don't have time
to worry about costumes.

00:03:57.203 --> 00:04:00.340 line:95%,end
This is your chance to go
for that Tony, Christi.

00:04:00.406 --> 00:04:02.642 line:95%,end
You're going to come to me,
show me what you have,

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.512 line:95%,end
and I can veto it
or I can accept it.

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:08.615 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: So Abby's final
little surprise at pyramid

00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:11.884 line:95%,end
is that the moms are responsible
for the costumes this week.

00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:15.088 line:95%,end
And there are to be no recycled
costumes and no costumes

00:04:15.154 --> 00:04:16.623 line:95%,end
that she has seen before.

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:18.992 line:95%,end
I don't want to see anything
from any other studios.

00:04:19.058 --> 00:04:22.495 line:95%,end
I want to see you come up
with something original.

00:04:22.562 --> 00:04:24.664 line:95%,end
Moms, I'm going to dismiss you
at this time.

00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:26.633 line:95%,end
Girls, spread apart,
start warming up.

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:29.535 line:5%,start
(techno music playing)

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:34.207 line:95%,end
I'd like to know how
she's going to get seven solos
done

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:36.175 line:95%,end
-in a day.
-MELISSA: In a day.

00:04:36.242 --> 00:04:38.144 line:95%,end
With solos, it's only you.

00:04:38.211 --> 00:04:39.579 line:95%,end
There's no one to hide behind,

00:04:39.646 --> 00:04:41.414 line:95%,end
there's no one to
blame something on.

00:04:41.481 --> 00:04:43.249 line:95%,end
You either go out
there and you kick ass

00:04:43.316 --> 00:04:44.617 line:95%,end
or you fall flat on your face.

00:04:44.684 --> 00:04:47.687 line:5%,start
(techno music playing)

00:04:49.422 --> 00:04:50.556 line:5%,start
ABBY: Stop!

00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:55.028 line:95%,end
My solo's an acro-jazz routine
and it's called

00:04:55.094 --> 00:04:56.262 line:95%,end
<i>Shoulda, Coulda, Woulda.</i>

00:04:56.329 --> 00:04:59.932 line:95%,end
Now, can you, like,
(yawn sound) yawn?

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:03.569 line:95%,end
(yawn sound) Oh, yes!

00:05:03.636 --> 00:05:05.471 line:95%,end
I don't have time
to make a costume.

00:05:05.538 --> 00:05:07.340 line:95%,end
-I mean, it's great that...
-I have to make two!

00:05:07.407 --> 00:05:08.941 line:95%,end
You guys don't
have old costumes?

00:05:09.008 --> 00:05:09.909 line:95%,end
But your kids have been
dancing for years--

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:10.910 line:95%,end
MELLISA:
We're not allowed to use them
again.

00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:12.078 line:95%,end
You're not allowed to use
any of your costumes...

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:14.514 line:95%,end
JILL: I still--I have--
I have tons of costumes.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.149 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I know, but you're not
allowed to use any of them, she
said.

00:05:16.215 --> 00:05:17.216 line:95%,end
-She said none.
-None.

00:05:17.283 --> 00:05:19.752 line:95%,end
-None.
-Trust me, I have costumes she's
never

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:22.522 line:95%,end
seen on stage or on my daughter
or anybody else.

00:05:22.922 --> 00:05:25.358 line:95%,end
-She's not going to know.
-She'll know.

00:05:25.425 --> 00:05:27.894 line:95%,end
Sneaky Jill is telling us that,
oh, I just might use

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.162 line:95%,end
one of Kendall's old costumes

00:05:29.228 --> 00:05:31.230 line:95%,end
because Abby hasn't seen it yet.

00:05:31.297 --> 00:05:33.099 line:95%,end
Well, that's not
playing by the rules.

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:35.101 line:95%,end
You see how it's worked out
for you to speak up

00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:36.202 line:95%,end
about a special part.

00:05:36.269 --> 00:05:37.403 line:95%,end
You got booted down
the end of the pyramid.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:38.538 line:95%,end
And now you're at the bottom
of the pyramid.

00:05:38.604 --> 00:05:40.039 line:95%,end
Now you're gonna go
against the costume thing?

00:05:40.106 --> 00:05:40.940 line:95%,end
I still--I...

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:42.108 line:95%,end
MELISSA: And you came in
with your boots on.

00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:43.176 line:95%,end
-You know what?
-KELLY: Exactly!

00:05:43.242 --> 00:05:44.744 line:95%,end
I want to know
why you got to wear your boots

00:05:44.811 --> 00:05:46.813 line:95%,end
-and I had to take mine off.
-Well, you know what?

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:48.781 line:95%,end
-I get tired of her rules.
-KELLY: I could tiptoe in.

00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:51.617 line:95%,end
And I actually understand
what's going on here.

00:05:51.684 --> 00:05:54.420 line:95%,end
And I won't let that happen
again, where my actions

00:05:54.487 --> 00:05:55.788 line:95%,end
-are going to affect my child.
-CHRISTI: Well, that's all

00:05:55.855 --> 00:05:58.524 line:95%,end
that happens here.
You better go to a new studio.

00:05:58.591 --> 00:06:00.693 line:95%,end
KELLY: You better keep yourself,
like, in a bubble.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.829 line:95%,end
Because anything you do wrong...

00:06:02.895 --> 00:06:05.231 line:95%,end
She's one of those people who,
every time something happens,

00:06:05.298 --> 00:06:06.299 line:95%,end
she writes it into a contract.

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:07.533 line:95%,end
Why do you think
we're still here?

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.769 line:95%,end
We--in our contract it says
because our kids want a title,

00:06:09.836 --> 00:06:13.406 line:95%,end
if we left, that it would cost
us $100,000 in cash

00:06:13.473 --> 00:06:15.842 line:95%,end
within seven days
or she would blackball us

00:06:15.908 --> 00:06:17.009 line:95%,end
in the world of dance.

00:06:17.076 --> 00:06:17.944 line:95%,end
-She's crazy.
-Yeah.

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.712 line:95%,end
-JILL: Well...
-Flat out crazy.

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:22.115 line:5%,start
When you sign up
at the Abbey Lee Dance Company,

00:06:22.181 --> 00:06:23.750 line:5%,start
she makes you sign a contract.

00:06:23.816 --> 00:06:28.020 line:95%,end
And the contract basically says
that she owns you for a year.

00:06:28.087 --> 00:06:29.389 line:95%,end
Yeah, but I don't know.
How much clout does she have?

00:06:29.455 --> 00:06:30.623 line:95%,end
KELLY: Oh, she's got
a lot of connections.

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.792 line:95%,end
Does she ever--
I know kids have left here.

00:06:32.859 --> 00:06:35.261 line:95%,end
Yes, and she's blackballed them
all. She's ruined them.

00:06:35.328 --> 00:06:36.863 line:95%,end
Okay, and you guys
couldn't have told me this

00:06:36.929 --> 00:06:39.832 line:95%,end
-before I came in here.
-CHRISTI: You wanted to come.

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:42.001 line:95%,end
(jazz music playing)

00:06:44.137 --> 00:06:46.005 line:95%,end
Hello, my sweet little Apples.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.208 line:95%,end
So, here we are again.

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:53.679 line:95%,end
Let's go to the PPP,
the perfect positive pyramid,

00:06:53.746 --> 00:06:56.416 line:95%,end
and let's just take a little
look see at what we've got going
on.

00:06:57.683 --> 00:07:01.421 line:95%,end
All of us this
week are all equal.


00:07:02.054 --> 00:07:07.393 line:95%,end
Then we've got that top card
with a big question mark.

00:07:08.227 --> 00:07:10.863 line:95%,end
Now, let's get serious
about this question mark.

00:07:11.464 --> 00:07:16.936 line:95%,end
Abby Lee Dance Center
had an open call for some new
talent.

00:07:17.003 --> 00:07:20.139 line:95%,end
If she can look for new talent,
why can't we?

00:07:21.307 --> 00:07:23.042 line:95%,end
So, here's what
we're going to do.

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:25.478 line:95%,end
We're going to have an open
call, a large crowd,

00:07:25.545 --> 00:07:27.146 line:95%,end
lots of volume and
it's going to be fun.

00:07:27.613 --> 00:07:31.083 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:07:40.359 --> 00:07:43.162 line:5%,start
MADDIE: My solo this week
is a Spanish influence

00:07:43.229 --> 00:07:45.698 line:5%,start
and the song is instrumental.

00:07:45.765 --> 00:07:48.935 line:95%,end
Well, it has some, like,
little Spanish singers in the
back.

00:07:49.001 --> 00:07:52.004 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:07:57.477 --> 00:07:58.544 line:95%,end
(shrieks)

00:07:58.611 --> 00:08:03.416 line:95%,end
You have three days
to get this number clean.

00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:06.419 line:95%,end
And if one thing a
Spanish dance is,

00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:09.489 line:95%,end
is clean and precise.

00:08:09.555 --> 00:08:10.389 line:95%,end
Yes?

00:08:10.456 --> 00:08:11.524 line:95%,end
Yes.

00:08:11.591 --> 00:08:14.293 line:95%,end
I'm seeing a big hot mess,
is what I'm saying.

00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:18.231 line:5%,start
KENDALL: I'm really excited
that I can have my own solo this
week.

00:08:18.297 --> 00:08:22.602 line:5%,start
SINGER: <i>âªFire away, 'cause</i>
<i>I'll take a bullet straight âª</i>

00:08:22.668 --> 00:08:25.137 line:95%,end
<i>âª To the heart for you âª</i>

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:30.743 line:95%,end
<i>âªFan the flames</i>
<i>'cause I love the burning more âª</i>

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:33.613 line:95%,end
<i>âªThan the broken truth âª</i>

00:08:34.547 --> 00:08:37.016 line:95%,end
I know you guys
don't give clout to the pyramid.

00:08:37.083 --> 00:08:38.784 line:95%,end
-HOLLY: Don't beat yourself up
over it. -JILL: I just feel
ashamed

00:08:38.851 --> 00:08:40.820 line:95%,end
and humiliated for my daughter.

00:08:40.887 --> 00:08:43.356 line:5%,start
Kendall deserves to be
at the top of that pyramid.

00:08:43.422 --> 00:08:46.492 line:95%,end
<i>She did a great job</i>
<i>in the group number this week.</i>

00:08:46.559 --> 00:08:48.728 line:95%,end
She did a lot better
than some of the other girls

00:08:48.794 --> 00:08:50.162 line:95%,end
who were ahead of
her in the pyramid.

00:08:50.229 --> 00:08:52.331 line:95%,end
<i>She deserves to be at the top.</i>

00:08:52.398 --> 00:08:54.467 line:95%,end
Did you see how everybody
was so happy for Mackenzie?

00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:55.968 line:95%,end
And when Kendall does make it,
all the kids

00:08:56.035 --> 00:08:57.537 line:95%,end
are going to be
happy for her too.

00:08:57.603 --> 00:09:00.606 line:95%,end
But Nia has to be at the top
too, and so does Paige.

00:09:00.673 --> 00:09:02.575 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I don't necessarily
think that they have to be...

00:09:02.642 --> 00:09:05.645 line:95%,end
JILL: And the best should be at
the top. It shouldn't be...

00:09:05.711 --> 00:09:08.214 line:95%,end
HOLLY: How come whenever
there's Nia or Paige, ever,

00:09:08.281 --> 00:09:11.751 line:95%,end
their names are ever mentioned
of possibly being elevated up

00:09:11.817 --> 00:09:14.754 line:95%,end
the pyramid,
that's when your claws come
out...

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:19.425 line:5%,start
Jill has a tendency to say snide
remarks about certian students.

00:09:19.492 --> 00:09:22.094 line:95%,end
Usually it's Nia,
sometimes it's Paige.

00:09:22.161 --> 00:09:24.530 line:95%,end
And I don't care what Jill says.

00:09:24.597 --> 00:09:27.733 line:95%,end
It is very evident to me
that she sees Nia as a weak
link.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.269 line:95%,end
You weren't even here
all last week, and you show up

00:09:30.336 --> 00:09:31.671 line:95%,end
-and you start...
-HOLLY: I beg your pardon.

00:09:31.737 --> 00:09:34.340 line:95%,end
I do have a job outside
of sitting up here.

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:37.410 line:95%,end
-We know you work hard!
-HOLLY: Good. Thank you.

00:09:37.476 --> 00:09:39.178 line:95%,end
Okay--I've said that
a million times.

00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:40.346 line:95%,end
-I don't know why...
-Not really.

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:41.948 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: We know you said it
a million times.

00:09:42.014 --> 00:09:43.783 line:95%,end
You've said a lot
a million times.

00:09:43.849 --> 00:09:45.251 line:95%,end
Do you ever shut up?
Ever?

00:09:45.318 --> 00:09:47.086 line:95%,end
JILL: All we have to hear about
is I have another child.

00:09:47.153 --> 00:09:49.622 line:95%,end
-I can't do the costume!
-I have a two-year-old!

00:09:49.689 --> 00:09:50.923 line:95%,end
-You have teenagers!
-I know! We all know!

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:52.959 line:95%,end
-We hear it all the time!
-Shut up, Jill!

00:09:54.126 --> 00:09:56.095 line:95%,end

Come on in!
Come on in, if you're a dancer.

00:10:03.502 --> 00:10:07.039 line:95%,end
You guys are here to audition
for Team Apple.

<i>I don't feel that</i>

00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:15.414 line:5%,start
We are definitely going to make
ourselves even stronger yet.

I mean, they compete.
You'll be able to compete here.

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:45.611 line:95%,end
We don't know what's
going to happen.

00:10:45.678 --> 00:10:47.213 line:95%,end
You don't even know
if she's going to ask you to
stay.

00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:50.383 line:5%,start
LESLIE: After all of Abby's
abuse, kicking Peyton off the
team

00:10:50.449 --> 00:10:53.386 line:5%,start
and disrespecting me,
I want to show Abby that we can
find

00:10:53.452 --> 00:10:55.154 line:95%,end
another studio to compete at.

00:10:55.221 --> 00:10:58.824 line:95%,end
And the fact that there's space
available at Cathy's Candy
Apples--

00:10:58.891 --> 00:10:59.825 line:95%,end
icing on the cake.

for the Candy Apples.

00:11:06.966 --> 00:11:08.801 line:95%,end
I know it's up to you, but I
really want you

00:11:08.868 --> 00:11:10.636 line:95%,end
to compete because you know
in your heart you really

00:11:10.703 --> 00:11:12.138 line:95%,end

One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:21.914 line:95%,end
And one...

<i>She had a great face</i>

00:11:24.283 --> 00:11:27.019 line:95%,end
and she was just
selling herself.

00:11:27.086 --> 00:11:30.523 line:95%,end
I'm definitely going to offer
Peyton a spot on the team.

00:11:30.589 --> 00:11:34.360 line:95%,end
What a coup if we can get her
and she's from Abby Lee.

00:11:34.427 --> 00:11:36.595 line:95%,end
Kind of a win-win
situation for me.

00:11:36.662 --> 00:11:38.364 line:95%,end
I get to give Abby
the old little stab

00:11:38.431 --> 00:11:41.233 line:95%,end
in the back-a-rooski,

Um...

00:11:55.314 --> 00:11:57.316 line:95%,end
I would definitely
have to think about it.

00:11:57.883 --> 00:11:59.385 line:95%,end
Are you a spy?

00:11:59.452 --> 00:12:01.954 line:95%,end
-No! No.
-So what's your hold-back then?

00:12:02.021 --> 00:12:03.456 line:95%,end
I just miss my friends.

00:12:03.522 --> 00:12:05.591 line:95%,end
It's a long drive

Hey!

Come on!
What are you doing?

Peyton!

-Thank you, guys.

00:12:31.517 --> 00:12:32.351 line:95%,end
...you should not
be saying that.

00:12:32.418 --> 00:12:34.253 line:95%,end
You should say, it
was my privilege

-to teach your daughter
something. -I think I already...

00:12:36.122 --> 00:12:37.256 line:95%,end
LESLIE: That should

-If you were a positive
educator...

00:12:38.858 --> 00:12:40.860 line:95%,end

that route.

00:12:40.926 --> 00:12:43.729 line:95%,end
Leslie, honestly, you are way
too much like the Pittsburgh

00:12:43.796 --> 00:12:44.797 line:95%,end
Dance Moms for me.

00:12:44.864 --> 00:12:46.165 line:95%,end

I did not sign up to make my
daughter's costume for dance.

CHRISTI: <i>I think Chloe's</i>
<i>solo this week is going</i>

00:13:54.466 --> 00:13:56.802 line:95%,end
<i>to be a little bit more</i>
<i>challenging than the other</i>
<i>girls,</i>

00:13:56.869 --> 00:14:00.105 line:95%,end
<i>simply based on the fact</i>
<i>that she is doing ballet,</i>

00:14:00.172 --> 00:14:01.907 line:5%,start
and there is a right
and there's a wrong.

00:14:01.974 --> 00:14:03.342 line:5%,start
There's no gray area.

PAIGE: My solo this week is
called <i>Make Some Noise,</i>

00:14:17.623 --> 00:14:20.960 line:5%,start
and it's, like, a jazzy
acrobatic routine.

00:14:21.026 --> 00:14:22.761 line:95%,end
And I really like it.

00:14:22.828 --> 00:14:25.464 line:95%,end
-I have a chicken.
-(laughs)

00:14:25.531 --> 00:14:29.568 line:95%,end

1,000.

Hi.

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:32.137 line:95%,end
Hello, ladies.

00:14:32.204 --> 00:14:34.139 line:95%,end
All right, let me
see what you have.

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:37.142 line:95%,end
That looks like
somebody else's costume.

00:14:37.209 --> 00:14:39.945 line:95%,end
Good. Yeah, but that doesn't
look like an Abby Lee Dance
Company costume.

00:14:40.012 --> 00:14:41.580 line:95%,end
All right, moving on. Jill?

00:14:41.647 --> 00:14:45.551 line:95%,end
I got like sunburst,
kind of cheery, a little bit
bright.

00:14:45.618 --> 00:14:47.419 line:95%,end
Sweet little lies.

00:14:47.486 --> 00:14:48.554 line:95%,end
JILL: Sweet.

00:14:48.621 --> 00:14:50.823 line:95%,end
-Black, white, or red?
-Sweet like an orange?

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:52.925 line:95%,end
-ABBY: No.
-JILL: Black, red, or pink?

00:14:52.992 --> 00:14:54.126 line:95%,end
Even white.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.761 line:95%,end
-Okay.
-Okay?

00:14:55.828 --> 00:14:58.564 line:95%,end
I'm going to make this a sarong,
put a rose here

00:14:58.631 --> 00:14:59.598 line:95%,end
and a rose in her hair.

00:14:59.665 --> 00:15:00.900 line:95%,end
You're going to make
it into a sarong?

00:15:00.966 --> 00:15:02.968 line:95%,end
Uh-huh.
Kelly taught me how to do it.

00:15:04.036 --> 00:15:04.937 line:95%,end
Okay.

00:15:05.004 --> 00:15:07.873 line:95%,end
My tutu is being dyed powder
blue. It's home.

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:09.608 line:95%,end
Procrastination station.

00:15:09.675 --> 00:15:10.576 line:95%,end
It was wet.

00:15:10.643 --> 00:15:12.077 line:95%,end
Did you want me to bring it
in here and ruin your floor?

00:15:12.144 --> 00:15:13.245 line:95%,end
ABBY: Why didn't you
just take a picture of it?

00:15:13.312 --> 00:15:15.214 line:95%,end
Well, I can.
I will when I get home.

00:15:15.281 --> 00:15:18.150 line:95%,end
And here's the bra
that I am dying the same color.

00:15:18.217 --> 00:15:19.652 line:95%,end
You're putting your
child in a bra?

00:15:19.718 --> 00:15:22.655 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Yeah. It won't look
like a bra when I'm done with
it, I promise.

00:15:22.721 --> 00:15:24.857 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>Christi doesn't really</i>
<i>have anything to show me.</i>

00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:28.527 line:95%,end
She has to get her act together,
and get it real quick.

00:15:28.794 --> 00:15:30.362 line:95%,end
JILL: Two options for Paige.

00:15:30.429 --> 00:15:32.031 line:95%,end
I can do this.

00:15:32.097 --> 00:15:33.265 line:95%,end
That's loud.

00:15:33.332 --> 00:15:35.834 line:95%,end
-Well, you told me loud.
-ABBY: Right, I know. That's
right.

00:15:35.901 --> 00:15:38.437 line:95%,end
JILL: And booty shorts,
and probably have like some...

00:15:38.504 --> 00:15:40.639 line:95%,end
ABBY: If she's going to
wear shorts that short,

00:15:40.706 --> 00:15:43.242 line:95%,end
the legs better be straight
and the feet better be pointed.

00:15:43.309 --> 00:15:44.376 line:95%,end
Brooke, go to Brooke.

00:15:46.812 --> 00:15:48.847 line:95%,end
That'll work.
All right, listen.

00:15:48.914 --> 00:15:50.049 line:95%,end
Step it up.

00:15:50.115 --> 00:15:53.552 line:95%,end
You do not want to get an hour
from New York City,

00:15:53.619 --> 00:15:57.022 line:95%,end
where they can get any piece of
fabric, any color rhinestone,

00:15:57.089 --> 00:16:00.759 line:95%,end
any applique, any headpiece,
you know, like that.

<i>This is going to</i>
<i>be really rough.</i>

00:16:02.227 --> 00:16:05.631 line:95%,end
I have seven completely
different solos to create,

00:16:05.698 --> 00:16:08.867 line:95%,end
plus overseeing the mothers
of this costume idea.

00:16:08.934 --> 00:16:11.837 line:95%,end
-Oh, my gosh, wait. Hold on.
-Look at this, Paige, look
(indistinct)

00:16:11.904 --> 00:16:14.673 line:95%,end
You guys are growing.
Isn't that sad?

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:16.709 line:95%,end
I like it when you were little.

00:16:16.775 --> 00:16:18.677 line:95%,end

We're leaving in
less than 24 hours.

00:17:07.593 --> 00:17:09.528 line:5%,start
What do you mean the competition
was canceled?

00:17:10.462 --> 00:17:11.997 line:95%,end
That's just unheard of.

00:17:12.631 --> 00:17:13.866 line:95%,end
Heard you wanted to see us.

00:17:13.932 --> 00:17:16.301 line:95%,end
ABBY: Yes, I do.
We have a bit of an issue.

00:17:16.368 --> 00:17:20.606 line:95%,end
This guy calls and says,
I'm calling from Dance Explosion

00:17:20.672 --> 00:17:23.308 line:95%,end
to let you know the competition
this weekend has been canceled

00:17:23.375 --> 00:17:25.110 line:95%,end
because there's not a lot
of people coming.

00:17:25.177 --> 00:17:27.946 line:5%,start
MELLISA: Hearing that the
competition was canceled is
awful.

00:17:28.013 --> 00:17:30.716 line:95%,end
I mean, my daughters
really want to dance.

00:17:30.783 --> 00:17:32.885 line:95%,end
Mackenzie's finally
at the top of the pyramid.

00:17:32.951 --> 00:17:34.953 line:95%,end
And I'm really upset about it.

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:37.056 line:95%,end
So what are our options?

00:17:37.122 --> 00:17:38.490 line:95%,end
ABBY: We have six solos.

00:17:38.557 --> 00:17:40.793 line:95%,end
The kids have worked hard,
and they're going to do

00:17:40.859 --> 00:17:41.727 line:95%,end
the routine somewhere.

Why don't we call around and see

00:17:43.195 --> 00:17:45.197 line:95%,end
if there's another competition
that we could go to?

00:17:48.067 --> 00:17:52.404 line:5%,start
HOLLY: We have seven girls
with dances and no place to go,

00:17:52.471 --> 00:17:56.008 line:5%,start
and Abby has to find a solution
to that situation really fast.

00:17:56.075 --> 00:18:00.946 line:95%,end
Girls, by all means,
do not slack off.

00:18:01.013 --> 00:18:03.949 line:95%,end
I don't care
if there's one person against
you

00:18:04.016 --> 00:18:06.151 line:95%,end
or 1,000 people against you.

00:18:06.218 --> 00:18:08.487 line:95%,end
You should go out
and do the best performance
that you can.

00:18:08.554 --> 00:18:10.089 line:95%,end
-Understood?
-ALL: Yes.

00:18:10.155 --> 00:18:12.758 line:95%,end

Okay, back to class.

Moms, back to work.

Hey, it's Abby.
We have a bit of a crisis.

00:18:19.565 --> 00:18:22.601 line:95%,end
Break through.

<i>Yeah, she's out.</i>

00:18:24.336 --> 00:18:25.170 line:95%,end
Okay.

00:18:25.237 --> 00:18:28.107 line:95%,end
Five, six, seven, eight.

Nope. Nope.

Right now I have seven
completed solo routines

00:18:33.345 --> 00:18:35.080 line:95%,end
<i>and no competition to go to,</i>

00:18:35.147 --> 00:18:37.983 line:95%,end
so I need to find somewhere
for these kids to go.

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:40.752 line:95%,end
We are going to find something
and we are going to go.

00:18:40.819 --> 00:18:42.321 line:95%,end
There we go.

00:18:42.387 --> 00:18:43.722 line:95%,end
Now we're talking.

00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:45.557 line:95%,end
Dance Explosion may
have let me down,

00:18:45.624 --> 00:18:47.960 line:95%,end

Ladies, we are going to a
competition this weekend.

There's a competition in Clute,
Texas, just outside of
Galveston.

I want the girls to
practice tonight.

00:18:57.469 --> 00:18:58.604 line:95%,end
Okay.

00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:01.573 line:95%,end
I'm keeping them here until
their dances are finished and
perfect.

00:19:02.274 --> 00:19:03.609 line:95%,end
The show must go on.

00:19:03.675 --> 00:19:04.910 line:95%,end
Yee-haw.

00:19:04.977 --> 00:19:08.013 line:95%,end

We're excited.

Obviously this is not
what I had intended.

00:19:45.984 --> 00:19:48.787 line:95%,end
It's a gymnasium floor,
so you can handle it.

00:19:48.854 --> 00:19:52.257 line:5%,start
KENDALL: I'm really nervous to
dance on a gymnasium floor

00:19:52.324 --> 00:19:55.093 line:5%,start
because I've never
danced on one before.

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:58.597 line:95%,end
And it's wood,
so I'm scared I might slip.

00:19:58.664 --> 00:20:00.432 line:95%,end
I hope you were guiding
your mothers when they made

00:20:00.499 --> 00:20:02.634 line:95%,end
these costumes, yes?
I hope you weren't sleeping.

00:20:02.701 --> 00:20:07.005 line:95%,end
That costume really has to
sparkle because there's not
stage lights.

00:20:07.773 --> 00:20:10.642 line:95%,end
You know, there's not lights
hitting that costume to make it
sparkle.

00:20:10.709 --> 00:20:12.144 line:95%,end
It has to sparkle on its own.

00:20:12.211 --> 00:20:14.880 line:95%,end
So I'm going to see those before
they go out there, got it?

00:20:14.947 --> 00:20:17.015 line:95%,end
I hope nobody has to
dance naked, ladies.

No.

wasn't mine.

You did not whip
that up last night.

Oh, I never said I

You didn't say go
home and whip up--

I'm not Becky Home Eccy.

I don't whip up costumes.

Where did that
costume come from,

00:22:46.798 --> 00:22:50.535 line:95%,end
because it's obviously not
pieces of something you pulled
together?

00:22:50.602 --> 00:22:52.938 line:95%,end
I just wanted used pieces
that you had at home

00:22:53.004 --> 00:22:54.940 line:95%,end

at the last minute.

00:22:55.006 --> 00:22:56.475 line:95%,end

I came up with.

00:22:56.541 --> 00:22:57.809 line:95%,end
Well, whose is that, may I ask?

This is Kendall's costume.

You have not seen

Somebody somewhere
has seen her in it.

It's Kendall's old costume.

It's Kendall's costume now.

00:23:04.683 --> 00:23:06.118 line:95%,end
It's not one of
her old costumes.

You have something at home,
make it work.

00:23:12.724 --> 00:23:13.558 line:95%,end
It's not about winning.

00:23:13.625 --> 00:23:15.394 line:95%,end
It's about what I want
to put my daughter in.

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:17.996 line:95%,end
No, it's about what I want
to put your daughter in.

-ABBY: Go look at what you have.

00:23:19.531 --> 00:23:21.633 line:95%,end
Figure it out.
Put it on the kid.

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:23.235 line:95%,end
That's looks like
a wedding gown.

00:23:23.301 --> 00:23:24.302 line:95%,end
That's what I did.
That's what I did.

Brooke went out there

wouldn't back me up on this.

Has she ever worn
that costume in the competition

or on stage or a show
or a showcase or a performance

00:23:43.522 --> 00:23:45.157 line:95%,end
or a school gig
or anything else?

00:23:45.223 --> 00:23:47.225 line:95%,end
Yes, but you haven't
seen her in it.

00:23:47.292 --> 00:23:48.293 line:95%,end
None of you have seen her in it.

you.

wearing that hat.

Yes, you know what?
You're exactly right.

00:24:20.392 --> 00:24:22.260 line:95%,end

Yes, but you haven't seen her in

take some shorts and a crop-top,
trim them up a little bit,

It backfired on her.

brokenhearted.

going to regret it.

Well, she's not dancing

At this point, I'm done.

leave?

-Why?

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:20.612 line:95%,end
Do you really need to ask why?

I think you know why.

We will go to the auditorium

End of story. Not having it.

When you're older,
you will understand

00:26:41.833 --> 00:26:44.803 line:95%,end

honey.

HOLLY: Abby pushes these girls
to be as professional as
possible.

00:27:14.966 --> 00:27:18.370 line:5%,start
Sometimes when you're an

<i>even if there's pain.</i>

00:27:19.671 --> 00:27:22.374 line:95%,end

how to dance through the pain.

She's having a lot
of back and hip pain.

00:27:24.843 --> 00:27:27.512 line:95%,end
The hip pain maybe because
you're working really hard at
ballet class.

00:27:27.579 --> 00:27:30.048 line:95%,end
You're using muscles
that you never used before.

to use the inner thigh

keep her not freaking out about
it.

injured.

Injured you should not dance.

00:27:44.896 --> 00:27:46.297 line:95%,end

She said, I danced terrible.

MADDIE: I fell on my hip.

-Yes.

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:23.888 line:95%,end
-Where does it hurt?
-Right here.

00:35:23.955 --> 00:35:25.957 line:95%,end
-Right here?
-Oh, baby.

00:35:26.023 --> 00:35:28.893 line:95%,end
I was gonna do a diving front
walk-over and then I went for
it.

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:30.394 line:95%,end
Then it didn't work.

00:35:30.461 --> 00:35:31.996 line:95%,end
WOMAN: Okay. It's okay, honey.

00:35:32.063 --> 00:35:32.897 line:95%,end
ABBY: Hey.

00:35:33.397 --> 00:35:34.632 line:95%,end
It's okay.

00:35:34.699 --> 00:35:36.634 line:95%,end
MELISSA: She said,
Miss Abby's going to be mad at
me.

00:35:36.701 --> 00:35:39.604 line:95%,end
ABBY: I'm not mad at you,
sweetie, but you started to
dive.

00:35:40.104 --> 00:35:41.172 line:95%,end
MELISSA: She was going to dive.

00:35:41.239 --> 00:35:43.574 line:95%,end
-It was too slippery.
-ABBY: I know.

00:35:43.641 --> 00:35:45.109 line:95%,end
You started to dive,
and then in the middle

00:35:45.176 --> 00:35:47.311 line:95%,end
you second-guessed yourself
and you went there.

00:35:47.378 --> 00:35:48.746 line:95%,end
You did a front toss.

00:35:48.813 --> 00:35:51.382 line:95%,end
MELISSA: <i>Abby came in</i>

00:35:51.449 --> 00:35:52.383 line:95%,end
Any blood?

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:54.619 line:95%,end
-No, not even a bruise.
-Okay, good.

00:35:54.685 --> 00:35:56.521 line:95%,end
We'll get up and walk around
in just a minute.

00:35:56.587 --> 00:35:57.421 line:95%,end
ABBY: Good.

00:35:57.488 --> 00:36:00.858 line:95%,end
See, if you had a big butt
and you landed on it, it
wouldn't hurt.

00:36:00.925 --> 00:36:02.860 line:95%,end
-MELISSA: Like me.
-(Abby chuckles)

00:36:02.927 --> 00:36:05.763 line:5%,start
Dancers fall and
dancers get hurt.

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:08.866 line:95%,end
<i>This may have been</i>
<i>Maddie's first fall,</i>

00:36:08.933 --> 00:36:11.269 line:95%,end
but it certainly
won't be her last.

00:36:11.335 --> 00:36:16.407 line:95%,end
Sometimes your ego hurts more
than your injury.

00:36:16.474 --> 00:36:18.209 line:95%,end
Oh, look at how sweet.

00:36:18.276 --> 00:36:19.944 line:95%,end
Miss Abby, let me get the door.

Paige, can you get
your hair done, please?

KELLY: My kid, it would have
been like, "Oh, my God, you
embarrass me.

Girls, you pulled through.

Now everybody here at M&amp;A knows
who Abby Lee Dance Company is.

They didn't even know
who I was before.

00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:03.267 line:95%,end
Now, because of your talents
and your mother's costuming,

00:40:03.334 --> 00:40:06.203 line:95%,end
they all know who I am,
and they respect me,

00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:08.873 line:95%,end

how wonderful you were all
behaved,

kids, and what nice moms you

successful trip.

00:40:40.971 --> 00:40:44.775 line:95%,end
There's just one more piece of
business I need to take care of.

<i>I am not going to walk out of</i>

No way.

<i>Jill has a choice to make.</i>

Either she stays and plays by
the Abby League Dance Company
rules

00:40:56.654 --> 00:41:00.224 line:5%,start
or she hits the road
and finds another studio.

00:41:00.291 --> 00:41:03.093 line:5%,start
Jill, I don't want any
more outburst like today.

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:04.528 line:5%,start
You have a big decision to make.

00:41:04.595 --> 00:41:05.663 line:5%,start
Don't take it lightly.

00:41:05.729 --> 00:41:07.231 line:5%,start
Take it very seriously.

00:41:07.298 --> 00:41:08.833 line:5%,start
Will Kendall continue to dance?

00:41:08.899 --> 00:41:10.301 line:5%,start
Will you play on our team?

00:41:10.367 --> 00:41:15.773 line:5%,start
Are you going to do what I say
when I say it or not?

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:17.741 line:5%,start
Well, that's something
Kendall and I will discuss.
