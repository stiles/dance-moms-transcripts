but these people are starting this again,

00:00:10.477 --> 00:00:13.346 line:5%,start
so my kids and I are leaving
and we're not going this weekend.

00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:16.416 line:5%,start

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.122 line:5%,start
and they are causing this trouble.

00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:23.990 line:5%,start

-Okay.

She can't do it.
We have to pull her.

It looks like a stress fracture.

CHRISTI: She'll have the most attention,
the best choreography,

00:00:44.444 --> 00:00:46.079 line:5%,start
and the most private lessons.

Yes.

All right, now Maddie,
you did a solo this week.

ABBY: Nia, I watched the trio

00:01:46.973 --> 00:01:48.475 line:95%,end

At the bottom of the pyramid.

00:02:07.393 --> 00:02:10.563 line:95%,end
Chloe, you were one of the most
advanced dancers

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.199 line:95%,end
sitting in this group
but I want more from you.

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:14.467 line:95%,end
You need a challenge.

00:02:14.534 --> 00:02:16.603 line:95%,end

<i>Chloe is one of my top dancers,</i>

00:02:18.371 --> 00:02:20.140 line:5%,start
and I have something big coming up.

00:02:20.206 --> 00:02:22.142 line:5%,start
So I put her at the bottom of the pyramid

00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:25.111 line:95%,end
because I need to light
a fire under her butt.

00:02:25.178 --> 00:02:29.616 line:95%,end
Remember, there is no I in team,
but there is an M and an E,

00:02:29.682 --> 00:02:30.950 line:95%,end

00:02:31.017 --> 00:02:32.252 line:95%,end
Understood?

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:33.520 line:95%,end
All right, moving on.

00:02:35.021 --> 00:02:36.089 line:95%,end
Nia.

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:38.491 line:95%,end
Nia, that trio, you wanted it.

00:02:38.558 --> 00:02:39.692 line:95%,end
You got in it.

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:42.362 line:95%,end
Like I said,
you have the style and the sass,

00:02:42.428 --> 00:02:44.030 line:95%,end
but the rest of it is a mess.

00:02:45.064 --> 00:02:47.233 line:95%,end
Paige, you did a great job.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.301 line:95%,end
Did your part.

00:02:48.368 --> 00:02:49.369 line:95%,end
I want more.

00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:51.171 line:5%,start
KELLY: Abby says she wants
more from Paige.

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:52.071 line:5%,start
Well, you know what?

00:02:52.138 --> 00:02:53.473 line:5%,start
Paige wants more from Abby.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.708 line:95%,end
<i>She wants to be more</i>
<i>than just a background dancer.</i>

00:02:55.775 --> 00:02:58.845 line:95%,end
Next I have Mackenzie.

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.482 line:95%,end
Mackenzie, you continue
to improve each week.

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.485 line:95%,end
Every week I come into the studio,
you learn a new trick,

00:03:05.552 --> 00:03:08.888 line:95%,end
but I don't want it to all
be about your gymnastics. Got it?

00:03:10.456 --> 00:03:12.859 line:95%,end
And Brooke.

00:03:13.326 --> 00:03:16.262 line:95%,end
I thought that your part
in the group dance was excellent.

00:03:17.897 --> 00:03:20.700 line:95%,end
Just watch the chin in the chin stand.
No more ickies.

00:03:22.235 --> 00:03:25.038 line:95%,end
On top of the pyramid is Maddie.


00:03:25.104 --> 00:03:26.839 line:95%,end
You won the overall high score.

00:03:27.574 --> 00:03:28.841 line:95%,end
You beat Justice.

00:03:28.908 --> 00:03:30.443 line:95%,end
You beat all the boys.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.945 line:95%,end
Congratulations.

00:03:32.011 --> 00:03:33.513 line:95%,end
(applause)

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.148 line:95%,end
Moving on,

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:38.084 line:95%,end
I need to talk
a little bit about this week.

00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:41.688 line:95%,end
There's going to be a scout
from the Joffrey Ballet

00:03:41.754 --> 00:03:43.656 line:95%,end
in Michigan at Energy Dance.

00:03:44.757 --> 00:03:49.495 line:95%,end
He is scouting kids to go
to an audition for Joffrey.

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:51.097 line:95%,end
(girls gasp)

00:03:51.164 --> 00:03:52.966 line:95%,end
-I have family there.
-Wonderful.

00:03:53.032 --> 00:03:55.702 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: The Joffrey is one
of the premiere ballet programs

00:03:55.768 --> 00:03:56.603 line:5%,start
in the country.

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:58.404 line:95%,end
<i>Its reputation is unparalleled.</i>

00:03:58.471 --> 00:04:02.642 line:95%,end
And it really could give one
of them an incredible opportunity.

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.345 line:95%,end
So you need to be your best.

00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:07.747 line:95%,end
You need to represent
the Abby Lee Dance Company

00:04:07.814 --> 00:04:09.249 line:95%,end
to the best of your ability.

00:04:09.315 --> 00:04:10.350 line:95%,end
All right.

00:04:10.416 --> 00:04:13.720 line:95%,end
The group number this week
is entitled "Nip and Tuck."

00:04:14.454 --> 00:04:15.622 line:95%,end
-Hmm.
-We need that.

00:04:15.688 --> 00:04:16.522 line:95%,end
(chuckles)

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:19.292 line:95%,end
I know that you talk
about having some work done.

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:20.360 line:95%,end
Kelly...

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:23.329 line:95%,end
-What?
-ABBY: We all know what you want.

00:04:23.396 --> 00:04:24.330 line:95%,end
Boobs?

00:04:24.397 --> 00:04:26.599 line:95%,end
-(laughter)
-(interposing voices)

00:04:29.168 --> 00:04:32.272 line:95%,end
ABBY: You all know that you have
beautiful, gorgeous children.

00:04:32.338 --> 00:04:35.608 line:95%,end
So this is a message about our body image.

00:04:35.675 --> 00:04:39.946 line:95%,end
It's a message about people
that do have work done.

00:04:40.013 --> 00:04:41.014 line:95%,end
It's kind of eerie.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.448 line:95%,end
It's kind of dark.

00:04:42.515 --> 00:04:45.084 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I think that we're supposed
to be trying to teach our girls

00:04:45.151 --> 00:04:48.688 line:95%,end
to be comfortable in their own skin,
not change that skin,

00:04:48.755 --> 00:04:51.257 line:95%,end
so I'm not sure what kind
of mixed messages we're sending.

00:04:51.858 --> 00:04:53.459 line:95%,end
We have to trios.

00:04:53.526 --> 00:04:55.028 line:95%,end
I'm splitting the group in half.

00:04:55.595 --> 00:05:01.334 line:95%,end
And the trios will be
Mackenzie, Paige, and Nia.

00:05:01.868 --> 00:05:05.038 line:95%,end
You will be doing a high energy
jazz routine,

00:05:05.104 --> 00:05:07.140 line:95%,end
incorporating gymnastic tumbling.

00:05:07.206 --> 00:05:10.143 line:95%,end
KELLY: I think Paige feels
like she's been downgraded.

00:05:10.209 --> 00:05:12.412 line:95%,end
<i>Paige is used to dancing</i>
<i>with Maddie and Chloe.</i>

00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:15.448 line:95%,end
You know,
normally you try to dance ahead,

00:05:15.515 --> 00:05:17.350 line:95%,end
<i>and now Abby's bringing her back a step.</i>

00:05:17.417 --> 00:05:19.619 line:95%,end
Then I have Brooke,
Maddie, and Chloe.

00:05:20.453 --> 00:05:23.289 line:95%,end
You will be doing
a contemporary lyrical routine.

00:05:23.756 --> 00:05:26.359 line:95%,end
Chloe, it's about the trio.

00:05:26.426 --> 00:05:28.761 line:95%,end
CHRISTI:
<i>Nia, Paige, and Mackenzie finally have</i>

00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:30.363 line:95%,end
their special moment, their trio,

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.099 line:95%,end
and I think that they should have a chance
to win on their own.

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:35.601 line:95%,end
<i>Because when you're putting them</i>
<i>against Brooke, Maddie, and Chloe,</i>

00:05:35.668 --> 00:05:37.303 line:95%,end
<i>I mean, it doesn't really seem</i>

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.605 line:95%,end
<i>like that's gonna be</i>
<i>too much of a fair fight.</i>

00:05:39.672 --> 00:05:41.974 line:95%,end
ABBY: Brooke, you've never done
a trio with these girls,

00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:43.476 line:95%,end
so this is gonna be all new for you.

00:05:44.877 --> 00:05:47.213 line:95%,end
Chloe and Maddie
will be doing a solo again.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.982 line:95%,end
MELISSA: <i>I'm happy that Maddie</i>
<i>has a lot of dancers this week,</i>

00:05:50.049 --> 00:05:51.617 line:5%,start
being that the Joffrey is gonna be here,

00:05:51.684 --> 00:05:54.087 line:5%,start
so she has three chances
to be seen on stage.

00:05:54.153 --> 00:05:56.456 line:95%,end
<i>However, it's a lot of pressure</i>
<i>for a nine-year-old.</i>

00:05:56.522 --> 00:05:58.291 line:95%,end
ABBY: I'm excited about going.

00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:00.460 line:95%,end
I had a great time in Chicago.

00:06:00.526 --> 00:06:03.062 line:95%,end
I hope this next trip is just as fun

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:05.498 line:95%,end
without Cathy from Candy Apple.

00:06:06.766 --> 00:06:09.302 line:95%,end
But I'll tell you what,
she's easy to beat.

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:11.070 line:95%,end
The people at this competition

00:06:11.137 --> 00:06:13.039 line:95%,end
aren't gonna be so easy to beat.

00:06:13.106 --> 00:06:15.575 line:95%,end
All right, moms, you can leave.
Thank you very much.

00:06:15.641 --> 00:06:16.976 line:95%,end
Girls, spread apart.

00:06:17.043 --> 00:06:18.444 line:95%,end
We're gonna do an entrance.

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:23.783 line:5%,start
One, two, three, four.

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:27.086 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I don't understand why she was
at the bottom of the pyramid.

00:06:27.153 --> 00:06:27.987 line:95%,end
I don't.

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:30.089 line:95%,end
I think that she deserved
to be in the second row.

00:06:30.156 --> 00:06:32.558 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I don't know how Kenzie
got in the middle, to be honest with you.

00:06:32.625 --> 00:06:34.160 line:95%,end

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:39.599 line:95%,end
Go. Ba bum.

enough time and attention

-Yeah, I agree.

00:06:45.538 --> 00:06:48.441 line:95%,end

00:06:48.508 --> 00:06:49.942 line:95%,end
-MELISSA: That won't happen?

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:51.844 line:95%,end
just slapped together and the fun,

00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:55.681 line:95%,end
contemporary one probably will have--
like, will be a very...

00:06:55.748 --> 00:06:57.517 line:95%,end
-Thoughtful, right.
-...thoughtful piece.

00:06:57.583 --> 00:06:58.818 line:95%,end
And I worry about that.

00:06:58.885 --> 00:07:01.421 line:95%,end
And then when she said that
there's two solos as well,

00:07:01.487 --> 00:07:04.724 line:95%,end
like, there's not enough time
to choreograph five dances in the way

00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:08.694 line:95%,end
that all five of them should
or deserve to be choreographed.

-Why are you getting a boob job?

00:08:19.632 --> 00:08:22.268 line:95%,end
For my 40th birthday,
I thought my husband would get it for me

00:08:22.335 --> 00:08:23.769 line:95%,end
and I thought he would get me my ring.

00:08:23.836 --> 00:08:26.806 line:95%,end
Well, this year I've decided
I'm doing both of them for myself.

00:08:26.873 --> 00:08:30.977 line:95%,end
I want boobs because I think
I need them to balance out my ass.

00:08:31.043 --> 00:08:32.778 line:95%,end
I used to have nice D's.

00:08:32.845 --> 00:08:35.181 line:95%,end
And then I nursed my kids,
all three of my kids,

00:08:35.248 --> 00:08:37.116 line:95%,end
and now I don't have any.
So I told my husband--

00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:39.252 line:95%,end
-Mine was the opposite.
-I lost them because I had kids,

00:08:39.318 --> 00:08:41.787 line:95%,end
so he should reimbursed me.

00:08:41.854 --> 00:08:43.256 line:95%,end

-Yeah.

00:08:46.893 --> 00:08:48.394 line:95%,end
I gave him three beautiful children.

00:08:48.461 --> 00:08:49.695 line:95%,end
He should give me two boobs.

00:08:49.762 --> 00:08:51.531 line:95%,end
And then if I like them,
then I'll get my ass sucked out.

00:08:52.832 --> 00:08:54.300 line:95%,end
I know,
everybody wants me to do my nose

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:56.235 line:95%,end

like a badge of honor.

MELISSA: I don't really think our kids
know what body image really is.

00:08:58.504 --> 00:09:01.440 line:95%,end
I think Brooke does because Abby
tells her all the time she has a big butt,

00:09:01.507 --> 00:09:02.875 line:95%,end
and she constantly throws in her face,

00:09:02.942 --> 00:09:05.144 line:95%,end

You know what I mean?

00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:07.380 line:95%,end

She really has to use
her emotional connection to the audience,

00:12:49.835 --> 00:12:51.170 line:95%,end
and I'm sure she will.

00:12:51.637 --> 00:12:52.772 line:95%,end
Seven. Breathe.

00:12:52.838 --> 00:12:54.240 line:95%,end
Eight. Slow down.

00:12:54.306 --> 00:12:56.342 line:95%,end
One, two, three.

00:12:56.408 --> 00:12:59.845 line:95%,end
<i>I really hope and pray</i>
<i>that this passion that Maddie has</i>

00:12:59.912 --> 00:13:03.382 line:95%,end
<i>for her dancing continues</i>
<i>for the rest of her life.</i>

00:13:03.449 --> 00:13:08.087 line:95%,end
Maddie has this,
and that's what you see first.

00:13:08.154 --> 00:13:13.993 line:95%,end
<i>She loves what she's doing,</i>
<i>and her emotions tell the story,</i>

00:13:14.593 --> 00:13:17.129 line:95%,end
and that's what you fall in love with
when she dances.

00:13:17.196 --> 00:13:20.199 line:95%,end
(music continues playing)

00:13:24.537 --> 00:13:26.539 line:95%,end
-ABBY: Bravo.
-(applause)

00:13:30.276 --> 00:13:33.078 line:95%,end
Good girl.

00:13:33.813 --> 00:13:36.015 line:95%,end
Whoo.

00:13:36.081 --> 00:13:37.683 line:95%,end
You're getting paid.
You get a raise.

00:13:39.351 --> 00:13:40.653 line:95%,end
This is really tears.

00:13:40.719 --> 00:13:42.822 line:5%,start
Da, da, cross.

00:13:42.888 --> 00:13:45.157 line:5%,start
Don't drop off your right heel.

00:13:45.224 --> 00:13:46.826 line:95%,end
That's not how you finish a turn.

00:13:46.892 --> 00:13:48.327 line:95%,end
Chloe has great lines.

00:13:48.394 --> 00:13:49.562 line:95%,end
She's a great dancer.

00:13:49.628 --> 00:13:52.398 line:95%,end
But she doesn't give me what I want.

00:13:52.464 --> 00:13:53.966 line:95%,end
<i>She wants to be a choreographer.</i>

00:13:54.033 --> 00:13:56.902 line:95%,end
<i>She wants to make it up herself</i>
<i>instead of, you know what, kid?</i>

00:13:56.969 --> 00:13:58.771 line:95%,end
There's lots of time for that.

00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:00.539 line:95%,end
Do what I'm telling you to do.

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:02.708 line:95%,end
Up.

00:14:02.775 --> 00:14:04.310 line:95%,end
One, two, three.

00:14:04.376 --> 00:14:05.578 line:95%,end
Arc that way, Chloe.

00:14:05.644 --> 00:14:08.180 line:95%,end
Dance,
don't just be a stick figure.


00:14:08.247 --> 00:14:10.049 line:95%,end
<i>Chloe is just not focused today.</i>

00:14:10.115 --> 00:14:11.917 line:95%,end
She is stumbling over choreography

00:14:11.984 --> 00:14:14.587 line:95%,end
that she should be picking up
like it's second nature.

00:14:14.653 --> 00:14:17.656 line:95%,end
(tense music playing)

00:14:19.925 --> 00:14:22.461 line:95%,end
ABBY: Listen to me.
Go out, get a drink of water.

00:14:22.528 --> 00:14:23.662 line:95%,end
Clear your brain.

00:14:23.729 --> 00:14:25.931 line:95%,end
I decided to give Chloe a little break

00:14:25.998 --> 00:14:27.867 line:95%,end
so that she can gather her thoughts,

00:14:27.933 --> 00:14:30.569 line:95%,end
review her choreography,
and get her act together.

00:14:31.337 --> 00:14:35.274 line:95%,end
In the meantime,
I want Maddie to perform her new solo

00:14:35.341 --> 00:14:37.109 line:95%,end
for my senior company.

00:14:37.576 --> 00:14:40.679 line:95%,end
<i>They need to realize</i>
<i>that a little nine-year-old</i>

00:14:40.746 --> 00:14:41.914 line:95%,end
<i>can learn a whole routine</i>

00:14:41.981 --> 00:14:45.150 line:95%,end
and execute it flawlessly in one day.

00:14:45.217 --> 00:14:47.887 line:95%,end
KELLY: Christi,
she's running Maddie's solo again.

00:14:47.953 --> 00:14:50.556 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: I can't believe Abby
interrupted Chloe's solo rehearsal

00:14:50.623 --> 00:14:51.790 line:95%,end
<i>just so Maddie could perform</i>

00:14:51.857 --> 00:14:53.092 line:95%,end
<i>in front of the senior company.</i>

00:14:53.158 --> 00:14:55.628 line:95%,end
I mean, she's not even trying
to hide her favoritism anymore.

00:14:55.694 --> 00:14:58.330 line:95%,end
It's a slap in the face to everyone,
especially Chloe.

00:14:58.397 --> 00:15:00.933 line:95%,end
It's nice to put all
your eggs in one basket.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:01.834 line:95%,end
Yeah, okay.

00:15:01.901 --> 00:15:04.436 line:95%,end
ABBY: Watch the maturity
in the level of dancing.

00:15:04.937 --> 00:15:07.473 line:95%,end
Watch the ability
to comprehend...

00:15:07.539 --> 00:15:08.908 line:95%,end
the movement.

00:15:08.974 --> 00:15:11.377 line:95%,end
When I've given you
something that I envisioned,

00:15:11.443 --> 00:15:15.314 line:95%,end
and you make it better than
what I ever thought it could be,

00:15:15.381 --> 00:15:17.216 line:95%,end
That's great.
That's amazing.

00:15:17.283 --> 00:15:18.284 line:95%,end
That's what I want to see.

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:21.353 line:95%,end
(contemporary music playing)

00:15:23.722 --> 00:15:27.126 line:95%,end
Abby is trying to turn
our kids against your kid...

00:15:28.727 --> 00:15:30.062 line:95%,end
-You know what--
-...and you let her do it.

00:15:30.129 --> 00:15:30.963 line:95%,end
No, I don't.

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:33.966 line:95%,end
(dramatic music playing)

00:15:40.472 --> 00:15:41.473 line:95%,end
ABBY: She's nine.

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.409 line:95%,end
Some of you are almost twice her age.

00:15:46.412 --> 00:15:48.414 line:95%,end
(applause)

00:15:52.484 --> 00:15:53.752 line:95%,end
ABBY: Go. Go to tap.

00:15:53.819 --> 00:15:55.454 line:95%,end
(indistinct chatter)

00:15:56.388 --> 00:15:58.857 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: She sits there
and she watches the dance.

00:15:58.924 --> 00:16:01.527 line:95%,end
She knows what people's strengths
and weaknesses are,

00:16:02.061 --> 00:16:05.030 line:95%,end
and she uses that as an advantage
for your daughter.

00:16:06.899 --> 00:16:07.900 line:95%,end
(indistinct)

00:16:08.801 --> 00:16:09.802 line:95%,end
Yes.

00:16:09.868 --> 00:16:11.971 line:95%,end
Why don't you ever
stand up to Abby, Melissa?

00:16:12.037 --> 00:16:14.306 line:95%,end
You always say that you're her friend,

00:16:14.373 --> 00:16:17.109 line:95%,end
so you should have a different
kind of a connection with her.

00:16:17.176 --> 00:16:18.978 line:95%,end
So why don't you ever
stick up for the kids?

00:16:19.044 --> 00:16:21.647 line:5%,start
I'm so sick of Christi and Kelly
always getting on me

00:16:21.714 --> 00:16:23.482 line:5%,start
because my daughter has a gift.

00:16:23.549 --> 00:16:26.485 line:95%,end
I'm sick of hearing the whole--the same
thing over and over and over again.

00:16:26.552 --> 00:16:27.987 line:95%,end
I know, but that's the thing.

00:16:28.053 --> 00:16:30.456 line:95%,end
-And we're sick of it happening...
-BOTH: Over and over and over again.

00:16:30.522 --> 00:16:31.857 line:95%,end
I'll go tell Abby--

00:16:31.924 --> 00:16:33.325 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Then she'll have her featured
in the group dance

00:16:33.392 --> 00:16:34.994 line:95%,end
and she'll make sure that
she wins all the solos,

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:36.428 line:95%,end
because she'll have the most attention,

00:16:36.495 --> 00:16:39.732 line:95%,end
the best choreography,
and the most private lessons.

00:16:39.798 --> 00:16:42.401 line:95%,end
Stop about talking about my daughter.
She's nine years old.

00:16:42.468 --> 00:16:43.736 line:95%,end
We're not talking about your daughter.

00:16:43.802 --> 00:16:46.138 line:95%,end
-Yes.
-We're talking what you enable to happen.

00:16:46.205 --> 00:16:47.373 line:95%,end
I'm not talking about your daughter.

00:16:47.439 --> 00:16:48.741 line:95%,end
-I'm talking about you.
-Okay, so you're gonna stick up

00:16:48.807 --> 00:16:50.943 line:95%,end
-for my daughter when Abby's out there?
-I stick up for Maddie all the time.

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:52.745 line:95%,end
I stick up for every one of those kids,
Melissa.

00:16:52.811 --> 00:16:54.813 line:95%,end
-No, you don't.
-Oh, I absolutely do.

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:57.349 line:95%,end
-Melissa, I tell you all the time.
-You know what?

00:16:57.416 --> 00:16:58.851 line:95%,end
Your daughter doesn't need me
to stick up for her

00:16:58.917 --> 00:17:01.653 line:95%,end
because you have her so far
in your back pocket she doesn't need it.

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.255 line:95%,end
I stick up for the kids who need it.

00:17:03.322 --> 00:17:04.890 line:95%,end
I'm just sick and tired of it.

00:17:04.957 --> 00:17:06.225 line:95%,end
I'm not gonna stick around in this room

00:17:06.291 --> 00:17:08.894 line:95%,end
and have Christi and Kelly
bitch at me for no reason.

00:17:08.961 --> 00:17:10.963 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: You see what she does
to my kid and her kid

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.631 line:95%,end
and you don't stick up for them.

00:17:13.365 --> 00:17:15.634 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I am so sick of this. I'm--

00:17:15.701 --> 00:17:18.771 line:95%,end
-I'm gonna sit here.
-CHRISTI: Melissa's in there with Abby?

00:17:19.371 --> 00:17:21.140 line:95%,end
She's going in to tattle on us?

00:17:21.206 --> 00:17:22.908 line:95%,end
You're not allowed to talk
to her till after class.

00:17:22.975 --> 00:17:24.777 line:95%,end
We're having a disagreement with Melissa,

00:17:24.843 --> 00:17:26.979 line:95%,end
and this just goes to show
how close she is with her.

00:17:27.046 --> 00:17:28.047 line:95%,end
She goes in and talks to her.

00:17:28.113 --> 00:17:29.515 line:95%,end
I don't want to dance
here anymore, Maddie.

00:17:29.581 --> 00:17:30.516 line:95%,end
I'm sick of it.

00:17:30.582 --> 00:17:32.985 line:95%,end
-Ever?
-Yeah, I'm sick of it.

00:17:33.052 --> 00:17:34.887 line:95%,end
What--they're always
attacking you and me.

00:17:34.953 --> 00:17:36.288 line:95%,end
I mean, it's ridiculous.

00:17:36.355 --> 00:17:38.690 line:95%,end
It's always about Maddie,
and Maddie, Maddie, Maddie.

00:17:39.425 --> 00:17:41.393 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Hey, Melissa,
we weren't done talking to you.

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:43.062 line:95%,end
Would you mind coming back like an adult

00:17:43.796 --> 00:17:44.830 line:95%,end
instead of hiding by Abby?

00:17:44.897 --> 00:17:46.265 line:95%,end
-MELISSA: I'm not hiding.
-You are hiding.

00:17:46.331 --> 00:17:47.166 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Bite my (bleep).

00:17:47.232 --> 00:17:48.167 line:95%,end
I've had enough.

00:17:48.233 --> 00:17:50.502 line:95%,end
<i>I don't even want to be in the same</i>
<i>building as these women.</i>

00:17:50.569 --> 00:17:52.471 line:95%,end
I don't like it, either,
Melissa, but guess what?

00:17:52.538 --> 00:17:53.539 line:95%,end
This is what it is.

00:17:53.605 --> 00:17:55.407 line:95%,end
MELISSA: <i>I'll make arrangements</i>
<i>for Maddie to get home.</i>

00:17:55.474 --> 00:17:57.810 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: As soon as things get ugly,
you run and go home.

00:17:57.876 --> 00:17:59.078 line:95%,end
MELISSA:
Don't ask me to go back.


00:18:01.647 --> 00:18:04.283 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:18:06.351 --> 00:18:08.020 line:95%,end
I don't know if I'm really that hungry.

00:18:08.087 --> 00:18:09.788 line:95%,end
-Oh, I'm starving.
-HOLLY: Oh, my.

00:18:09.855 --> 00:18:12.024 line:95%,end
-Dance moms are almost always hungry.
-KELLY: I'm starving.

00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:14.159 line:95%,end
I don't want to have
to have a nip and tuck.

00:18:14.226 --> 00:18:15.227 line:95%,end
(laughs)

00:18:15.294 --> 00:18:17.429 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: After the big blow-up
with Melissa last night,

00:18:17.496 --> 00:18:19.465 line:5%,start
Kelly, Holly, and I decided to go
to Mohan's.

00:18:19.531 --> 00:18:21.667 line:95%,end
It's nice to go out with your girlfriends
and blow off steam,

00:18:21.733 --> 00:18:24.036 line:95%,end
you know, especially with people
who you can commiserate with,

00:18:24.103 --> 00:18:25.971 line:95%,end
who understand exactly
where you're coming from.

00:18:26.038 --> 00:18:27.406 line:95%,end
I was just thinking of Abby.

00:18:27.473 --> 00:18:28.440 line:95%,end
What exactly?

00:18:28.507 --> 00:18:31.243 line:95%,end
Like, how she sits up at night
and dreams up all these themes.

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:32.978 line:95%,end
HOLLY:
Well, she was dreaming big this week.

00:18:33.045 --> 00:18:35.981 line:95%,end
(interposing voices)

00:18:36.048 --> 00:18:38.150 line:95%,end
I think she bit off
more than she can chew.

00:18:38.217 --> 00:18:40.586 line:95%,end
The girls work really hard
on those dances,

00:18:40.652 --> 00:18:42.721 line:95%,end
and then someone to get shafted.

00:18:42.788 --> 00:18:43.856 line:95%,end
There's gonna be something.

00:18:43.922 --> 00:18:45.057 line:95%,end
There's gonna be compromise,

00:18:45.124 --> 00:18:46.758 line:95%,end
and it's not gonna be a quality dance,

00:18:46.825 --> 00:18:50.462 line:95%,end
because there is no way she has enough
creative juices in her brain--

00:18:50.529 --> 00:18:52.664 line:95%,end
Well, we already saw the trio.

00:18:52.731 --> 00:18:53.632 line:95%,end
I know.

00:18:53.699 --> 00:18:56.635 line:95%,end
Maybe she's saving
all her creativity for the solos.

00:18:56.702 --> 00:18:59.204 line:5%,start
I try really hard to stay neutral
and objective

00:18:59.271 --> 00:19:02.508 line:5%,start
and stay out of the way,
but I want Nia to do well

00:19:02.574 --> 00:19:03.809 line:95%,end
<i>for the Joffrey Ballet scout,</i>

00:19:03.876 --> 00:19:06.411 line:95%,end
and I just don't think Abby's giving her
enough time or attention.

00:19:06.478 --> 00:19:09.148 line:95%,end
Abby helped Maddie's solo
and Chloe has nothing.

00:19:09.214 --> 00:19:11.316 line:95%,end
Why doesn't she think
about all the other kids?

00:19:11.383 --> 00:19:12.851 line:95%,end
-They don't count.
-I mean, I keep thinking,

00:19:12.918 --> 00:19:14.953 line:95%,end
like, finally someone's gonna
catch a break.

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:16.355 line:95%,end
-It's not right.
-Nope.

00:19:16.421 --> 00:19:17.489 line:95%,end
I feel very defeated.

00:19:17.556 --> 00:19:19.858 line:95%,end
I think Abby spread herself
too thin this week.

00:19:19.925 --> 00:19:22.427 line:95%,end

00:30:01.266 --> 00:30:02.667 line:95%,end
How were my jumps?

00:30:02.734 --> 00:30:03.868 line:95%,end

Your grand jete?

your back foot coming in.

Do you have anything else to say for Nia?

00:30:09.374 --> 00:30:10.742 line:95%,end
No, it was good. I thought it was good.

00:30:10.809 --> 00:30:12.410 line:95%,end

a whole lot of time on stage,

all those judges

of all these competitions
that they go to and listen to them.

00:30:23.488 --> 00:30:27.592 line:95%,end

constructive criticism.

00:30:30.862 --> 00:30:32.297 line:95%,end

type of feedback from Abby.

00:31:09.834 --> 00:31:12.337 line:95%,end
and protect her and fight for her

00:31:12.403 --> 00:31:14.072 line:95%,end

-Remember, it's not about winning, okay?
-Uh-hmm.

00:31:16.975 --> 00:31:20.211 line:95%,end

-Okay.
