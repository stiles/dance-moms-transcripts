ABBY: <i>Previously on </i>Dance Moms...

00:00:02.936 --> 00:00:05.505 line:5%,start
This is the competition that determines

00:00:05.572 --> 00:00:07.474 line:5%,start
who is dancing at Nationals.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.175 line:5%,start
-Do I have a solo?
-ABBY: Toughen up.

00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:11.878 line:5%,start
I have to worry about what's best
for the Abby Lee Dance Company

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:14.514 line:5%,start
And if that means some people not dancing,
that's what it means.

00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:17.050 line:5%,start
-I forgot the whole dance.
-I know. What happened?

00:00:17.117 --> 00:00:18.351 line:5%,start
ABBY: <i>Coming up on</i> Dance Moms...

00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:19.953 line:5%,start
Girls, this is for Nationals.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.423 line:5%,start
The Candy Apple Dance Center
can't wait to beat your ass.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.426 line:5%,start
ABBY: Don't you understand
they should be afraid of you?

00:00:26.493 --> 00:00:28.962 line:5%,start
I was talking about
how my daughter's come 3,000 miles

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.896 line:5%,start
to do three steps.

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:31.664 line:5%,start
ABBY: And be lucky
she's doing those three steps.

00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:33.099 line:5%,start
I can't take it.

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.435 line:95%,end

Get in here.

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:55.388 line:95%,end
Isn't this nice?

00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:58.425 line:95%,end
Lots of space, we can run our numbers.

00:00:58.491 --> 00:00:59.759 line:95%,end
Hello, everybody.

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:01.127 line:95%,end
-Good morning.
-Hello.

00:01:01.194 --> 00:01:03.863 line:95%,end
Intensity Dance was intense.

00:01:04.998 --> 00:01:06.599 line:95%,end
I saw lots of mistakes.

00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:08.234 line:95%,end
And yet this was the week

00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:12.272 line:95%,end
where every solo needed
to strive for perfection.

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:14.841 line:95%,end
This was the last competition

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:16.776 line:95%,end
before we go to Nationals.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.079 line:95%,end
You were duly warned.

00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:22.248 line:95%,end
We won that 2011 National Title.

00:01:22.315 --> 00:01:23.650 line:95%,end
I want to win it again.

00:01:23.716 --> 00:01:25.952 line:95%,end
Now this week,

00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:28.988 line:95%,end
we're going to stay right here
in sunny Los Angeles.

00:01:29.522 --> 00:01:32.892 line:95%,end
But we are going

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:35.428 line:95%,end
to the most famous zip code.

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:37.664 line:95%,end
90210.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:38.932 line:95%,end
Sorry.

00:01:38.998 --> 00:01:40.567 line:95%,end
I'm sorry.

00:01:40.633 --> 00:01:41.534 line:95%,end
I'm sorry.

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:45.171 line:95%,end
We are going to 90210,

00:01:45.238 --> 00:01:46.739 line:95%,end
Beverly Hills.

00:01:46.806 --> 00:01:49.275 line:95%,end

ABBY: We are going to the
Energy Dance National Invitational.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.748 line:5%,start
Several competitions are doing this now,

00:01:55.815 --> 00:01:58.251 line:5%,start
where they invite you
to come to their nationals.

00:01:58.318 --> 00:02:01.221 line:95%,end
So it's very prestigious
and quite an honor to be invited.

00:02:01.287 --> 00:02:02.889 line:95%,end
So let's get to the pyramid.

00:02:04.257 --> 00:02:07.360 line:95%,end
Paige, you know
you were going to be there.

00:02:07.427 --> 00:02:08.495 line:95%,end
You forgot your dance.

00:02:08.561 --> 00:02:12.098 line:95%,end
<i>You have so much more talent</i>
<i>than you're able to show,</i>

00:02:12.165 --> 00:02:15.034 line:95%,end
A, because of an injury
and B because you don't remember

00:02:15.101 --> 00:02:15.969 line:95%,end
what you're doing.

00:02:16.436 --> 00:02:17.437 line:95%,end
Next...

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:21.608 line:95%,end
Nia, I thought you could have been better.

00:02:22.542 --> 00:02:24.444 line:95%,end
<i>I need you to be just as strong at the end</i>

00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:25.812 line:95%,end
<i>as you are at the beginning.</i>

00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:28.381 line:95%,end
Next...

00:02:29.516 --> 00:02:30.783 line:95%,end
I have Chloe.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.054 line:95%,end
ANNOUNCER:<i> 6th place</i>
<i>is Miss Chloe with act number 59, "Ghost."</i>

00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:41.828 line:95%,end
ABBY: Chloe,
you've been consistently in the top 5

00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:42.996 line:95%,end
for most of your life.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.366 line:95%,end
6th is not good enough for you.

00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:50.603 line:95%,end
Kendall, you came out there strong.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:51.671 line:95%,end
You were exciting.

00:02:51.738 --> 00:02:52.906 line:95%,end
<i>You were energized.</i>

00:02:52.972 --> 00:02:54.507 line:95%,end
<i>Your tricks were clean.</i>

00:02:54.574 --> 00:02:55.875 line:95%,end
<i>Your movements were sharp.</i>

00:02:55.942 --> 00:02:57.343 line:95%,end
<i>You attacked them,</i>

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.913 line:95%,end
everything a great jazz dance needs to be.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.615 line:95%,end
When you started your turns,
they were a bit sluggish.

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:04.050 line:95%,end
Even your mother pointed that out to me.

00:03:04.117 --> 00:03:05.451 line:95%,end
JILL: Kendall beat Chloe this week.

00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:06.886 line:5%,start
That's huge.

00:03:06.953 --> 00:03:09.322 line:5%,start
Kendall deserves
to be higher on that pyramid.

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:10.857 line:95%,end
ABBY: Moving along,

00:03:10.924 --> 00:03:11.824 line:95%,end
Brooke.

00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:13.493 line:95%,end
You won.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.094 line:95%,end
You were in the overall high scores.

00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:16.262 line:95%,end
I was proud of you.

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:17.263 line:95%,end
But you know what?

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.632 line:95%,end
You are capable of doing more.

00:03:20.233 --> 00:03:21.901 line:95%,end
And you're lazy.

00:03:21.968 --> 00:03:24.737 line:95%,end
And you're sitting there
saying, this is good.

00:03:24.804 --> 00:03:26.039 line:95%,end
I can coast.

00:03:26.105 --> 00:03:27.140 line:95%,end
I'm still winning.

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:28.575 line:95%,end
I'm still getting the platinum.

00:03:29.442 --> 00:03:31.177 line:95%,end
I can just step out there
and do one chin stand

00:03:31.244 --> 00:03:32.312 line:95%,end
and get a platinum.

00:03:32.378 --> 00:03:33.746 line:95%,end
That's what I see happening.

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:37.584 line:95%,end
Next, Mackenzie...

00:03:38.618 --> 00:03:41.321 line:95%,end
it's the easy stuff that you mess up.

00:03:41.387 --> 00:03:43.156 line:95%,end
<i>The roundoff back handspring was great.</i>

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:45.825 line:95%,end
<i>The side aerial was great.</i>
<i>aerial walkover was great.</i>

00:03:45.892 --> 00:03:46.893 line:95%,end
<i>This?</i>

00:03:47.961 --> 00:03:48.861 line:95%,end
Come on.

00:03:49.862 --> 00:03:53.700 line:95%,end
And Maddie, you're on top of the pyramid.

00:03:54.367 --> 00:03:56.102 line:95%,end
-Are you glad to be there?
-Yes.

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:59.372 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: Abby's already defined Maddie
as her National winner.

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:00.640 line:95%,end
ABBY: Was it better to win,

00:04:00.707 --> 00:04:01.741 line:95%,end
or better to sit in the audience,

00:04:01.808 --> 00:04:03.376 line:95%,end
while everybody else gets better?

00:04:03.443 --> 00:04:04.877 line:95%,end
It's better to win.

00:04:04.944 --> 00:04:07.747 line:95%,end
Maddie is on top
of the pyramid, of course.

00:04:07.814 --> 00:04:10.016 line:95%,end
Her performance alone put her there.

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:13.119 line:95%,end
Now everyone is in the group routine.

00:04:13.186 --> 00:04:15.788 line:95%,end
And this group routine is very disturbing.

00:04:16.522 --> 00:04:19.826 line:95%,end
And the title is "My Last Text."

00:04:20.526 --> 00:04:24.497 line:95%,end
This routine should leave
the judges feeling something.

00:04:24.964 --> 00:04:27.734 line:5%,start
This week, we're doing
a group number called "My Last Text."

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.370 line:95%,end
And it's really weird and scary.

00:04:30.436 --> 00:04:32.939 line:95%,end
ABBY: Energy Dance is allowing us

00:04:33.006 --> 00:04:35.041 line:95%,end
to do four additional routines.

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:37.810 line:95%,end
Mackenzie, you're doing a solo this week.

00:04:38.344 --> 00:04:40.546 line:95%,end
Maddie, you will have a solo

00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:42.215 line:95%,end
because you just won the overall.


00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:46.452 line:95%,end
Brooke, you will be doing
"The Diary of Anne Frank."

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:49.088 line:95%,end
Paige, you will not have a solo this week.

00:04:49.155 --> 00:04:51.057 line:95%,end
I want you to concentrate
on the group dance.

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:52.525 line:95%,end
And I want you to remember it.

00:04:52.592 --> 00:04:54.927 line:95%,end
Nia, Kendall, and Chloe,

00:04:54.994 --> 00:04:56.896 line:95%,end
we're going to teach all three of you

00:04:57.664 --> 00:04:59.132 line:95%,end
the same choreography.

00:04:59.866 --> 00:05:03.770 line:95%,end
<i>Originally, I thought that Chloe</i>
<i>would be my fourth solo selected.</i>

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:06.606 line:95%,end
But after she ended up sixth

00:05:06.673 --> 00:05:07.940 line:95%,end
and Kendall beat her

00:05:08.007 --> 00:05:10.276 line:95%,end
<i>and Nia looked great in the group dance,</i>

00:05:12.178 --> 00:05:14.113 line:95%,end
I don't know
if Chloe's the right choice, or not.

00:05:15.715 --> 00:05:19.085 line:95%,end
So you three, get your game faces on.

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:22.422 line:95%,end
And remember, they're not your friends.

00:05:22.488 --> 00:05:23.423 line:95%,end
They're your competitors.

00:05:24.123 --> 00:05:25.425 line:95%,end
JILL: <i>Abby gives out the solos.</i>

00:05:25.491 --> 00:05:27.560 line:95%,end
She has one solo left to give out.

00:05:27.627 --> 00:05:30.229 line:95%,end
And the three of them
are going to have to compete

00:05:30.296 --> 00:05:31.864 line:95%,end
for this final solo position.

00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:34.901 line:95%,end
I think this is ridiculous and unfair.

00:05:34.967 --> 00:05:38.037 line:95%,end
I really, really want
for Kendall to have a solo.

00:05:38.104 --> 00:05:39.038 line:95%,end
She deserves it.

00:05:40.606 --> 00:05:41.641 line:95%,end
Moms, you are dismissed.

00:05:41.708 --> 00:05:43.142 line:95%,end
Girls spread apart,

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:45.011 line:95%,end
grand pliÃ© in Second,

00:05:45.078 --> 00:05:46.979 line:95%,end
heel stretch in front.

00:05:51.951 --> 00:05:53.653 line:5%,start
So here's a car seat.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.289 line:5%,start
Okay, Maddie, get in
the passenger seat right there.

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:59.292 line:5%,start
<i>This number is called "The Last Text."</i>

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:00.560 line:95%,end
<i>I have this vision.</i>

00:06:00.626 --> 00:06:01.994 line:95%,end
<i>We're going to put the kids in the car,</i>

00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:04.163 line:95%,end
<i>even though they're really</i>
<i>a little young to be driving.</i>

00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:05.832 line:95%,end
Now you're in a car.

00:06:05.898 --> 00:06:09.369 line:95%,end
So when she turns, everybody--
everybody has to lean.

00:06:09.435 --> 00:06:10.503 line:95%,end
(laughs)

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.305 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>I'm going to use Paige</i>
<i>as the driver.</i>

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:13.940 line:95%,end
<i>She doesn't have to do too much.</i>

00:06:14.006 --> 00:06:15.675 line:95%,end
Kelly will probably hit the roof.

00:06:15.742 --> 00:06:17.543 line:95%,end
But Paige is beautiful to look at.

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:18.544 line:95%,end
<i>They're on their phones.</i>

00:06:18.611 --> 00:06:20.346 line:95%,end
<i>And they're taking pictures of each other.</i>

00:06:20.413 --> 00:06:21.314 line:95%,end
<i>That's what little kids do.</i>

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:23.716 line:95%,end
And then in the music, boom.

00:06:23.783 --> 00:06:24.884 line:95%,end
There's a car crash.

00:06:24.951 --> 00:06:27.954 line:95%,end
On each tink, they're not hearing this.

00:06:30.123 --> 00:06:33.726 line:95%,end
<i>If Maddie can pull this number</i>
<i>of with her acting skills,</i>

00:06:33.793 --> 00:06:34.961 line:95%,end
it's going to win.

00:06:35.027 --> 00:06:36.195 line:95%,end
It's going to win everything.

00:06:36.262 --> 00:06:39.098 line:95%,end
Paige, for God's sakes,
you haven't even danced yet.

00:06:39.165 --> 00:06:40.333 line:95%,end
Sit up straight.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.102 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I think having
Nia and Chloe and Kendall

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:46.472 line:95%,end
dance against one another
for a solo is crappy.

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:48.441 line:95%,end
Naturally, all the kids want it.

00:06:48.508 --> 00:06:50.410 line:95%,end
And you have to beat
your friend to get it.

00:06:50.476 --> 00:06:52.378 line:95%,end
HOLLY: My thought is that
I think it's ridiculous

00:06:52.445 --> 00:06:55.815 line:95%,end
that she already
has someone picked for that solo.

00:06:55.882 --> 00:06:58.785 line:95%,end
And I'm pretty confident

00:06:58.851 --> 00:07:01.120 line:95%,end
Abby doesn't want Nia to do that solo.

00:07:01.187 --> 00:07:04.724 line:95%,end
Push, two, three, four.

00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:07.693 line:95%,end
Now grab her
and pull her away from her, away.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.863 line:95%,end
JILL: Last week, she made it
crystal clear to all of us.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.900 line:95%,end
What you do this week--
that's why she gave everybody a solo--

00:07:13.966 --> 00:07:15.768 line:95%,end
is who gets what at Nationals.

00:07:15.835 --> 00:07:18.938 line:95%,end
Everybody who came in
score wise got a solo,

00:07:19.005 --> 00:07:20.339 line:95%,end
except for Kendall.

00:07:20.406 --> 00:07:21.407 line:95%,end
ABBY: Front.

00:07:21.974 --> 00:07:23.543 line:95%,end
So how I see it is--

00:07:23.609 --> 00:07:24.911 line:95%,end
KELLY: She's giving Chloe another chance.

00:07:24.977 --> 00:07:26.012 line:95%,end
Yep. She's giving it to Chloe.

00:07:26.078 --> 00:07:28.681 line:95%,end
But that's (bleep). Kendall beat Chloe.

00:07:28.748 --> 00:07:30.917 line:95%,end
It was Kendall's week.
So give it to her, then.

00:07:30.983 --> 00:07:32.452 line:95%,end
I'm worried your three kids

00:07:32.518 --> 00:07:34.320 line:95%,end
are going to be not focused now.

00:07:34.387 --> 00:07:36.522 line:95%,end
Because they're doing
a group dance right now.

00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:38.324 line:95%,end
And they're going
to be worried, oh, my God, oh, my God.

00:07:38.391 --> 00:07:40.526 line:95%,end
I have to compete
against my friends to get a solo.

00:07:40.593 --> 00:07:43.529 line:95%,end
But I also wonder
if that is another motivating factor

00:07:43.596 --> 00:07:45.364 line:95%,end
to try to teach those kids,
you need to want it.

00:07:45.431 --> 00:07:48.367 line:95%,end
But that's just not in Chloe's nature.

00:07:48.434 --> 00:07:49.435 line:95%,end
ABBY: Were you?

00:07:49.502 --> 00:07:51.504 line:95%,end
Did you almost--who
almost tripped over her?

00:07:51.571 --> 00:07:53.473 line:95%,end
All right. Guys, go grab a drink.

00:07:53.539 --> 00:07:55.341 line:95%,end
JILL: Vivi got a lot of solos.

00:07:55.408 --> 00:07:56.642 line:95%,end
MADDIE: Oh, my gosh!

00:07:56.709 --> 00:07:59.946 line:95%,end
(interposing voices)

00:08:00.012 --> 00:08:01.247 line:95%,end
Never text and drive.

00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:02.982 line:95%,end
This dance is so creepy.

00:08:03.049 --> 00:08:04.717 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: So the mom's and I
are all sitting outside.

00:08:04.784 --> 00:08:06.519 line:95%,end
And all of a sudden,
the girls burst through the door.

00:08:06.586 --> 00:08:08.221 line:95%,end
And everybody's,
like, freaked out a little bit.

00:08:08.287 --> 00:08:09.856 line:95%,end
And they're like,
oh, the music's really creepy.

00:08:09.922 --> 00:08:11.624 line:95%,end
And Mackenzie gets ejected from the car.

00:08:11.691 --> 00:08:13.759 line:95%,end
And I'm thinking, like,
what the hell kind of dance is this?

00:08:13.826 --> 00:08:16.596 line:95%,end
So like, we're all,
like, dying throughout the dance.

00:08:17.597 --> 00:08:19.565 line:95%,end
JILL: Who's texting? Who's the culprit?

00:08:19.632 --> 00:08:20.633 line:95%,end
-We all are.
-No.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.068 line:95%,end
-Paige dies first.
-JILL: Who's driving?

00:08:22.134 --> 00:08:23.069 line:95%,end
-Paige.
-PAIGE: I don't dance at all.

00:08:23.135 --> 00:08:24.070 line:95%,end
Chloe takes pictures of me.

00:08:24.136 --> 00:08:25.037 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: What do you mean,
you don't dance?

00:08:25.104 --> 00:08:26.672 line:95%,end
-She sits like this the whole time.
-No.

00:08:26.739 --> 00:08:28.541 line:95%,end
HOLLY: What do you mean?
You don't stand up?

00:08:28.608 --> 00:08:30.776 line:95%,end
I sit like this the whole time.

00:08:32.979 --> 00:08:34.113 line:95%,end
Doing what?

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.314 line:95%,end
Just ignore her, Paige.

00:08:35.381 --> 00:08:37.783 line:95%,end
She's just doing it to be a mean person.

00:08:45.725 --> 00:08:47.593 line:5%,start
Oh, my God!

00:08:48.027 --> 00:08:49.462 line:95%,end

ALL: No!

00:08:59.805 --> 00:09:01.974 line:5%,start
Gianna gets a tweet from Cathy,

00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:04.677 line:5%,start
saying, like, the Candy Apples
are on their way to Nationals

00:09:04.744 --> 00:09:06.445 line:95%,end
to kick the ALDC's ass.

00:09:06.512 --> 00:09:08.381 line:95%,end
<i>This is a whole new ball game.</i>

00:09:09.749 --> 00:09:11.017 line:95%,end
They're going to be hungry for it, though.

00:09:11.083 --> 00:09:14.086 line:95%,end
I know. And they've probably been
working on this dance

00:09:14.153 --> 00:09:15.721 line:95%,end
-for, like, how long?
-Months.

00:09:15.788 --> 00:09:16.756 line:95%,end
And we're learning ours in two days.

00:09:16.822 --> 00:09:19.859 line:5%,start
I think knowing that
the Candy Apples are going to be here,

00:09:19.926 --> 00:09:21.761 line:5%,start
Abby is going to push the girls more.

00:09:21.827 --> 00:09:24.263 line:95%,end
<i>So all the girls</i>

00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:38.744 line:5%,start
It's music I've used before.

SINGER: <i>âª Ain't no honey sweeter</i>

00:09:42.748 --> 00:09:44.517 line:95%,end
It's called "Honey Bee."

00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:47.720 line:95%,end
But I think Mackenzie
is more of a killer bee.

00:09:48.955 --> 00:09:50.489 line:95%,end
Beautiful.

00:09:50.556 --> 00:09:53.459 line:95%,end
<i>She's going to go out there</i>

00:09:53.526 --> 00:09:55.494 line:95%,end
If Vivi-Anne happens to be
waiting in the wings

00:09:55.561 --> 00:09:58.064 line:95%,end

Now Brooke learned this routine
about four weeks ago.

00:10:11.677 --> 00:10:13.546 line:95%,end
So she should have it down pat.

00:10:15.147 --> 00:10:17.583 line:95%,end

<i>She's going to be beautiful.</i>

00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:21.854 line:95%,end
And she's going to nail it,

00:10:21.921 --> 00:10:23.356 line:95%,end
or she's going to be sloppy

00:10:23.422 --> 00:10:24.590 line:95%,end
and she's not going to win.

00:10:25.224 --> 00:10:26.659 line:95%,end
It's up to Brooke.

00:10:26.726 --> 00:10:28.561 line:95%,end
You have to realize

00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:31.130 line:95%,end
that nobody from Cathy's

00:10:31.197 --> 00:10:32.832 line:95%,end
is going to come close to you.

00:10:32.898 --> 00:10:35.267 line:95%,end
If you do this dance
the way I taught it to you,

00:10:35.334 --> 00:10:36.736 line:95%,end
you're going to win.

00:10:36.802 --> 00:10:40.673 line:95%,end
She has everything required

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:44.310 line:5%,start
Hold, boom, run, run, run,

00:10:44.377 --> 00:10:46.278 line:95%,end

Yes. Yeah.

When Maddie's getting
better by doing this,

Paige has been sitting here
for two days doing nothing.

00:11:16.976 --> 00:11:18.244 line:95%,end
I know. But the other girls
were dancing, too.

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:19.812 line:95%,end
-They're not sitting in a seat.
-There's a turn.

00:11:19.879 --> 00:11:21.080 line:95%,end
Is there a turn right there?

00:11:21.147 --> 00:11:24.116 line:95%,end
I think it's hard to dance
when others are ripping on you

00:11:24.183 --> 00:11:26.185 line:95%,end
right in front of your face.

00:11:27.586 --> 00:11:28.954 line:95%,end
Who's ripping on her?

00:11:29.021 --> 00:11:30.589 line:95%,end
We didn't say anything about Maddie.

KELLY: And Abby, by the way,
I was not talking about Maddie.

00:11:33.225 --> 00:11:35.761 line:95%,end

to do three steps.

00:11:36.762 --> 00:11:38.731 line:95%,end
ABBY: And be lucky
she's doing those three steps!

00:11:39.265 --> 00:11:40.099 line:95%,end
Why?

00:11:40.166 --> 00:11:42.268 line:95%,end
ABBY: After she forgot
and screwed up her dance

00:11:42.334 --> 00:11:44.870 line:95%,end
and didn't do it
and forgot again a 11 years old?

00:11:44.937 --> 00:11:46.072 line:95%,end
What?

00:11:46.138 --> 00:11:47.673 line:95%,end
I'd get back to the pediatrician

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.241 line:95%,end
and find out what's wrong, Kelly.

00:11:49.308 --> 00:11:51.010 line:95%,end
For real, find out what's wrong.

00:11:51.844 --> 00:11:52.978 line:95%,end
Go.

00:11:55.881 --> 00:11:56.749 line:95%,end
Let's go, Paige.

You need to figure some new tricks.

00:12:03.489 --> 00:12:05.157 line:95%,end
Because this whole little temper tantrum

00:12:05.224 --> 00:12:08.461 line:95%,end

We know exactly what you're thinking.

00:12:25.544 --> 00:12:26.912 line:95%,end
You're thinking
you're the world's worst mother

00:12:26.979 --> 00:12:28.681 line:95%,end
because you're allowed this to happen.

00:12:28.748 --> 00:12:31.984 line:95%,end

for Nationals this entire time

00:12:34.453 --> 00:12:36.322 line:95%,end

That's fine. They can do it.

00:13:07.586 --> 00:13:10.156 line:95%,end
But I can't do this anymore.

00:13:10.222 --> 00:13:12.324 line:95%,end
<i>This is just one more reason</i>

00:13:12.391 --> 00:13:15.361 line:5%,start
why I think I need
to pull my kids out of this studio.

00:13:17.663 --> 00:13:20.900 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)


00:13:25.538 --> 00:13:27.206 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>We walk into rehearsals</i>
<i>this morning</i>

00:13:27.273 --> 00:13:29.208 line:95%,end
<i>and Kelly is nowhere to be found.</i>

00:13:29.842 --> 00:13:30.876 line:95%,end
If Kelly doesn't come back,

00:13:30.943 --> 00:13:32.778 line:95%,end
Abby can feel free to replace me too.

00:13:32.845 --> 00:13:34.580 line:95%,end
Because you know what?
We're a two-for-one.

00:13:35.181 --> 00:13:36.782 line:95%,end
<i>No Kelly, no Christi.</i>

00:13:36.849 --> 00:13:38.818 line:95%,end
Because I'm not putting up
with these people alone.

00:13:38.884 --> 00:13:40.953 line:95%,end
-Hey!
-Hi!

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:43.389 line:95%,end
Look what the cat dragged in.

00:13:43.455 --> 00:13:45.224 line:95%,end
The party is here.

00:13:46.859 --> 00:13:48.093 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>I talked to my kids.</i>

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.396 line:95%,end
And they want to go back to practice.

00:13:50.462 --> 00:13:52.198 line:95%,end
<i>They really want to do Nationals.</i>

00:13:52.264 --> 00:13:54.567 line:95%,end
<i>So I'm going to toughen up.</i>

00:13:54.633 --> 00:13:55.935 line:95%,end
And we're going to finish out the year.

00:13:56.001 --> 00:13:57.136 line:95%,end
How are you going to react to Abby,

00:13:57.203 --> 00:13:59.004 line:95%,end
-once you see her?
-I don't know. I'm nervous.

00:13:59.071 --> 00:14:00.406 line:95%,end
So you haven't talked to her at all?

00:14:02.074 --> 00:14:04.410 line:95%,end
You know, I know her comment's
going to be, well, you left.

00:14:04.476 --> 00:14:06.245 line:95%,end
But I keep leaving

00:14:06.312 --> 00:14:08.781 line:95%,end
because she keeps doing things
to make me leave.

00:14:08.848 --> 00:14:11.717 line:95%,end
Like, what am I supposed to do,
just sit there and, like, take it?

00:14:12.384 --> 00:14:13.752 line:95%,end
Hello.

00:14:15.588 --> 00:14:18.424 line:95%,end
I need all of you.
We're going to do the solo audition final.

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:19.558 line:95%,end
(tense music playing)

00:14:19.625 --> 00:14:20.926 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>I'm going to have an audition.</i>

00:14:20.993 --> 00:14:24.496 line:95%,end
<i>But Holly, Christi,</i>
<i>and Jill will be judging.</i>

00:14:24.563 --> 00:14:26.966 line:95%,end
So the girls are actually
going to audition

00:14:27.032 --> 00:14:28.167 line:95%,end
for their own mothers.

00:14:28.234 --> 00:14:32.738 line:5%,start
SINGER: <i>âª I love only silence here âª</i>

00:14:33.205 --> 00:14:35.574 line:5%,start
<i>âª There is noise all the time âª</i>

00:14:37.276 --> 00:14:40.646 line:95%,end
<i>âª I love sunny landscapes âª</i>

00:14:40.713 --> 00:14:44.750 line:95%,end
<i>âª I love the sky âª</i>

00:14:44.817 --> 00:14:46.552 line:95%,end
HOLLY: <i>Abby maintains</i>
<i>that the moms will decide</i>

00:14:46.619 --> 00:14:47.620 line:95%,end
<i>who gets the fourth solo.</i>

00:14:47.686 --> 00:14:50.856 line:95%,end
But we all know
who has the final decision,

00:14:50.923 --> 00:14:53.692 line:95%,end
<i>when it comes to any dancing</i>
<i>at the Abby Lee Dance Company.</i>

00:14:53.759 --> 00:14:58.464 line:95%,end
SINGER: <i>âª The great woman who will save âª</i>

00:14:58.530 --> 00:14:59.365 line:95%,end
ABBY: Okay.

00:14:59.431 --> 00:15:01.767 line:95%,end
We're going to start with Jill.

00:15:02.268 --> 00:15:03.569 line:95%,end
I pick Kendall.

00:15:03.636 --> 00:15:05.304 line:95%,end
-I'm sorry. To me, a no-brainer.
-ABBY: Christi.

00:15:05.938 --> 00:15:07.306 line:95%,end
I obviously pick Chloe.

00:15:07.373 --> 00:15:09.441 line:95%,end
She's been with you
since she was two years old.

00:15:09.508 --> 00:15:13.679 line:95%,end
I think Chloe has been
a team player for a long time.

00:15:13.746 --> 00:15:14.680 line:95%,end
Holly?

00:15:14.747 --> 00:15:16.515 line:95%,end
I would say Nia.

00:15:16.582 --> 00:15:20.052 line:95%,end
I really enjoyed watching
her perform the piece.

00:15:20.119 --> 00:15:22.388 line:95%,end
All right. So we have a three-way tie.

00:15:22.454 --> 00:15:24.189 line:95%,end
JILL: <i>This is a big waste of time.</i>

00:15:24.256 --> 00:15:26.358 line:5%,start
Because ultimately, we all know

00:15:26.425 --> 00:15:28.494 line:5%,start
that Abby's going to pick who
gets the solo.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.663 line:95%,end
So Melissa, you get to break the tie.

00:15:30.729 --> 00:15:32.231 line:95%,end
Oh, my God.

00:15:34.366 --> 00:15:35.935 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>I put Melissa on the spot.</i>

00:15:36.001 --> 00:15:38.971 line:95%,end
Because I am sick and tired
of her being goody-goody

00:15:39.038 --> 00:15:40.873 line:95%,end
and playing sides to everybody.

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.808 line:95%,end
<i>She's this one's best friend one day</i>

00:15:42.875 --> 00:15:45.444 line:95%,end
<i>and this one's best friend the next day,</i>
<i>talking about that one.</i>

00:15:45.511 --> 00:15:46.645 line:95%,end
That's what she does.

00:15:48.047 --> 00:15:51.183 line:95%,end
I think that Nia
should get this opportunity

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:54.320 line:95%,end
because she goes 100%.

00:15:54.386 --> 00:15:58.290 line:95%,end
And she has shown us
that she can do different.

00:15:59.792 --> 00:16:02.594 line:95%,end
Based on that performance,
you would put Nia on that stage?

00:16:02.661 --> 00:16:05.064 line:95%,end
-And I'm not saying you wouldn't.
-I'm not a judge. I'm a mom.

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.299 line:95%,end
You asked us to base it
on that performance.

00:16:07.366 --> 00:16:10.035 line:95%,end
HOLLY: But she gave her opinion, so rest.

00:16:10.102 --> 00:16:11.770 line:95%,end
I'm sorry if that hurt your feelings.

00:16:11.837 --> 00:16:13.372 line:95%,end
-HOLLY: No, it doesn't hurt my feelings.
-JILL: I didn't want to know

00:16:13.439 --> 00:16:14.340 line:95%,end
about all the weeks

00:16:14.406 --> 00:16:15.441 line:95%,end
-she worked in the past.
-Silence.

00:16:15.507 --> 00:16:18.110 line:95%,end
JILL: <i>I think this is ridiculous</i>
<i>and unfair.</i>

00:16:18.177 --> 00:16:20.045 line:95%,end
Kendall beat Chloe fair and square.

00:16:20.112 --> 00:16:21.780 line:95%,end
<i>Kendall deserves the solo.</i>

00:16:22.214 --> 00:16:24.917 line:95%,end
Melissa, all personal issues aside,

00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:26.251 line:95%,end
who do you think

00:16:26.318 --> 00:16:29.188 line:95%,end
is going to give us the most points?

00:16:29.655 --> 00:16:31.056 line:95%,end
-And that's what a judge needs to do.
-Chloe.

00:16:31.123 --> 00:16:32.624 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I just said it.
And I'm not saying it again.

00:16:32.691 --> 00:16:33.759 line:95%,end
Because I don't want to hurt
anybody's feelings.

00:16:33.826 --> 00:16:35.828 line:95%,end
It's already done, Melissa.
We already knew.

00:16:35.894 --> 00:16:37.029 line:95%,end
Kendall, I think you were wonderful.

00:16:37.096 --> 00:16:38.430 line:95%,end
I do. I think you were great.

00:16:38.497 --> 00:16:40.532 line:95%,end
Well, I already knew
who was going to get it.

00:16:40.599 --> 00:16:41.467 line:95%,end
Of course we knew.

00:16:41.533 --> 00:16:43.035 line:95%,end
Because you wanted her to beat me.

00:16:43.102 --> 00:16:44.837 line:95%,end
JILL: This whole thing It's not fair.

00:16:44.903 --> 00:16:46.972 line:95%,end
It's not fair. It's just not fair.

00:16:47.039 --> 00:16:48.407 line:95%,end
Oh, my gosh.

00:16:49.041 --> 00:16:50.976 line:95%,end
It's a solo, Jill.

00:16:51.043 --> 00:16:51.977 line:95%,end
-Relax.
-JILL: That's right.

00:16:52.044 --> 00:16:53.012 line:95%,end
You relax, Holly.

00:16:53.078 --> 00:16:54.013 line:95%,end
Then relax.

00:16:54.079 --> 00:16:55.748 line:95%,end
I'm not dealing with this anymore.

00:16:55.814 --> 00:16:58.584 line:95%,end
This is ludicrous, absolutely ludicrous.

00:17:03.322 --> 00:17:04.556 line:95%,end
ABBY: You know what, Kendall?

00:17:04.623 --> 00:17:05.624 line:95%,end
You don't have to worry about it.

00:17:05.691 --> 00:17:08.861 line:95%,end
I would love for you to go and beat
the crap out of Candy Apples.

00:17:08.927 --> 00:17:10.529 line:95%,end
I'm not allowed to do any more solos.

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:12.965 line:95%,end
-KENDALL: Thank you.
-You're welcome.

00:17:13.032 --> 00:17:14.033 line:95%,end
CHLOE: Good job, Kendall.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:15.834 line:95%,end
ABBY: Congratulations.

00:17:15.901 --> 00:17:17.169 line:95%,end
Thank you.


00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:21.340 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:17:25.511 --> 00:17:27.046 line:95%,end
ABBY: Hello, everybody.

00:17:27.613 --> 00:17:29.181 line:5%,start
Why does everybody keep warming up?

00:17:29.248 --> 00:17:31.083 line:5%,start
It's just going to be a long day.

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:34.253 line:5%,start
This is the last day of the rehearsal.

00:17:34.319 --> 00:17:35.454 line:95%,end
<i>I don't want to be cocky.</i>

00:17:35.521 --> 00:17:37.990 line:95%,end
<i>There's a lot of people</i>
<i>coming to this competition.</i>

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:42.561 line:95%,end
<i>Some really, really tough schools</i>
<i>in the California area have been invited.</i>

00:17:43.062 --> 00:17:46.298 line:95%,end
And I know that I always
have a target on my back.

00:17:46.365 --> 00:17:48.300 line:5%,start
I don't want any excuses.

00:17:48.367 --> 00:17:50.169 line:5%,start
Nobody's forgetting and running off.

00:17:50.235 --> 00:17:51.970 line:95%,end
CHLOE: <i>My new solo is called "Silence."</i>

00:17:52.037 --> 00:17:54.773 line:95%,end
<i>And it has a lot of emotions</i>
<i>and I really like it.</i>

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:58.177 line:5%,start
I'm going to work the hardest
that I've ever worked on a solo before.

00:17:58.243 --> 00:18:00.779 line:95%,end
Because I really want
to make Nia and Kendall proud,

00:18:00.846 --> 00:18:02.781 line:95%,end
since they didn't get their opportunity.

00:18:04.116 --> 00:18:05.684 line:95%,end
ABBY: Okay, breathe.

00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:07.586 line:95%,end
-Listen to her breathing.
-ABBY: Breathe.

00:18:09.188 --> 00:18:11.590 line:95%,end
You okay? You got to breathe.

00:18:11.657 --> 00:18:13.892 line:95%,end
You're not breathing the whole time.
And there's breaths in there.

00:18:13.959 --> 00:18:15.727 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>I don't think Chloe</i>
<i>is going into Nationals</i>

00:18:15.794 --> 00:18:18.030 line:95%,end
<i>with the confidence that she should have.</i>

00:18:18.897 --> 00:18:20.766 line:95%,end
<i>I mean, Chloe got sixth last week.</i>

00:18:20.833 --> 00:18:22.634 line:5%,start
And to be beat by Kendall, I think,

00:18:22.701 --> 00:18:25.304 line:5%,start
was a little bit of a blow to her
confidence.

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:28.107 line:95%,end
<i>I'm always the first to hug her</i>
<i>and say, oh, you know, it doesn't matter.</i>

00:18:28.173 --> 00:18:30.142 line:95%,end
But I want her to do great at Nationals.

00:18:30.209 --> 00:18:34.146 line:95%,end
So maybe it's time that I push her
a little more than just coddle her.

00:18:34.213 --> 00:18:37.616 line:95%,end
Honey, you learned
that dance yesterday, okay?

00:18:37.683 --> 00:18:41.453 line:95%,end
And the difference between
what you did yesterday and today

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:43.122 line:95%,end
is amazing.

00:18:43.188 --> 00:18:44.723 line:95%,end
You are not messing up everything.

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:46.291 line:95%,end
-Okay?
-Uh-hmm.

00:18:46.358 --> 00:18:48.727 line:95%,end
Like, I know that you could go
do that dance, Chloe.

00:18:48.794 --> 00:18:50.095 line:95%,end
I know you can.

00:18:50.162 --> 00:18:51.430 line:95%,end
I know you can.

00:18:52.564 --> 00:18:53.999 line:95%,end
It doesn't matter what I know.

00:18:54.633 --> 00:18:56.201 line:95%,end
You have to know it.

00:18:56.268 --> 00:18:57.503 line:95%,end
Okay?

00:18:57.569 --> 00:19:00.873 line:95%,end

It's a little under our budget.

This is a wonderful opportunity.

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.948 line:5%,start
We're here in LA.

Oh, there's people in here...

MACKENZIE: Oh, my God, Cathy.

Oh, my God.

00:19:26.665 --> 00:19:29.368 line:95%,end
What the heck?
Are they test crash dummies?

Ew. Okay. Well, you know what, guys?

-Yeah.

Don't you understand
they should be afraid of you?

00:19:52.891 --> 00:19:54.660 line:95%,end
CATHY: Yeah.
Since this is all about him and Chloe--

00:19:54.726 --> 00:19:56.061 line:95%,end

Clean Chloe's clock.

00:19:59.431 --> 00:20:01.033 line:95%,end
Clean Chloe's clock.

00:20:01.099 --> 00:20:02.534 line:95%,end
ABBY: Time to get ready, solos.

00:20:02.601 --> 00:20:03.602 line:95%,end
Let's do it.

00:20:03.669 --> 00:20:04.836 line:95%,end
Just to let you guys know,

00:20:04.903 --> 00:20:06.805 line:95%,end
I was just in the bathroom
getting a drink.

00:20:06.872 --> 00:20:08.340 line:95%,end
and they're out there,

00:20:08.874 --> 00:20:10.008 line:95%,end
chanting...

00:20:10.075 --> 00:20:12.411 line:95%,end

CHRISTI: Oh, give me a break, please.

00:20:14.646 --> 00:20:16.615 line:95%,end
Okay, Justice, what are you
supposed to look like?

00:20:16.682 --> 00:20:18.917 line:95%,end
You are telling a story, also.

00:20:18.984 --> 00:20:21.820 line:95%,end
ABBY: Go out there and beat Justice.

ABBY: Girls, listen to me.

00:20:26.491 --> 00:20:30.162 line:5%,start
Do not even associate with Cathy.

00:20:30.229 --> 00:20:31.563 line:95%,end
Just turn and walk away.

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:32.764 line:95%,end
So here we are.

00:20:32.831 --> 00:20:33.966 line:95%,end
<i>It's Nationals.</i>

00:20:34.032 --> 00:20:36.468 line:95%,end

00:20:36.535 --> 00:20:39.071 line:5%,start
And I think that this
is going to be a great day.

00:20:39.137 --> 00:20:41.240 line:95%,end
Girls, come on.

00:20:41.306 --> 00:20:42.241 line:95%,end
This is Nationals.

00:20:42.307 --> 00:20:44.209 line:95%,end
You worked all year.

00:20:44.276 --> 00:20:47.179 line:95%,end
Every single day that you've been
in that studio rehearsing,

00:20:47.246 --> 00:20:49.681 line:95%,end
every weekend that we've flown
to a competition

00:20:49.748 --> 00:20:51.750 line:95%,end
has led up to this point today.

00:20:51.817 --> 00:20:55.320 line:95%,end
What you do on that stage
could change the rest of your life.

00:20:55.954 --> 00:20:56.822 line:95%,end
Understood?

00:20:56.888 --> 00:20:58.390 line:95%,end
Maddie, you were up first.

00:20:58.457 --> 00:21:00.158 line:95%,end
Chloe, I'm going to have to get ready.

00:21:00.225 --> 00:21:02.527 line:95%,end
Because we need to do some
psyching out with Justice.

00:21:03.629 --> 00:21:04.463 line:95%,end
CATHY: Come on.

00:21:04.529 --> 00:21:05.364 line:95%,end
Let's go.

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:08.867 line:95%,end
Listen, Nationals--
this is it for us. Okay?

00:21:08.934 --> 00:21:10.302 line:95%,end
We go home after this.

00:21:10.369 --> 00:21:14.940 line:95%,end
And it would be nice if we could
leave here with a National win.

00:21:15.007 --> 00:21:18.143 line:95%,end
We have a confidence level
that knows that we're a classy act.

00:21:18.877 --> 00:21:23.181 line:95%,end
<i>We have a wonderful routine</i>

00:21:23.248 --> 00:21:27.452 line:95%,end
<i>that, finally, we may be able</i>
<i>to possibly beat Abby.</i>

00:21:27.519 --> 00:21:30.222 line:95%,end
This is Nationals. It'd would be
great if we could pull out a win.

00:21:30.289 --> 00:21:35.394 line:95%,end
C-A-D-C.

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:36.928 line:95%,end
C-A-D-C.

00:21:36.995 --> 00:21:38.263 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>Sure enough, its Cathy,</i>

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:41.400 line:95%,end
<i>making a complete idiot</i>
<i>out of herself and those poor kids.</i>

00:21:41.466 --> 00:21:42.534 line:95%,end
How do they put up with it?

00:21:42.601 --> 00:21:45.203 line:95%,end
I would be mortified
if my teacher ever did that.

00:21:45.771 --> 00:21:48.407 line:95%,end
CATHY: No matter what the wide load
has to say about us,

00:21:48.473 --> 00:21:49.441 line:95%,end
we were invited.

00:21:49.508 --> 00:21:50.942 line:95%,end
And we have every right to be here.

00:21:51.009 --> 00:21:51.877 line:95%,end
ABBY: Don't forget, Chloe,

00:21:51.943 --> 00:21:53.545 line:95%,end
you're going backstage with Maddie.

00:21:53.612 --> 00:21:54.780 line:95%,end
Find Justice.

00:21:54.846 --> 00:21:55.681 line:95%,end
Get in his face.

00:21:55.747 --> 00:21:57.249 line:95%,end
Do one right turn.

00:21:57.316 --> 00:21:58.150 line:95%,end
CATHY: All right, Justice,

00:21:58.216 --> 00:22:01.920 line:95%,end
in the event that anybody
is backstage from Abby Lee

00:22:02.654 --> 00:22:04.489 line:95%,end
-and they comment--
-I say, good luck.

00:22:04.556 --> 00:22:06.491 line:95%,end
Good luck, that's right, smart boy.

00:22:06.558 --> 00:22:09.394 line:95%,end
And they comment--
don't let it rattle you,

00:22:09.461 --> 00:22:11.630 line:95%,end

00:22:11.697 --> 00:22:13.432 line:95%,end

And it's Nationals.

00:22:27.212 --> 00:22:28.914 line:5%,start

Stay in on the words.

Abby is so sidetracked
with Cathy being here.

00:25:05.804 --> 00:25:07.539 line:95%,end
Like, my daughter ran her dance 10 times.

00:25:07.606 --> 00:25:09.341 line:95%,end
And not once did she even look at her.

You've come a long way.

00:25:17.249 --> 00:25:19.751 line:95%,end
And you're going out there
to put Vivi-Anne in her place.

00:25:19.818 --> 00:25:21.753 line:95%,end
If you don't win,
it defeats the whole purpose

of doing the bee dance.

00:25:22.854 --> 00:25:23.855 line:95%,end
And I look like an idiot.

00:25:23.922 --> 00:25:26.224 line:95%,end
And that's not going
to happen around Cathy.

00:25:26.291 --> 00:25:28.393 line:95%,end
Come on, girls, game faces. Let's do it.

00:38:37.348 --> 00:38:38.816 line:95%,end

GIRLS: Abby Lee Dance Company!

ABBY: The Abby Lee
Dance Company remains a force

00:38:47.591 --> 00:38:48.559 line:95%,end
to be reckoned with.

00:38:52.963 --> 00:38:54.065 line:95%,end
(tense music playing)

CATHY: <i>There are few dances,</i>

00:38:55.533 --> 00:38:59.136 line:95%,end
<i>in my lifetime,</i>
<i>that I have literally walked away</i>

00:38:59.203 --> 00:39:01.205 line:95%,end
<i>and thought about days later.</i>

00:39:01.272 --> 00:39:06.010 line:95%,end
And I just wanted to keep
reliving Abby's "Last Text" number

00:39:06.077 --> 00:39:07.144 line:95%,end
because it was brilliant.

00:39:10.581 --> 00:39:11.749 line:95%,end
JILL: Kelly, what's wrong?

00:39:11.816 --> 00:39:13.451 line:95%,end
Nothing. I just--

00:39:14.118 --> 00:39:16.620 line:95%,end
it's hard to watch your kids on stage
and think it's the last time

00:39:16.687 --> 00:39:18.189 line:95%,end
you're gonna watch them dance.

00:39:20.991 --> 00:39:22.927 line:95%,end
I just don't want to come back.

00:39:22.993 --> 00:39:24.695 line:95%,end
It has been a really hard year.

00:39:25.496 --> 00:39:27.531 line:95%,end
I--I'm just tired of Abby

00:39:27.598 --> 00:39:29.600 line:95%,end
<i>and just the way she treats them.</i>

00:39:29.667 --> 00:39:31.569 line:95%,end
Personally, I don't want
to get into an argument.

00:39:31.635 --> 00:39:33.771 line:95%,end
But I think a lot of things
are taken for granted.

00:39:34.238 --> 00:39:36.574 line:95%,end
And I think you don't know
how lucky you have it

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:37.908 line:95%,end
and how lucky your kids are.

00:39:37.975 --> 00:39:40.611 line:95%,end
KELLY: How can you really say
that my kids are lucky, really?

00:39:40.678 --> 00:39:41.679 line:95%,end
They're here.

00:39:41.746 --> 00:39:44.014 line:95%,end
Every other dance studio,
they're back in Pittsburgh already.

00:39:44.081 --> 00:39:45.182 line:95%,end
<i>People think I'm cold.</i>

00:39:45.249 --> 00:39:50.755 line:95%,end
They don't realize the hell that
that woman has put me through.

00:39:50.821 --> 00:39:54.258 line:95%,end
Find somebody else that's gonna do
what I've done for your children.

00:39:54.325 --> 00:39:56.260 line:95%,end
I thought Brooke was outstanding.

00:39:56.327 --> 00:39:58.996 line:95%,end
Yeah. But Brooke was outstanding
because Brooke went over there

00:39:59.063 --> 00:40:00.297 line:95%,end
and practiced on her own.

00:40:00.364 --> 00:40:02.933 line:95%,end
Right, Kelly.
She's 14 years old.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.435 line:95%,end
-And she should.
-The entire day.

00:40:04.502 --> 00:40:06.036 line:95%,end
She finally wanted something.

00:40:06.103 --> 00:40:07.872 line:95%,end
The reason she's third, or fourth,

00:40:07.938 --> 00:40:10.007 line:95%,end
or sixth is because of her face.

00:40:10.074 --> 00:40:11.175 line:95%,end
She wised up.

00:40:11.242 --> 00:40:12.676 line:95%,end
She went out there and she should--

00:40:12.743 --> 00:40:14.945 line:95%,end
she did what she should have
been doing in September.

00:40:15.012 --> 00:40:17.081 line:95%,end
(girls cheering)

00:40:17.148 --> 00:40:18.883 line:95%,end
-JILL: Congratulations!

00:40:18.949 --> 00:40:20.217 line:95%,end
Congratulations.
You were beautiful.

<i>Everybody's back in the dressing room.</i>

00:40:22.086 --> 00:40:23.354 line:95%,end
<i>The kids are celebrating.</i>

00:40:23.888 --> 00:40:25.923 line:95%,end
<i>They know they went out</i>
<i>there and nailed it.</i>

00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:28.559 line:95%,end
They felt the response
of the judges and the audience.

00:40:28.626 --> 00:40:30.027 line:95%,end
Girls, congratulations.

00:40:30.094 --> 00:40:33.297 line:95%,end
Everybody that danced the solo,
you were outstanding.

00:40:33.364 --> 00:40:35.032 line:95%,end
You beat Justice. Woo-hoo.

00:40:35.099 --> 00:40:37.001 line:95%,end
Brooke, you beat all those girls
that were two feet taller

00:40:37.067 --> 00:40:38.502 line:95%,end
and their legs were up to here.

00:40:38.569 --> 00:40:39.637 line:95%,end
And the group number,

00:40:39.703 --> 00:40:41.572 line:95%,end
everybody did what they needed to do.

00:40:41.639 --> 00:40:43.441 line:95%,end
And everybody was an integral part of it.

00:40:43.507 --> 00:40:44.675 line:95%,end
And I thought it was wonderful.

00:40:44.742 --> 00:40:45.810 line:95%,end
We did it.

00:40:45.876 --> 00:40:47.011 line:95%,end
Justice...

00:40:47.077 --> 00:40:48.379 line:95%,end
ALL: Has been served.

00:40:48.446 --> 00:40:49.547 line:95%,end
ABBY: Congratulations.

JILL: Thank you, Abby.

00:40:52.082 --> 00:40:55.152 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I really hope, sincerely,
from the bottom of my heart,

00:40:55.219 --> 00:40:57.721 line:95%,end
that you put some time
and space between yourself

00:40:57.788 --> 00:41:00.524 line:95%,end
and this situation,
and you think things through.

00:41:00.591 --> 00:41:03.761 line:5%,start
HOLLY: <i>I never really thought</i>
<i>that the time would come that</i>

00:41:03.828 --> 00:41:06.997 line:5%,start
Kelly would make
a decision that she's done.

00:41:07.064 --> 00:41:08.432 line:5%,start
Nobody here...

00:41:09.433 --> 00:41:12.203 line:5%,start
wants to see any of you leave.

00:41:12.269 --> 00:41:15.239 line:5%,start
MELISSA: <i>The team definitely won't be</i>
<i>the same without Kelly, Paige, and Brooke.</i>

00:41:15.306 --> 00:41:18.075 line:5%,start
Dysfunctional as it may be,
we're definitely a family.

00:41:18.142 --> 00:41:22.413 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: This team is not
a team without you guys.

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:24.348 line:5%,start
It's not. You're my sister.

00:41:24.882 --> 00:41:25.916 line:5%,start
And you're my family.

00:41:25.983 --> 00:41:27.351 line:5%,start
You cannot leave me here.

00:41:27.418 --> 00:41:29.854 line:5%,start
(tense music playing)

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:30.921 line:5%,start
You can't.
