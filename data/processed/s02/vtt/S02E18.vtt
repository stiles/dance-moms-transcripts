<i>It's Mackenzie from Abby Lee Dance.</i>

00:26:52.177 --> 00:26:54.512 line:95%,end
ABBY: Maybe Mackenzie
has what it takes after all.

00:26:54.579 --> 00:26:56.348 line:95%,end
I always compare her to Maddie

00:26:56.414 --> 00:26:59.050 line:95%,end
and maybe I shouldn't, but how can I not?

00:26:59.117 --> 00:27:00.118 line:95%,end
They're sisters.

00:27:00.185 --> 00:27:03.855 line:95%,end
When Maddie was seven,
she was already doing the work

00:27:03.922 --> 00:27:05.757 line:95%,end
of 13 and 14-year-olds.

00:27:05.824 --> 00:27:07.192 line:95%,end
Now we have Mackenzie.

00:27:07.258 --> 00:27:09.194 line:95%,end
That kid cartwheels from the minute

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:11.296 line:95%,end
she wakes up in the morning,
until her head hits

00:27:11.363 --> 00:27:12.664 line:95%,end
that pillow at night.

00:27:12.731 --> 00:27:16.067 line:95%,end
This kid is sassy, and bratty,

00:27:16.134 --> 00:27:18.737 line:95%,end
and nobody's going to tell her what to do.

00:27:18.803 --> 00:27:20.905 line:95%,end
Well, except me.

00:27:21.272 --> 00:27:25.076 line:95%,end
<i>It's no secret that Maddie and Chloe</i>

00:27:25.143 --> 00:27:27.712 line:95%,end
<i>So when I paired them together</i>
<i>in a beautiful duet,</i>

00:27:27.779 --> 00:27:29.681 line:95%,end
<i>it was nothing less than stellar.</i>

00:27:29.748 --> 00:27:31.883 line:95%,end
<i>The less these moms get involved,</i>

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:33.485 line:95%,end

00:27:33.551 --> 00:27:36.721 line:95%,end

Maddie and Chloe on stage together?

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:20.091 line:95%,end
Breathtaking.

00:29:20.158 --> 00:29:22.127 line:95%,end
These two push each other.

00:29:22.193 --> 00:29:25.597 line:95%,end
They push each other hard,
and they compliment each other.


00:29:25.663 --> 00:29:27.265 line:95%,end
They have nice lines.

00:29:27.332 --> 00:29:28.466 line:95%,end
Their feet are pointed.

00:29:28.533 --> 00:29:29.701 line:95%,end
Their knees are straight.

00:29:29.768 --> 00:29:32.537 line:95%,end
They want to win,
and they want to work together.

00:29:32.604 --> 00:29:34.739 line:95%,end
I just wish that Melissa and Christi

00:29:34.806 --> 00:29:36.474 line:95%,end
would learn to work together.

00:29:36.541 --> 00:29:39.811 line:95%,end
It would be so much better
if these two moms

00:29:39.878 --> 00:29:42.614 line:95%,end
could get on the same track
as their daughters.

00:29:43.314 --> 00:29:46.351 line:95%,end
<i>Every once in a while,</i>
