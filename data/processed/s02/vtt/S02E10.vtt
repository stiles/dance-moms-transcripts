ABBY: <i>Previously on </i>Dance Moms...

00:00:02.802 --> 00:00:06.039 line:5%,start
I would like for Nia
to be considered for the trio.

00:00:06.106 --> 00:00:07.374 line:5%,start
This is my domain.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.575 line:5%,start
I'm the principal here.

00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:10.010 line:5%,start
But you're expelled. You're done.

00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:11.878 line:5%,start
(screaming) Get the the hell out! Go!

00:00:12.245 --> 00:00:13.713 line:5%,start
DOCTOR: What's giving you trouble?

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:15.315 line:5%,start
I have three warts.

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:16.583 line:5%,start
DOCTOR: Three warts.

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:19.586 line:5%,start
You would not be able to dance
if it's uncomfortable.

00:00:19.652 --> 00:00:22.022 line:5%,start
You told me that you think you can do it.

00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:25.325 line:5%,start
CATHY: <i>I got Kendall</i>
<i>an opportunity to dance</i>

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:26.793 line:5%,start
<i>with the Harlem Globetrotters.</i>

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.029 line:5%,start

ABBY: <i>Coming up on </i>Dance Moms...

00:00:30.663 --> 00:00:32.532 line:5%,start
What about these mothers
picking on Melissa?

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:33.767 line:5%,start
-I mean--
-It's everyday.

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:35.435 line:5%,start
Those two just better back off,

00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:37.670 line:5%,start
or Melissa is going to lose it.

00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:39.639 line:5%,start
MELISSA: Abby, I'm sorry to interrupt you,

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:41.708 line:5%,start
but these people are starting this again.

00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:44.477 line:5%,start
So my kids and I are leaving
and we're not going this weekend.

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:46.746 line:5%,start
All we were doing was asking.

00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:50.550 line:5%,start
CATHY: What I've put together
is a clown number.

00:00:50.617 --> 00:00:54.354 line:5%,start
I specifically chose Taylor
as a tightrope walker

00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:56.990 line:5%,start
because you have
the most incredible grand jÃ©tÃ©s.

00:00:57.057 --> 00:01:00.060 line:5%,start
(dramatic music playing)

00:01:01.661 --> 00:01:04.664 line:5%,start

ABBY: <i>Come on, ladies. Let's go!</i>

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:26.753 line:5%,start
Get in here with those fabulous tans.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.421 line:95%,end
Come on. Come on.

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:30.356 line:95%,end
Wow.

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:34.094 line:95%,end
This mother's association
is dwindling to a trio, huh?

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.495 line:95%,end
Holly's at work.

00:01:35.562 --> 00:01:36.596 line:95%,end
Of course.

00:01:36.663 --> 00:01:39.232 line:95%,end
First, Nia.

00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:42.769 line:95%,end
Honey, my heart stopped.

00:01:42.836 --> 00:01:45.839 line:95%,end
(crowd cheering)

00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:50.577 line:95%,end
You guys always think I'm the bad guy,

00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:55.482 line:95%,end
but I don't want any kid,
even if it's not my student, to stop.

00:01:55.548 --> 00:01:56.983 line:95%,end
I just don't want it to happen again,

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.252 line:95%,end
and I don't think it should
have happened in the first place.

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:00.553 line:95%,end
You're better than that.

00:02:00.887 --> 00:02:03.723 line:95%,end
Moving on, Mackenzie.

00:02:04.557 --> 00:02:07.393 line:95%,end
Mackenzie,
there's some things to improve on.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.395 line:95%,end
Next, I have Brooke.

00:02:10.196 --> 00:02:11.731 line:95%,end
I thought you did a great job.

00:02:12.232 --> 00:02:14.367 line:95%,end
And next, we have Chloe.

00:02:15.068 --> 00:02:17.470 line:95%,end
Chloe, the solo was excellent.

00:02:17.537 --> 00:02:20.006 line:95%,end
However, the trio was a little shaky.

00:02:20.073 --> 00:02:22.175 line:95%,end
Next, Paige.

00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:25.478 line:95%,end
Paige, you worked through
the pain in your feet.

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:27.280 line:95%,end
Even in the dressing room,

00:02:27.347 --> 00:02:30.216 line:95%,end
when you should have had
those feet up and icing them,

00:02:31.017 --> 00:02:32.752 line:95%,end
you were doing the dance over and over.

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.121 line:95%,end
All right, at the top of the pyramid,

00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:38.591 line:95%,end
Maddie, I challenge you
to see if you could stay there

00:02:38.658 --> 00:02:40.493 line:95%,end
for three weeks in a row, and you did.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.095 line:95%,end
<i>I told you where those judges were,</i>

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:44.364 line:95%,end
<i>you never took your eyes off of them.</i>

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.033 line:95%,end
If you can get the judges
to look you in the eye

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.101 line:95%,end
and suck them in,

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:50.203 line:95%,end
then you have them
in the palm of your hand.

00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:53.673 line:95%,end
MADDIE: <i>I was so excited</i>
<i>to be in the top of the pyramid again.</i>

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.010 line:5%,start
And I think the stuff
that Abby's telling me to do

00:02:57.076 --> 00:02:59.312 line:5%,start
is making me become a better dancer.

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.981 line:95%,end
ABBY: Now, each and every one of you

00:03:02.048 --> 00:03:04.050 line:95%,end
are very lucky little girls.

00:03:05.451 --> 00:03:06.586 line:95%,end
You have beautiful homes.

00:03:06.653 --> 00:03:09.422 line:95%,end
You have everything you need.

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.157 line:95%,end
Some kids aren't that lucky.

00:03:11.224 --> 00:03:13.860 line:95%,end
So our group routine
is about a homeless child.

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:17.897 line:95%,end
There's also going to be a solo
this weekend.

00:03:17.964 --> 00:03:19.832 line:95%,end
Maddie, you will be doing a solo.

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:22.769 line:95%,end
You better dance your heart out
and dance your butt off.

00:03:23.436 --> 00:03:24.504 line:95%,end
I have a trio.

00:03:24.571 --> 00:03:25.972 line:95%,end
This is a new trio.,

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:28.208 line:95%,end
and I'm going to start mixing things up.

00:03:28.808 --> 00:03:29.776 line:95%,end
So...

00:03:30.777 --> 00:03:32.979 line:95%,end
Chloe, you're in the trio,

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:34.447 line:95%,end
Maddie, you're in the trio,

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.851 line:95%,end
And Nia you're in the trio.

00:03:38.918 --> 00:03:40.253 line:95%,end
-ALL: Yay!
-(cheering and applause)

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.855 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>I really want give Nia</i>
<i>a chance to redeem herself</i>

00:03:42.922 --> 00:03:44.958 line:5%,start
after that debacle last week.

00:03:45.024 --> 00:03:47.393 line:5%,start
Nia, you have a lot to prove this week.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.796 line:5%,start
I want this tria so badly

00:03:49.862 --> 00:03:53.166 line:5%,start
because I wanna show Miss Abby
that I can do a trio.

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:55.368 line:95%,end
I can work with other people.

00:03:55.435 --> 00:03:57.637 line:95%,end
I can dance.

00:03:58.938 --> 00:04:01.040 line:95%,end
If you don't keep up
with Maddie and Chloe--

00:04:04.043 --> 00:04:06.579 line:95%,end
all right now, listen closely,
girls and moms.

00:04:06.646 --> 00:04:10.083 line:95%,end
I found out that we will be competing
against Candy Apple

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:12.151 line:95%,end
in Chicago, a company dance.

00:04:12.986 --> 00:04:14.320 line:95%,end
But I'll tell you what.

00:04:14.387 --> 00:04:16.122 line:95%,end
I am not going to lose

00:04:16.556 --> 00:04:19.525 line:95%,end
to Cathy, or Jill, or Kendall.

00:04:19.592 --> 00:04:22.528 line:95%,end
Hey, moms. Thank you, you're dismissed.

00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:24.430 line:95%,end
You don't have any jobs to do.

00:04:24.497 --> 00:04:26.799 line:95%,end
Go, spread apart. Start shutting.

00:04:26.866 --> 00:04:29.736 line:95%,end
Gianna is going to come in
and we are starting this dance right now.

00:04:32.572 --> 00:04:33.806 line:95%,end
All right, let's go again.

00:04:34.207 --> 00:04:35.241 line:5%,start
Go.

00:04:35.308 --> 00:04:38.544 line:5%,start
SINGER: <i>âª</i><i>Seems it's taken far too long âª</i>

00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:42.282 line:5%,start
<i>âª</i><i>I've been stuck on this same song âª</i>

00:04:42.348 --> 00:04:44.517 line:5%,start
ABBY: <i>The music</i>
<i>for this week's group number</i>

00:04:44.584 --> 00:04:46.519 line:95%,end
<i>is entitled </i>Trapped,

00:04:46.586 --> 00:04:49.589 line:95%,end
<i>but the piece is about a homeless child.</i>

00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:53.192 line:95%,end
<i>And all these other little girls</i>
<i>in the neighborhood discover her,</i>

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:54.961 line:95%,end
and they lend her a dress,


00:04:55.028 --> 00:04:56.929 line:95%,end
and they put a bow in her hair,

00:04:56.996 --> 00:04:58.331 line:95%,end
and they help her out.

00:04:58.398 --> 00:05:01.034 line:95%,end
Then Chloe needs to do like a pretty--

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.201 line:95%,end
like arabesques.

00:05:02.268 --> 00:05:04.304 line:95%,end
So we're homeless.

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.274 line:95%,end
I have nothing negative to say
about this dance choice.

00:05:08.341 --> 00:05:09.676 line:95%,end
I don't--I think it's going to be good.

00:05:09.742 --> 00:05:11.878 line:95%,end
I don't think we need
any of our rhinestones.

00:05:11.944 --> 00:05:13.212 line:95%,end
-No.
-(laughs)

00:05:14.714 --> 00:05:15.715 line:95%,end
Arch,

00:05:17.016 --> 00:05:18.518 line:95%,end
arch, hold. Now--

00:05:18.584 --> 00:05:20.520 line:95%,end
KELLY: In Chicago, we should go out.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.188 line:95%,end
Oh, yeah.

00:05:22.955 --> 00:05:24.724 line:95%,end
Like, what is that called?

00:05:25.258 --> 00:05:27.694 line:95%,end
-Uh--
-Where all the bars are on the one street.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.595 line:95%,end
-Rehab?
-(chuckles)

00:05:29.662 --> 00:05:30.630 line:95%,end
Naw!

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.632 line:95%,end
And I didn't want to tell her the news.

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:33.700 line:95%,end
-I wanted to...
-(indistinct chatter)

00:05:33.766 --> 00:05:35.635 line:95%,end
...I wanted her to hear it from all of us.

00:05:35.702 --> 00:05:36.669 line:95%,end
-CHRISTI: Oh, yeah.
-And Melissa was saying

00:05:36.736 --> 00:05:38.905 line:95%,end
there is excitement and happy news,

00:05:38.971 --> 00:05:40.606 line:95%,end
and we're in a dance studio,
so I'm not too sure.

00:05:40.673 --> 00:05:41.708 line:95%,end
(indistinct chatter)

00:05:41.774 --> 00:05:43.643 line:95%,end
And Abby Lee Miller is in the building.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:44.777 line:95%,end
-Right, exactly.
-CHRISTI: But I think

00:05:44.844 --> 00:05:46.646 line:95%,end
that she's been replaced by a pod person

00:05:46.713 --> 00:05:47.947 line:95%,end
because she's acting too nice,

00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:50.350 line:95%,end
and I haven't seen that kind
of behavior in nine years.

00:05:50.416 --> 00:05:51.784 line:95%,end
That mean she's up to something.

00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:52.819 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I don't know.

00:05:52.885 --> 00:05:56.022 line:95%,end
And I think she's handling you
with kid gloves.

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:57.056 line:95%,end
-Me?
-MELISSA: Look!

00:05:57.123 --> 00:05:58.358 line:95%,end
Look, Nia's trying to tell you something.

00:05:58.424 --> 00:05:59.425 line:95%,end
Go.

00:05:59.792 --> 00:06:01.694 line:95%,end
Did she say--she said me, three.

00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:02.962 line:95%,end
-Figure it out.
-(gasps)

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:04.263 line:95%,end
-She's in a trio?
-MELISSA: Yeah!

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.499 line:95%,end
No way!

00:06:06.566 --> 00:06:07.867 line:95%,end
-No way.
-CHRISTI: Yay!

00:06:07.934 --> 00:06:08.968 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Look at her.

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.605 line:95%,end
Oh, like what?

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.675 line:95%,end
Boom. Two, reach.

00:06:15.742 --> 00:06:17.510 line:95%,end
Now--yeah, just hands

00:06:17.577 --> 00:06:19.545 line:95%,end
and then face, face, face.

00:06:19.612 --> 00:06:20.747 line:95%,end
KELLY: Where the hell were you, Holly?

00:06:20.813 --> 00:06:21.781 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Where've you been, Dr. Holly?

00:06:21.848 --> 00:06:24.016 line:95%,end
You've really made
a gallant effort to be here

00:06:24.083 --> 00:06:25.051 line:95%,end
ever since, you know,

00:06:25.118 --> 00:06:27.220 line:95%,end
you were rapped on the knuckles
with your ruler

00:06:27.286 --> 00:06:28.855 line:95%,end
for missing class the first week.

00:06:28.921 --> 00:06:30.890 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Now, I'm showing up and I'm here,

00:06:30.957 --> 00:06:33.426 line:95%,end
but I had some loose ends
to tie up at school

00:06:33.493 --> 00:06:35.828 line:95%,end
and I have made a decision

00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:38.664 line:95%,end
that I'm going to take a leave
of absence for...

00:06:38.731 --> 00:06:40.400 line:95%,end
-MELISSA: Yay!
-HOLLY: ...next year.

00:06:40.466 --> 00:06:43.970 line:95%,end
So next year, I'm going to spend more time

00:06:44.036 --> 00:06:45.538 line:95%,end

-(indistinct).

(indistinct chatter)

00:06:47.173 --> 00:06:48.808 line:95%,end
The boys are home.

00:06:48.875 --> 00:06:52.412 line:5%,start
The whole idea of not working
is a little scary to me,

00:06:53.012 --> 00:06:55.748 line:95%,end
but I'm ready for a new chapter in my life

00:06:55.815 --> 00:06:57.917 line:95%,end
and to have a chance to breathe

00:06:57.984 --> 00:07:00.953 line:95%,end
<i>and enjoy the experiences</i>
<i>with my family and my friends.</i>

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.523 line:95%,end
Think about all the times
that you're rushing to do here and there,

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:05.258 line:95%,end
and, like, divide your time
between your kids.

00:07:05.324 --> 00:07:07.760 line:95%,end
-That's what was part of the decision.
-KELLY: Although, I don't know.

00:07:07.827 --> 00:07:10.997 line:95%,end
I don't work and I never get time
to go see my son's hockey games

00:07:11.063 --> 00:07:13.299 line:95%,end
-because I'm always here.
-Mm-hmm.

00:07:13.366 --> 00:07:15.735 line:95%,end
I know, but you weren't
working a full-time job,

00:07:15.802 --> 00:07:17.336 line:95%,end
and earning a doctorate, and...
-And also, how come...

00:07:17.403 --> 00:07:19.038 line:95%,end
-...having three kids.
-...I can't seem to fit that in.

00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:20.940 line:95%,end
-HOLLY: (laughing)
-CHRISTI: I'm not sure.

00:07:21.007 --> 00:07:23.810 line:95%,end
Maybe I ought to give up some
of that afternoon drinking.

00:07:24.744 --> 00:07:26.946 line:95%,end
(dramatic music playing)

00:07:27.713 --> 00:07:29.182 line:95%,end
CATHY: <i>Little apples.</i>

00:07:29.248 --> 00:07:30.550 line:95%,end
Hi, girls.

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:33.352 line:95%,end
Hello, Mr. Justice.

00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:36.689 line:95%,end
So everybody, I just wanted
to give you the announcement.

00:07:36.756 --> 00:07:38.391 line:95%,end
We are going to Chicago.

00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:40.927 line:95%,end
-(cheering and clapping)
-CATHY: Ooh, that sounds like fun.

00:07:40.993 --> 00:07:43.930 line:95%,end
Justice is going to be doing
his solo again.

00:07:43.996 --> 00:07:47.366 line:95%,end
So I really want him
to be our knight in shining armor

00:07:47.433 --> 00:07:48.501 line:95%,end
for this competition.

00:07:48.568 --> 00:07:52.939 line:95%,end
And what I've put together
is a clown number.

00:07:53.005 --> 00:07:56.042 line:95%,end
It's not like the ooh-ooh,
that kind of clown number.

00:07:56.108 --> 00:07:57.510 line:95%,end
It's very dark.

00:07:57.577 --> 00:08:01.647 line:95%,end
And I specifically chose Taylor
as a tightrope walker

00:08:01.714 --> 00:08:04.450 line:95%,end
because you have
the most incredible grand jÃ©tÃ©s.

00:08:04.517 --> 00:08:07.920 line:95%,end
So I'm hoping that that's going
to be like a magical moment for you.

00:08:07.987 --> 00:08:10.156 line:95%,end
And of course, you know,
we all know who the clown is.

00:08:10.223 --> 00:08:11.858 line:95%,end
That clown lives over in Pennsylvania.

00:08:11.924 --> 00:08:13.659 line:95%,end
She doesn't live here in Ohio.

00:08:13.726 --> 00:08:16.429 line:95%,end
(laughing)

00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:19.465 line:5%,start
I am really looking forward to competing

00:08:19.532 --> 00:08:21.667 line:5%,start
at company dance in Chicago.

00:08:21.734 --> 00:08:24.437 line:95%,end
I have Justice going head to head
with Maddie,

00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:27.840 line:95%,end
and I have a fabulous group number

00:08:27.907 --> 00:08:29.742 line:95%,end
that's going to knock
the socks off the judges.

00:08:29.809 --> 00:08:31.477 line:95%,end
We've got a lot of rehearsing to do.

00:08:31.544 --> 00:08:35.548 line:95%,end
So thank you for coming in,
and kids will be done in about an hour.

00:08:36.048 --> 00:08:37.316 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>I think the color's great.</i>

00:08:37.383 --> 00:08:38.885 line:95%,end
<i>I think they're going to look good</i>
<i>on everybody.</i>

00:08:38.951 --> 00:08:41.587 line:95%,end
Now, what am I going to do with Maddie

00:08:41.654 --> 00:08:44.290 line:95%,end
to make her homeless
that she can still dance in?

00:08:44.357 --> 00:08:47.960 line:95%,end
<i>Thank goodness</i>
<i>the homeless don't wear anything crazy.</i>

00:08:48.027 --> 00:08:49.929 line:95%,end
The mothers should not have anything

00:08:49.996 --> 00:08:51.531 line:95%,end
to complain about this week.

00:08:51.597 --> 00:08:53.566 line:95%,end
Now, that takes care of the group.

00:08:53.633 --> 00:08:55.301 line:95%,end
What about this trio?

00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:56.802 line:95%,end
-With Nia?
-It's a mess.

00:08:56.869 --> 00:08:59.605 line:95%,end
<i>She's never danced with them,</i>
<i>and they're really good together.</i>

00:08:59.672 --> 00:09:01.841 line:95%,end
Well, I think that in Holly's mind,

00:09:01.908 --> 00:09:03.209 line:95%,end
if Nia is stuck in

00:09:03.276 --> 00:09:04.510 line:95%,end
with Chloe and Maddie...
-(snaps fingers)

00:09:04.577 --> 00:09:05.645 line:95%,end
she's going to look like Chloe and Maddie.

00:09:05.711 --> 00:09:06.746 line:95%,end
And it's going to click.

00:09:06.812 --> 00:09:08.481 line:95%,end
Then it's going to click,
and I don't think so.

00:09:08.814 --> 00:09:10.316 line:95%,end
And I don't want to embarrass that child.

00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:12.251 line:95%,end
I'm willing to give Nia a chance.

00:09:12.318 --> 00:09:14.387 line:95%,end
But she's going to have to put the work in

00:09:14.453 --> 00:09:17.156 line:95%,end
if she wants to shine
next to Chloe and Maddie.

00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:18.891 line:95%,end
-I don't know. If Nia...
-I think we should (indistinct)

00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.726 line:95%,end
...well, I'd like to put up with that.

00:09:20.793 --> 00:09:22.695 line:95%,end
I'm going to have Holly down
my throat again.

00:09:23.229 --> 00:09:25.031 line:95%,end
<i>And what about these mothers</i>
<i>picking on Melissa.</i>

00:09:25.097 --> 00:09:26.232 line:95%,end
-I mean--
-It's everyday.

00:09:26.599 --> 00:09:27.900 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I am so sick of this.

00:09:27.967 --> 00:09:29.001 line:95%,end
They're ignorant to me and Maddie,

00:09:29.068 --> 00:09:30.937 line:95%,end
all the time, these mothers.
And I'm done with it.

00:09:31.003 --> 00:09:33.205 line:95%,end
I mean, first they're jealous of the kid.

00:09:33.272 --> 00:09:35.875 line:95%,end
I mean, they can't see straight
about Maddie.

00:09:35.942 --> 00:09:37.610 line:95%,end
Now they're jealous of Melissa.

00:09:37.677 --> 00:09:40.012 line:95%,end
They pick on her,
like, through junior high.

00:09:40.079 --> 00:09:41.547 line:95%,end
-It's ridiculous.
-(indistinct)

00:09:41.614 --> 00:09:43.215 line:95%,end
Those two just better back off

00:09:43.282 --> 00:09:45.451 line:95%,end
or Melissa is going to lose it.

00:09:46.285 --> 00:09:47.453 line:95%,end
They will be sorry.


00:09:49.789 --> 00:09:52.792 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:09:54.026 --> 00:09:55.027 line:95%,end
-JILL: Hello.
-MELISSA: Hey.

00:09:55.094 --> 00:09:56.195 line:95%,end
JILL: Hi.

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:57.663 line:95%,end
-Hey.
-I'm sorry I'm a little late.

00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:59.632 line:95%,end
MELISSA: <i>I still talk to Jill</i>
<i>because she's my friend,</i>

00:09:59.699 --> 00:10:02.501 line:5%,start
and I really like her
and my daughter loves Kendall.

00:10:02.568 --> 00:10:03.970 line:5%,start
They're good friends.

00:10:04.036 --> 00:10:05.538 line:95%,end
So I really don't care

00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:07.406 line:95%,end
if the moms get mad at me
for talking to her.

00:10:07.473 --> 00:10:08.641 line:95%,end
It's just tough.

00:10:08.708 --> 00:10:10.309 line:95%,end
-Do you look great.
-Oh, so do you.

00:10:10.376 --> 00:10:11.744 line:95%,end
You look like you've lost weight.

00:10:11.811 --> 00:10:12.778 line:95%,end
-Are you stressed?
-Maybe a little bit.

00:10:12.845 --> 00:10:14.981 line:95%,end
Maybe a little bit.
There's no time to eat.

00:10:15.047 --> 00:10:17.350 line:95%,end
Well, your drive is forever long.

00:10:17.416 --> 00:10:19.852 line:95%,end
Cathy was so welcoming.

00:10:19.919 --> 00:10:21.387 line:95%,end
She's been really good to Kendall.

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:23.122 line:95%,end
You know what we did the other night?

00:10:23.189 --> 00:10:24.857 line:95%,end
She performed at the Globetrotters.

00:10:24.924 --> 00:10:26.258 line:95%,end
-(gushes)
-She performed

00:10:26.325 --> 00:10:28.194 line:95%,end
in the center of the whole arena

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:29.395 line:95%,end
-(indistinct)
-...and the Globetrotters

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:30.429 line:95%,end
JILL: ...all by her self.

00:10:30.496 --> 00:10:33.432 line:95%,end
My point in telling you this is,
Cathy sets that up for her.

00:10:33.499 --> 00:10:34.634 line:95%,end
She doesn't tear her down.

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.268 line:95%,end
-She's trying to build her up.
-MELISSA: Ooh!

00:10:36.969 --> 00:10:38.037 line:95%,end
-Thank you so much.
-WAITRESS: (indistinct)

00:10:38.104 --> 00:10:39.472 line:95%,end
Not a problem.

00:10:39.538 --> 00:10:41.440 line:95%,end
But, so tell me about you.
What's going on?

00:10:41.507 --> 00:10:43.242 line:95%,end
Um, same old stuff.

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:45.311 line:95%,end
-The engagement's good?
-Everything's great.

00:10:45.378 --> 00:10:46.979 line:95%,end
The other moms are nosey.

00:10:47.046 --> 00:10:49.248 line:95%,end
They're, you know, trying to get
into my personal business.

00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:51.117 line:95%,end
That's 'cause they don't have
a good personal life,

00:10:51.183 --> 00:10:52.618 line:95%,end
so they wanna know about yours.

00:10:52.685 --> 00:10:55.755 line:95%,end
You know, I'm not really talking
about that right now

00:10:55.821 --> 00:10:56.789 line:95%,end
-with, you know, it's just--I mean--
-It's okay.

00:10:56.856 --> 00:10:57.890 line:95%,end
It's no one's business, Melissa.

00:10:57.957 --> 00:10:58.924 line:95%,end
-It's not.
-It's yours.

00:10:58.991 --> 00:10:59.992 line:95%,end
I know, and it's not.

00:11:00.059 --> 00:11:02.728 line:95%,end
I mean, when I decide
to get married in my life,

00:11:02.795 --> 00:11:04.397 line:95%,end
I'm going to let everybody know,

00:11:05.131 --> 00:11:07.500 line:95%,end
and then, they can say
congratulations to me. But--

00:11:07.566 --> 00:11:09.835 line:95%,end
I don't know.
I feel badly that you're stuck in that.

<i>So we threw together,</i>
<i>like, a ganky, sassy, feisty number,</i>

00:11:31.323 --> 00:11:33.225 line:95%,end
<i>but as always, with a trio</i>

00:11:33.292 --> 00:11:36.028 line:5%,start
you need a lot of time to rehearse.

00:11:36.095 --> 00:11:37.596 line:5%,start
It's difficult spacing.

00:11:37.663 --> 00:11:38.964 line:95%,end
It's difficult timing.

00:11:39.732 --> 00:11:40.866 line:95%,end
Body roll.

HOLLY: Nia's super excited about the trio,

00:11:46.172 --> 00:11:48.040 line:95%,end
and I'm super nervous about it.

00:11:48.107 --> 00:11:49.408 line:95%,end
Trios are hard.

00:11:49.475 --> 00:11:51.310 line:95%,end
Maddie and Chloe
have had experience with trios.

00:11:51.377 --> 00:11:52.678 line:95%,end
They've done a duet before.

00:11:52.745 --> 00:11:54.213 line:95%,end
And putting a new person in the group.

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.881 line:95%,end
And you don't want her
to be the scapegoat.

00:11:55.948 --> 00:11:58.150 line:95%,end
Exactly, and she's going to be the one.
She's the weak link.

00:11:58.217 --> 00:11:59.418 line:95%,end
She's already,

00:11:59.485 --> 00:12:00.920 line:95%,end
-has that target on her back...
-I know.

00:12:00.986 --> 00:12:02.188 line:95%,end
HOLLY: ...and I'm trying, I don't want

00:12:02.254 --> 00:12:03.689 line:95%,end
to add any pressure to the kid,

00:12:03.756 --> 00:12:05.791 line:95%,end
but this is a dream of hers,

00:12:05.858 --> 00:12:08.060 line:95%,end
and she's going to be able to fulfill it.

00:12:08.394 --> 00:12:11.897 line:95%,end
She's been waiting since forever
to be in a trio,

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:15.868 line:95%,end
and... I want her to do well.

00:12:15.935 --> 00:12:18.370 line:95%,end

Ode to the Clown,<i> is,</i>

We've got the dark clown

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:53.739 line:5%,start
that walks in slow motion,

00:12:53.806 --> 00:12:56.075 line:95%,end

Okay, guys. That was good.

Kendall make sure that you hit this,

So I will run it again tomorrow
when I see you guys.

Go home. Think about the choreography.
We'll be fine.

00:13:10.956 --> 00:13:13.526 line:95%,end
Get out. Go. I have a rehearsal to run.
Let's go.

00:13:13.592 --> 00:13:15.427 line:95%,end
Vivy, you're not going anywhere,
baby doll.

00:13:16.228 --> 00:13:18.264 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.633 line:95%,end
One, two, three, four,

00:13:20.699 --> 00:13:23.235 line:95%,end
five, six, seven, eight.

00:13:23.302 --> 00:13:25.671 line:95%,end
One, two, three, four,

00:13:25.738 --> 00:13:26.839 line:95%,end
What kind of clothes do you need to get

00:13:26.906 --> 00:13:28.274 line:95%,end
because I want to make sure
I have my clothes.

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:29.308 line:95%,end
What clothes do you need?

00:13:29.375 --> 00:13:30.910 line:95%,end
KELLY: Lunch for Nia. Lunch for you.

00:13:30.976 --> 00:13:33.279 line:95%,end
-Why aren't you wearing your ring?
-Lunch for Nia? Lunch for me?

00:13:33.345 --> 00:13:34.446 line:95%,end
Because I'm not wearing it anymore.

00:13:34.513 --> 00:13:35.581 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Why?

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:38.617 line:95%,end
Just not.

00:13:39.985 --> 00:13:42.021 line:5%,start
Melissa still won't talk
about her engagement,

00:13:42.087 --> 00:13:44.190 line:95%,end
<i>and now she's not wearing her ring.</i>

00:13:44.256 --> 00:13:45.457 line:95%,end
What is going on here?

00:13:46.091 --> 00:13:47.660 line:95%,end
Doesn't that hurt Greg's feelings then?

00:13:48.961 --> 00:13:50.663 line:95%,end
It's just how we're doing it.

00:13:50.729 --> 00:13:53.532 line:95%,end
That's too bad because it's a happy thing,

00:13:53.599 --> 00:13:55.501 line:95%,end
-and you should want to flash your ring...
-Yeah. Like, I don't know why it's not...

00:13:55.568 --> 00:13:56.836 line:95%,end
...and show it off.

00:13:56.902 --> 00:13:59.271 line:95%,end
I could try it out and see if I like it,

00:13:59.338 --> 00:14:02.408 line:95%,end
so that way when I get mine made
I'll know if that's the way I want it.

00:14:02.474 --> 00:14:03.943 line:95%,end
You know, once I put
my engagement ring on,

00:14:04.009 --> 00:14:05.477 line:95%,end
I don't think I ever took it off.

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:09.481 line:95%,end
Do the girls say anything about it?

00:14:11.116 --> 00:14:12.084 line:95%,end
That you don't wear it.

00:14:12.785 --> 00:14:14.653 line:95%,end
-Do they notice it?
-Oh, my God.

00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:18.257 line:95%,end
Seriously.

00:14:18.324 --> 00:14:20.392 line:95%,end
I don't know why the other moms
are so nosy.

00:14:20.459 --> 00:14:22.862 line:95%,end
I think sometimes it's jealousy.

00:14:22.928 --> 00:14:24.463 line:95%,end
Um, I'm really not sure.

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:26.065 line:95%,end
I'm happy in my life.

00:14:26.131 --> 00:14:28.334 line:95%,end
Um, I think they need to worry
about their children,

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.102 line:95%,end
and I'll worry about mine.

00:14:30.169 --> 00:14:31.937 line:95%,end
I'm not going this weekend, guys.

00:14:33.239 --> 00:14:34.840 line:95%,end
Abby, I'm sorry to interrupt you,

00:14:34.907 --> 00:14:36.876 line:95%,end
but these people are starting this again.

00:14:36.942 --> 00:14:39.445 line:95%,end
So my kids and I are leaving,
and we're not going this weekend.

00:14:39.511 --> 00:14:41.547 line:95%,end
Come on, Maddie. (bleep)

00:14:41.614 --> 00:14:44.416 line:95%,end
(tense music playing)

00:14:45.751 --> 00:14:47.753 line:95%,end
Come on, Kensie. We're leaving.
We're not coming this weekend.

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:49.355 line:95%,end
Now Maddie's crying.

00:14:50.222 --> 00:14:51.724 line:95%,end
Maddie, we're really not going.

00:14:52.157 --> 00:14:53.359 line:95%,end
We're not going.

00:14:53.425 --> 00:14:55.895 line:95%,end
ABBY: <i>I knew it.</i>
<i>I knew that these other mothers</i>

00:14:55.961 --> 00:14:58.597 line:95%,end
would eventually push Melissa too far.

00:14:58.664 --> 00:14:59.899 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Abby, tell them.

00:14:59.965 --> 00:15:01.033 line:95%,end
-I'm going.
-MELISSA: Tell them, now.

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:02.234 line:95%,end
MADDIE: I'm going.

00:15:02.301 --> 00:15:03.369 line:95%,end
MELLISA: Maddie,
I know you want to do this.

00:15:03.435 --> 00:15:04.403 line:95%,end
I am not doing this.

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:06.639 line:95%,end
I'm going. I want to go.

00:15:06.705 --> 00:15:09.008 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Maddie can go without me
if you're going to take care of her.

00:15:09.074 --> 00:15:11.343 line:95%,end
-ABBY: I will take her.
-MELLISA: But I'm (indistinct)

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:12.945 line:95%,end
I will go get your clothes.

00:15:13.012 --> 00:15:16.081 line:95%,end
Greg, please call your attorney.

00:15:16.148 --> 00:15:17.316 line:95%,end
These (bleep).

00:15:17.383 --> 00:15:18.784 line:95%,end
They're doing this again.

00:15:20.486 --> 00:15:23.455 line:95%,end
-Thanks Abby.
-(sobbing)

00:15:25.157 --> 00:15:26.125 line:95%,end
Come on.

00:15:26.892 --> 00:15:27.860 line:95%,end
GIRL: What about Maddie?

00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:29.094 line:95%,end
MELLISA: Don't worry about her.

00:15:29.962 --> 00:15:31.764 line:95%,end
All we were doing was asking.

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:33.766 line:95%,end
She tells us everything.


00:15:37.503 --> 00:15:38.470 line:95%,end
MELISSA: <i>Come on.</i>

00:15:39.071 --> 00:15:40.039 line:95%,end
GIRL: What about Maddie?

00:15:40.105 --> 00:15:41.407 line:95%,end
Don't worry about her.

00:15:41.473 --> 00:15:43.709 line:95%,end
I don't anybody said anything...

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:45.477 line:95%,end
I don't think, offensive.

00:15:45.544 --> 00:15:47.279 line:95%,end
We just asked why she wasn't wearing it.

00:15:48.113 --> 00:15:50.849 line:95%,end
We all have meltdowns,
and she runs to Abby.

00:15:50.916 --> 00:15:51.917 line:95%,end
Because that's her protection.

00:15:51.984 --> 00:15:54.720 line:95%,end
I know, and I feel badly,
like, I didn't mean to,

00:15:54.787 --> 00:15:56.422 line:95%,end
I didn't mean to cross that line.

00:15:56.488 --> 00:15:57.823 line:95%,end
Abby's watching us.

00:15:57.890 --> 00:15:58.991 line:95%,end
Maybe...

00:15:59.792 --> 00:16:01.560 line:95%,end
when you get home tonight,

00:16:01.627 --> 00:16:03.796 line:95%,end
or when you have a private moment
with your mothers,

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:06.665 line:95%,end
tell them to keep their mouths shut

00:16:06.732 --> 00:16:08.267 line:95%,end
and stay away from Melissa.

00:16:09.068 --> 00:16:11.136 line:5%,start
The last thing that I need right now

00:16:11.203 --> 00:16:13.105 line:5%,start
is for Melissa to have a meltdown.

00:16:13.172 --> 00:16:15.074 line:95%,end
<i>These girls need to be rehearsing,</i>

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:18.444 line:95%,end
<i>not watching their mothers</i>
<i>act like teenage drama queens.</i>

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:22.247 line:95%,end
There's two things you don't talk about;
weddings and divorces.

00:16:23.182 --> 00:16:24.316 line:95%,end
It's none of their business,

00:16:25.017 --> 00:16:26.752 line:95%,end
and they are causing this trouble.

00:16:27.152 --> 00:16:30.589 line:95%,end
No, we're not,
and don't speak to our children that way.

00:16:30.656 --> 00:16:32.725 line:5%,start
Abby always has to drag
our kids into things.

00:16:32.791 --> 00:16:35.594 line:95%,end
She has no clue
what's appropriate and what's not.

00:16:35.661 --> 00:16:37.396 line:95%,end
<i>Well, here's a clue, if it makes them cry,</i>

00:16:37.463 --> 00:16:38.664 line:95%,end
probably not appropriate.

00:16:38.731 --> 00:16:40.265 line:95%,end
Stop screaming at our kids.

00:16:40.332 --> 00:16:41.633 line:95%,end
(imitates gunshot)

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:42.968 line:95%,end
Don't scream at my kids.

00:16:43.035 --> 00:16:44.503 line:95%,end
Kelly, you're an adult.

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:46.772 line:95%,end
-I don't care. Melissa talks about me...
-Tell them no.

00:16:46.839 --> 00:16:48.073 line:95%,end
and says stuff about me too.

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:50.075 line:95%,end
-Not about your husband.
-KELLY: Yes, she does.

00:16:50.142 --> 00:16:51.477 line:95%,end
And you talk about my mother.

00:16:51.543 --> 00:16:53.212 line:95%,end
So shut up, Abby.

00:16:53.812 --> 00:16:54.947 line:95%,end
We didn't say anything wrong.

00:16:55.014 --> 00:16:57.116 line:5%,start
If you're a friend, you're a friend,

00:16:57.182 --> 00:16:59.351 line:5%,start
and you shouldn't have all these rules
and obligations

00:16:59.418 --> 00:17:01.887 line:95%,end
about what you can say,
and what you can't say,

00:17:01.954 --> 00:17:04.223 line:95%,end
and tiptoeing around everything.

00:17:04.289 --> 00:17:05.257 line:95%,end
She has no clue.

00:17:05.324 --> 00:17:07.226 line:95%,end
-She's talking on misinformation.
-Let's go.

00:17:07.292 --> 00:17:08.827 line:95%,end
We're taking our kids out of this room.

00:17:09.228 --> 00:17:10.963 line:95%,end
Um, Chloe we didn't do anything wrong.

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.131 line:95%,end
Don't listen to Abby.

00:17:12.197 --> 00:17:14.099 line:95%,end
-Go get your stuff.
-HOLLY: And she's fabricating it

00:17:14.166 --> 00:17:15.267 line:95%,end
all along.

00:17:17.036 --> 00:17:20.039 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:26.178 line:95%,end
-Hey.
-Hi.

00:17:26.245 --> 00:17:27.880 line:95%,end
<i>I came back for my girls.</i>

00:17:27.946 --> 00:17:31.183 line:5%,start
I won't let my personal life
interfere with my girl's happiness.

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:32.851 line:95%,end
I knew you wouldn't let Maddie down.

00:17:32.918 --> 00:17:34.753 line:95%,end
-I'm not gonna let my daughter down.
-ABBY: Or me.

00:17:35.621 --> 00:17:37.189 line:5%,start
That is such a crock of (bleep).

00:17:37.256 --> 00:17:38.290 line:5%,start
Melissa came back

00:17:38.357 --> 00:17:40.225 line:95%,end
because she didn't want Abby
to be pissed off,

00:17:40.292 --> 00:17:42.394 line:95%,end
<i>and not be able</i>
<i>to get her daughter ahead anymore.</i>

00:17:42.461 --> 00:17:44.096 line:95%,end
ABBY: Okay. We're ready to go.

00:17:44.163 --> 00:17:45.230 line:95%,end
I'm going to let Giana know.

00:17:45.297 --> 00:17:47.499 line:95%,end
Well, that's not how you talk to us.

00:17:47.566 --> 00:17:49.301 line:95%,end
You talk to us like
we're a bunch of (bleep),,

00:17:49.368 --> 00:17:50.335 line:95%,end
and your sweet to her.

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:52.671 line:95%,end
Well, if the shoe fits wear it.

00:17:52.738 --> 00:17:54.473 line:95%,end
Yeah, well, you need the biggest one.

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:56.942 line:5%,start
ABBY: One, two, three, four,

00:17:57.009 --> 00:17:59.344 line:5%,start
five, six, seven, eight.

00:17:59.411 --> 00:18:02.381 line:95%,end
Girls, we have two days,

00:18:02.448 --> 00:18:04.049 line:95%,end
two days until Company Dance.

00:18:04.116 --> 00:18:06.018 line:95%,end
There's going to be every amazing studio

00:18:06.085 --> 00:18:07.152 line:95%,end
in the Midwest is going to be there.

00:18:07.753 --> 00:18:08.954 line:95%,end
Do you understand that?

00:18:10.055 --> 00:18:11.457 line:95%,end
Come on. Let's get to it.

00:18:11.523 --> 00:18:14.927 line:95%,end
SINGER: <i>âª</i><i>Trapped inside</i>
<i>these fallen walls âª</i>

00:18:14.993 --> 00:18:18.063 line:95%,end
<i>âª</i><i>Waiting for someone to call âª</i>


00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:21.100 line:95%,end
I chose the homeless topic

00:18:21.166 --> 00:18:23.302 line:95%,end
because these girls
in the Abby Lee Dance Company

00:18:23.368 --> 00:18:25.037 line:95%,end
<i>are very fortunate.</i>

00:18:25.104 --> 00:18:27.005 line:95%,end
<i>They all live in beautiful homes.</i>

00:18:27.072 --> 00:18:28.707 line:95%,end
<i>They have everything they need,</i>

00:18:28.774 --> 00:18:31.410 line:95%,end
and a lot of kids their age don't.

00:18:31.477 --> 00:18:34.346 line:95%,end
I'd better see a homeless child

00:18:34.413 --> 00:18:35.647 line:95%,end
that hasn't eaten,

00:18:35.714 --> 00:18:38.450 line:95%,end
that hasn't bathed, in that box.

00:18:38.517 --> 00:18:39.685 line:95%,end
Act it out.

00:18:40.018 --> 00:18:42.020 line:95%,end
And they get you, and they befriend you,

00:18:42.087 --> 00:18:44.123 line:95%,end
and they help you, and they clean you up.

00:18:44.623 --> 00:18:45.958 line:95%,end
You come around.

00:18:46.024 --> 00:18:47.392 line:95%,end
You dance with the girls.

00:18:47.459 --> 00:18:49.528 line:95%,end
And at the end, what do we see?

00:18:49.595 --> 00:18:52.965 line:95%,end
Another homeless child
because the problem still exists.

00:18:54.099 --> 00:18:57.603 line:95%,end
So think about that
when you're in your own bedroom tonight,

00:18:57.669 --> 00:18:59.738 line:95%,end
going to sleep
in your big beautiful house.

00:18:59.805 --> 00:19:00.772 line:95%,end
Yes?

00:19:00.839 --> 00:19:01.874 line:95%,end
<i>All right.</i>

00:19:02.941 --> 00:19:05.544 line:95%,end
Well, girls, I went to lunch with Jill.

00:19:05.611 --> 00:19:06.578 line:95%,end
Why?

00:19:06.645 --> 00:19:08.380 line:95%,end
-Well, I think she's nice. I mean I--
-She left us.

00:19:08.447 --> 00:19:10.682 line:95%,end
Keeping your friends close
and your enemies closer, huh.

00:19:10.749 --> 00:19:13.018 line:5%,start
HOLLY: It's hard for people to understand.
It's my own friendship Melissa.

00:19:13.085 --> 00:19:15.654 line:5%,start
And I think for the dance moms
it's different.

00:19:15.721 --> 00:19:17.956 line:5%,start
It's not like a typical friendship.

00:19:18.323 --> 00:19:20.425 line:95%,end
We have these blowups that occur,

00:19:21.026 --> 00:19:23.529 line:95%,end
<i>Melissa gets angry,</i>
<i>she storms out of the studio,</i>

She really likes it at Candy Apple.

00:19:35.507 --> 00:19:38.343 line:95%,end
She likes it because Kendall's the star

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:40.646 line:95%,end
and they're welcoming
because she didn't walk in

00:19:40.712 --> 00:19:43.182 line:95%,end
and say, my kids better than your kid,
like she did to us.

00:19:43.248 --> 00:19:45.517 line:95%,end
And she said Cathy is so amazing.

00:19:45.584 --> 00:19:47.553 line:95%,end
The fact that she thinks
Cathy is so amazing

00:19:47.619 --> 00:19:49.188 line:95%,end
just speaks volumes on Jill.

00:19:49.254 --> 00:19:51.790 line:95%,end
Well, Cathy is doing so much for Kendall,

00:19:51.857 --> 00:19:54.927 line:95%,end

as a dig, you know, to Abby,

Yep. Cathy was sitting right beside her.

I have a solo this week,

and it's like a lyrical routine,

00:20:27.492 --> 00:20:30.996 line:95%,end

because I'm pretending to be Snow White

00:20:31.063 --> 00:20:33.765 line:95%,end

<i>in the mirror.</i>

impressive resume our judges.

Don't throw your head up.

Come on, girls. Let's go.

00:21:02.594 --> 00:21:04.863 line:5%,start
It's very important that the girls do well

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:06.531 line:5%,start
this week in Chicago.

00:21:06.598 --> 00:21:09.635 line:5%,start
I mean, Company Dance
is a huge convention and competition,

00:21:09.701 --> 00:21:13.538 line:95%,end
and let's face it,
every single judge there knows me.

00:21:13.605 --> 00:21:15.874 line:95%,end
<i>They know the history</i>

This is important to me.

CATHY: Come on Apples. Let's go.

00:21:22.447 --> 00:21:24.783 line:95%,end
Everybody focused on
what we rehearsed last night?

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:26.318 line:95%,end

-Okay. Good.

00:21:26.385 --> 00:21:27.986 line:95%,end

-Yeah.

00:21:28.053 --> 00:21:30.188 line:95%,end
Good. Good, good, good.
Does it feel good to be an Apple?

00:21:30.255 --> 00:21:31.290 line:95%,end
-Yeah.
-Perfect.

Girls the stage is beautiful.

00:21:42.134 --> 00:21:44.636 line:95%,end
You can tell the caliber
is going to be through the roof.

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:47.272 line:95%,end
So I want you going over that trio,

00:21:47.339 --> 00:21:49.474 line:95%,end
and I want you going
over that group dance.

00:21:49.541 --> 00:21:51.009 line:95%,end
Maddie, I'm telling you what?

00:21:51.443 --> 00:21:52.577 line:95%,end
The feet.

00:21:52.644 --> 00:21:54.880 line:95%,end
Concentrate on the placement of your feet.

00:21:54.946 --> 00:21:57.149 line:95%,end
Maddie is going head-to-head with Justice.

00:21:57.215 --> 00:21:59.051 line:95%,end

00:22:03.355 --> 00:22:06.024 line:95%,end
The Abby Lee Dance Company
doesn't like to lose,

00:22:06.091 --> 00:22:08.694 line:95%,end
certainly not to some hick from Ohio.

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:09.828 line:95%,end
Do some stretching.

00:22:09.895 --> 00:22:12.164 line:95%,end
While Justice gets ready
stay out of his way

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:13.365 line:95%,end
so he can concentrate.

00:22:13.432 --> 00:22:15.567 line:5%,start
And I think that Justice
is going to do a great job.

00:22:15.634 --> 00:22:18.837 line:5%,start
I think he's going to force Maddie
to see what happens

00:22:18.904 --> 00:22:21.740 line:95%,end
when a technical boy comes up
and is in their category.

Maddie won.

00:29:09.748 --> 00:29:12.717 line:95%,end

-Oh, yeah.
-This is where we're going.

00:29:28.099 --> 00:29:30.168 line:95%,end
We have a few hours to kill
before the next number,

00:29:30.235 --> 00:29:33.438 line:95%,end
so we left the girls with Abby
and we went out for a mom's lunch.

00:29:33.505 --> 00:29:35.140 line:95%,end
Where's Melissa?
Why didn't she come with us?

00:29:36.141 --> 00:29:37.408 line:95%,end
You know?

00:29:37.475 --> 00:29:38.943 line:95%,end
What are we going to do about her?

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:40.712 line:5%,start
Melissa has been very on edge lately.

00:29:40.779 --> 00:29:43.014 line:5%,start
She still won't talk about her engagement,

00:29:43.081 --> 00:29:45.350 line:95%,end
and then there was that
whole blowup at the studio.

00:29:45.416 --> 00:29:47.652 line:95%,end
It's just--the whole thing
is just very uncomfortable.

00:29:47.719 --> 00:29:49.754 line:95%,end
I just never know where I stand.

00:29:49.821 --> 00:29:52.657 line:95%,end
Like, do I say this?
Do I not say that?

00:29:52.724 --> 00:29:54.959 line:95%,end
I don't think I say anything
particularly offensive.

00:29:55.026 --> 00:29:57.262 line:95%,end
-Well.
-HOLLY: I'm just confused.

00:29:57.328 --> 00:29:58.496 line:95%,end
Can we discuss?

00:29:58.563 --> 00:30:00.165 line:95%,end
About beating around the bush?

00:30:00.231 --> 00:30:02.333 line:95%,end
I'm not going to beat around the bush.
I'm going to ask you flat out.

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.402 line:95%,end
Did you people get a letter too?

00:30:04.469 --> 00:30:06.371 line:95%,end
Okay, I was waiting for someone
to bring up the letter.

00:30:06.437 --> 00:30:09.340 line:95%,end
<i>All of the moms received a letter</i>
<i>from an attorney saying,</i>

00:30:09.407 --> 00:30:11.109 line:95%,end
<i>"To cease and desist discussion</i>

00:30:11.176 --> 00:30:12.911 line:95%,end
of Melissa's personal life."

00:30:12.977 --> 00:30:15.146 line:95%,end
What attorney would pen that letter?

00:30:15.213 --> 00:30:16.514 line:95%,end
You got a letter?
You got a letter?

00:30:16.581 --> 00:30:18.783 line:95%,end
I'm just glad that I wasn't
the only person that got the letter.

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:21.052 line:95%,end
I can't believe that she sent
a letter to all of us

00:30:21.119 --> 00:30:24.522 line:95%,end
from an attorney that was hired
to say that we're not allowed

00:30:24.589 --> 00:30:25.890 line:95%,end
to discuss her personal life.

00:30:25.957 --> 00:30:27.892 line:95%,end
-And she's supposed to be our friend.
-Who does that?

00:30:27.959 --> 00:30:29.894 line:95%,end
What friend sends you a letter
from an attorney?

00:30:29.961 --> 00:30:32.664 line:95%,end
And then, if you do talk about it,
she threatens to sue you.

00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:34.766 line:95%,end
-Like, friends don't sue friends.
-Nope.

00:30:34.833 --> 00:30:36.768 line:95%,end
-She talks about sex like it's nothing...
-We talk about it (indistinct)

00:30:36.835 --> 00:30:38.436 line:95%,end
...but apparently marriage is taboo.

00:30:38.503 --> 00:30:39.571 line:95%,end
I thought it was backwards.

00:30:39.637 --> 00:30:41.139 line:95%,end
I didn't think it was off limits.

00:30:41.206 --> 00:30:43.074 line:95%,end
-Nobody sues somebody else about...
-HOLLY: No one does that.

00:30:43.141 --> 00:30:45.310 line:95%,end
-...talking about a normal thing.
-Yeah.

00:30:45.376 --> 00:30:47.445 line:95%,end
My feelings are really hurt by this.

00:30:47.512 --> 00:30:50.148 line:95%,end
I mean, I've been friends
with Melissa for a long time,

00:30:50.215 --> 00:30:52.550 line:95%,end
<i>and I love her kids</i>
<i>like they're my own.</i>

00:30:53.117 --> 00:30:54.886 line:95%,end
All's I wanted to do was talk to her

00:30:55.286 --> 00:30:57.355 line:95%,end
<i>and find out what the problem was.</i>

00:30:57.422 --> 00:30:58.423 line:95%,end
I mean, I'm confused.

00:30:58.489 --> 00:31:00.625 line:95%,end
She only wants people
to see one side of her.

00:31:00.692 --> 00:31:03.161 line:95%,end
If anybody knows the true Melissa,
it's us.

00:31:03.461 --> 00:31:06.064 line:95%,end
We've seen all sides of Melissa.

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:07.565 line:95%,end
The good, the bad,
and the sneaky.

00:31:08.066 --> 00:31:10.001 line:95%,end
Well, I'm incredibly offended by that.
I'm upset.

00:31:10.068 --> 00:31:12.003 line:95%,end
I think we should say something
to her about it

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:13.037 line:95%,end
when she comes in.

00:31:13.104 --> 00:31:14.172 line:95%,end
-I mean...
-I think we should.

00:31:14.239 --> 00:31:17.041 line:95%,end
...that's not something you just brush
under the rug and don't discuss.

00:31:17.108 --> 00:31:18.243 line:95%,end
We need to confront her.

00:31:18.309 --> 00:31:19.811 line:95%,end
I wonder if she's going
to walk in here chipper,

00:31:19.878 --> 00:31:21.279 line:95%,end
like nothing's ever happened.

00:31:21.346 --> 00:31:24.582 line:95%,end
Then come in and have lunch
with three people just sued,

00:31:24.649 --> 00:31:26.584 line:95%,end
-and act like everything's normal.
-CHRISTI: She didn't sue us.

00:31:26.651 --> 00:31:27.852 line:95%,end
She threatened to sue us.

00:31:27.919 --> 00:31:29.587 line:95%,end
Okay, she threatened to sue us.

00:31:29.654 --> 00:31:30.622 line:95%,end
I mean, really.

00:31:30.688 --> 00:31:31.923 line:95%,end
Here's Melissa coming now.

00:31:33.925 --> 00:31:35.894 line:95%,end
-Hi, guys.
-Hey.

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:38.263 line:95%,end
I was in a rush
and I was running late.

00:31:38.329 --> 00:31:40.265 line:95%,end
I just need a drink.
Drink, drink, drink.

00:31:40.331 --> 00:31:42.834 line:95%,end
Well, we have to bring up
an awkward subject, Melissa.

00:31:42.901 --> 00:31:43.902 line:95%,end
MELISSA: What?

00:31:44.869 --> 00:31:46.004 line:95%,end
The letter.

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:46.938 line:95%,end
What letter?

00:31:49.874 --> 00:31:52.076 line:95%,end
From the attorney that we all got.

00:31:52.143 --> 00:31:54.078 line:95%,end
It wasn't for me.
It's from his attorney.

00:31:54.145 --> 00:31:55.113 line:95%,end
-Okay.
-Not my attorney.

00:31:55.179 --> 00:31:57.282 line:95%,end
As Melissa's saying,
"Oh, I didn't send that letter."

00:31:57.348 --> 00:31:58.483 line:95%,end
I don't know what that letter is.

00:31:58.549 --> 00:31:59.984 line:95%,end
It's typical Melissa behavior.

00:32:00.051 --> 00:32:02.287 line:95%,end
<i>She never takes responsibility</i>
<i>for her own actions,</i>

00:32:02.353 --> 00:32:03.588 line:95%,end
and she deflects onto something else.

00:32:03.655 --> 00:32:05.456 line:95%,end
It wasn't me.
I didn't do it.

00:32:05.523 --> 00:32:06.557 line:95%,end
I just felt some betrayal.

00:32:06.624 --> 00:32:07.825 line:95%,end
-I'll just be honest because I'm like...
-That's fine.

00:32:07.892 --> 00:32:11.396 line:95%,end
...I cannot believe, Melissa,
you were that upset that you--

00:32:11.462 --> 00:32:13.131 line:95%,end
that I would get something
from an attorney.

00:32:13.197 --> 00:32:14.666 line:95%,end
But, like I said,
I didn't send it.
