WOMAN: Your first day.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.045 line:5%,start
My first day.

00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:13.880 line:5%,start
Your reputation precedes you.

00:00:13.947 --> 00:00:16.950 line:5%,start
ABBY: You save those tears
for your pillow in your room, alone.

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:19.319 line:5%,start
You know what? The kid needs somebody.

00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:21.354 line:5%,start
-She's not that swift.
-How dare you?

00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:22.822 line:5%,start
Girls, you have to get it together.

00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:24.724 line:5%,start
How come I'm the only one
who gets aggravated?

00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:27.127 line:5%,start
KELLY: Because you're the only
that hasn't had a child.

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:32.399 line:5%,start
No, but I had a mother and a father,
and if they looked at me one time, I knew.

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:34.367 line:5%,start
Oh, don't even go there, you whore.

ABBY: This is about you
getting an Abby Lee Dance Company jacket

JILL: You think those girls were nine
and ten years old?

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:57.791 line:5%,start
ABBY: No, I don't think
they were nine and 10,

00:00:57.857 --> 00:00:58.691 line:5%,start
and I'm a little worried.

00:00:58.758 --> 00:01:00.193 line:5%,start
I think you should be worried too.

<i>they were sloppy.</i>

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:28.655 line:95%,end

a little bit about the dance troupe

00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:41.334 line:95%,end
Obviously, cute still works
in the Carolinas.

00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:43.503 line:95%,end
Kendall, you did your solo.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:44.404 line:95%,end
Scared to death.

00:01:44.471 --> 00:01:47.807 line:95%,end
That face was not an Abby Lee Miller face,
that's for certain.

00:01:47.874 --> 00:01:49.109 line:95%,end
Well, Abby, that was her first time.

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:51.144 line:95%,end
Uh-oh, pssh, we don't get to talk.

00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:52.312 line:95%,end
It's my turn.

This weekend,
we are headed to Columbus, Ohio.

You know who lives in Ohio?

00:01:58.818 --> 00:02:00.753 line:95%,end
Candy Apples.

CHRISTI: Cathy...

00:02:07.427 --> 00:02:09.262 line:95%,end
You guys.

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:11.464 line:5%,start
She's like a cold sore
that just keeps coming back.

00:02:11.531 --> 00:02:13.166 line:5%,start
Like, "I'm here, I'm here, I'm here."

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:15.602 line:95%,end
And you're like, "God, go away already."

00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:17.604 line:95%,end
I don't want any squawking
between the mothers.

00:02:18.404 --> 00:02:20.039 line:95%,end
You all on the same team,

00:02:20.106 --> 00:02:22.408 line:95%,end

out of that big apple.

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:24.944 line:95%,end

(dramatic music playing)

00:02:25.945 --> 00:02:28.848 line:95%,end
ABBY: On the bottom, Kendall.

00:02:28.915 --> 00:02:30.049 line:95%,end
You are on probation.

00:02:30.116 --> 00:02:32.519 line:95%,end
That means that I am watching you
like a hawk.

00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:33.720 line:95%,end
Do you understand me?

00:02:33.786 --> 00:02:36.422 line:5%,start
KENDALL: I'm really sad
that I'm at the bottom of the pyramid,

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:37.957 line:5%,start
because I thought I did my best.

00:02:38.024 --> 00:02:41.161 line:95%,end
Mackenzie, I keep giving you little parts.

00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:44.664 line:95%,end
<i>Your dancing is not up to where</i>
<i>the rest of the girls are.</i>

00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:47.901 line:95%,end
When Maddie was seven,
she could have done the choreography.

00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:51.838 line:95%,end
Brooke, you knew the number,
but the crying and the hysteria...

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:54.941 line:95%,end
<i>that's not a young adult.</i>

00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:57.977 line:95%,end
Paige, you did a nice job this weekend.

00:02:58.044 --> 00:03:01.748 line:95%,end
Then on the bus coming home,
we told you to sit down 32 times.

00:03:02.415 --> 00:03:03.349 line:95%,end
I counted.

00:03:03.416 --> 00:03:04.884 line:95%,end
That's 31 too many.

00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:06.319 line:95%,end
Every single one of them
were playing on the bus.

00:03:06.386 --> 00:03:07.620 line:95%,end
But it doesn't make it right.

00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:10.657 line:95%,end
-She's your daughter.
-You should yell at them too.

00:03:10.723 --> 00:03:11.824 line:5%,start
No matter what I do,

00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:14.160 line:5%,start
my kids are always going to be
at the bottom of the pyramid.

00:03:14.227 --> 00:03:16.496 line:95%,end
I just think it's Abby's
way of torturing me.

00:03:17.463 --> 00:03:19.599 line:95%,end
ABBY: Nia, I left you here
in the same spot

00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:21.034 line:95%,end
that you were in last week.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.438 line:95%,end
Maybe somebody Nia's family
could show up at the competition

00:03:25.505 --> 00:03:26.673 line:95%,end
and watch her and clap for her.

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.508 line:95%,end
Next, we have Chloe.

00:03:28.575 --> 00:03:30.577 line:95%,end
Chloe, you did a great job.

00:03:30.643 --> 00:03:32.812 line:95%,end
And at the top of the pyramid is Maddie.

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.114 line:95%,end
You did a great job,
I've seen you dance better.

00:03:35.181 --> 00:03:38.218 line:95%,end
I want you to be exactly where you were
in Lake Tahoe.

00:03:38.284 --> 00:03:41.020 line:95%,end
Every single person
is going to be in the group dance.

00:03:41.087 --> 00:03:43.957 line:95%,end
It is called Bad Apples.

00:03:44.023 --> 00:03:45.325 line:95%,end
(laughter)

00:03:45.391 --> 00:03:48.528 line:95%,end
ABBY: It's a little '40's,
has a little novelty,

00:03:48.595 --> 00:03:50.964 line:95%,end
but it's a little Katie Perry.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.065 line:95%,end
It's a little ticked up.

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:54.701 line:95%,end
So I want to pin-up girl look.

00:03:54.767 --> 00:03:57.170 line:95%,end
We have the wrap, we have the snood.

00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:59.272 line:95%,end
MACKENZIE: <i>I'm not putting a wrap</i>
<i>in my hair.</i>

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:00.707 line:5%,start
And a snood?

00:04:00.773 --> 00:04:01.841 line:5%,start
What's a snood?

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:04.711 line:95%,end
If you don't know what a wrap
or a snood is, go Google it,

00:04:04.777 --> 00:04:05.645 line:95%,end
figure it out.

00:04:05.712 --> 00:04:08.147 line:95%,end
When you go on stage for that competition,

00:04:08.214 --> 00:04:09.916 line:95%,end
you better be on fire.

00:04:09.983 --> 00:04:12.585 line:95%,end
Brooke, you're doing a solo.

00:04:12.652 --> 00:04:16.222 line:95%,end
Cathy has a girl entered your age.

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.958 line:95%,end
I want you to make applesauce
out of that kid.

00:04:19.025 --> 00:04:21.394 line:95%,end
Backstage, freak that kid out.

00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:24.230 line:95%,end
I want that kid in tears
before she ever steps on that stage.

00:04:25.164 --> 00:04:28.701 line:95%,end
All right, Candy Apples, applesauce.

00:04:29.502 --> 00:04:30.970 line:95%,end
Squish 'em.

00:04:31.037 --> 00:04:33.039 line:95%,end
All right moms, you're dismissed.

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:34.240 line:95%,end
Girls, spread apart.

00:04:34.307 --> 00:04:36.743 line:95%,end
Let's up and start doing the number.
Let's go.

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:37.877 line:95%,end
Music.

00:04:38.678 --> 00:04:39.712 line:5%,start
WOMAN: How're you?

00:04:40.813 --> 00:04:42.015 line:95%,end
WOMAN: Good Lord.

00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:44.150 line:95%,end
WOMAN: I just want to say, stand up tall.

00:04:44.217 --> 00:04:46.352 line:95%,end
WOMAN: So what did you think
of your first pyramid?

00:04:47.053 --> 00:04:49.422 line:95%,end
Yeah, you never know.
I didn't know what to expect.

00:04:49.489 --> 00:04:52.558 line:95%,end
I really didn't think
she'd be on the bottom.

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:53.926 line:95%,end
-Mackenzie--
-It's because you're new.

00:04:53.993 --> 00:04:55.995 line:95%,end
I know, I--I know.

00:04:56.062 --> 00:04:59.766 line:95%,end
But still, I thought that was
a lot of pressure on a little kid.


00:04:59.832 --> 00:05:02.001 line:95%,end
Kendall absolutely should be
on the bottom of that pyramid.

00:05:02.068 --> 00:05:03.970 line:95%,end
I think Kendall should take up
permanent residency

00:05:04.037 --> 00:05:04.904 line:95%,end
<i>at the bottom of the pyramid.</i>

00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:07.507 line:95%,end
We've been dealing with this one
for a long time.

00:05:07.573 --> 00:05:09.809 line:95%,end
<i>You've got like three days</i>
<i>under your belt, sister.</i>

00:05:09.876 --> 00:05:11.210 line:95%,end
<i>Get used to the bottom row.</i>

00:05:11.277 --> 00:05:13.179 line:5%,start
I do this.

00:05:13.246 --> 00:05:14.380 line:5%,start
Big.

00:05:15.348 --> 00:05:16.416 line:95%,end
Little.

00:05:17.383 --> 00:05:21.554 line:95%,end
The number we're doing for a Rising Star
is called the Bad Apples.

00:05:21.621 --> 00:05:23.956 line:95%,end
<i>It's a 1940s number.</i>

00:05:24.023 --> 00:05:26.392 line:95%,end
<i>A little Andrews Sisters,</i>
<i>a little Katie Perry.</i>

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:30.463 line:95%,end
And also a little jab to Cathy
from Candy Apple.

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.434 line:95%,end
In three days she learned a solo,
they switched the music the night before.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.968 line:95%,end
That's what we do every week.

00:05:36.035 --> 00:05:37.637 line:95%,end
WOMAN: My kid still has no music.

00:05:37.704 --> 00:05:39.806 line:95%,end
I just don't understand why

00:05:39.872 --> 00:05:42.175 line:95%,end
she couldn't have thrown her
a little bone.

00:05:42.241 --> 00:05:44.644 line:5%,start
Jill was up there bitching,
because Kendall was at the bottom.

00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:45.645 line:95%,end
<i>I just don't get it.</i>

00:05:45.712 --> 00:05:48.948 line:95%,end
<i>I've been in Abby's studio for 30 years,</i>
<i>and my kids are always at the bottom.</i>

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:50.650 line:95%,end
<i>She's already starting off on a bad foot.</i>

00:05:50.717 --> 00:05:54.253 line:95%,end
I don't think it's fair for her
to put a new kid

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.358 line:95%,end
<i>who did a solo and did well</i>
<i>at the bottom of the pyramid.</i>

00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.427 line:95%,end
KELLY: But do you think it's okay
for a kid who's been here for nine years

00:06:01.494 --> 00:06:03.096 line:95%,end
to be at the bottom of the pyramid?

00:06:03.162 --> 00:06:07.667 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Basically Nia, Chloe, or Maddie
have to be bumped down

00:06:07.734 --> 00:06:10.503 line:95%,end
in order for it to be okay
is what I'm hearing.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:14.006 line:95%,end
-Well, sort of.
-HOLLY: That's what I'm hearing.

00:06:14.073 --> 00:06:18.611 line:5%,start
In order for Kendall to go up,
someone on top has to go down.

00:06:19.145 --> 00:06:20.213 line:5%,start
Who has to go down?

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:21.247 line:95%,end
Is it Nia?

00:06:21.314 --> 00:06:22.348 line:95%,end
<i>Is it Chloe?</i>

00:06:22.415 --> 00:06:23.416 line:95%,end
<i>Is it Maddie?</i>

00:06:23.483 --> 00:06:27.720 line:95%,end
I had an idea of who she suspects
should be at the bottom of the pyramid.

00:06:27.787 --> 00:06:30.523 line:95%,end
-It's so subjective.
-Do you think Kendall's better than Nia?

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.925 line:95%,end
Well, I think had Kendall
and competed directly

00:06:32.992 --> 00:06:35.595 line:95%,end
against each other, I do.

00:06:35.661 --> 00:06:38.998 line:95%,end
I mean, that's just--
I'm just being honest, Holly.

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:41.501 line:5%,start
MELISSA: Kendall was the star
at her studio,

00:06:41.567 --> 00:06:42.802 line:95%,end
<i>and now she's not the star.</i>

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:45.271 line:95%,end
And I think that's really
hard for Jill to handle.

00:06:45.338 --> 00:06:47.573 line:95%,end
You say you want to be accepted
and you want to be part of the group,

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.308 line:95%,end
but then you come in here and--

00:06:49.375 --> 00:06:50.610 line:95%,end
look, you can't lay down the gauntlet

00:06:50.676 --> 00:06:52.745 line:95%,end
saying my kid's better
than all of your kids.

00:06:52.812 --> 00:06:55.081 line:95%,end
I kind of think of this group
as a little bit like a sorority.

00:06:55.148 --> 00:06:58.151 line:95%,end
Like you pledge a little bit,
you kind of like, you sit back,

00:06:58.217 --> 00:07:00.253 line:95%,end
you pay your dues,
and then you get to the top.

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:03.022 line:95%,end
Like I don't think you can come in here
expecting to be like,

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:04.991 line:95%,end
boom I'm at the top because I say so.

00:07:05.057 --> 00:07:07.126 line:95%,end
-I think she deserves it.
-(interposing voices)

00:07:07.193 --> 00:07:08.060 line:95%,end
We all work.

00:07:08.127 --> 00:07:10.963 line:95%,end
I can't worry about your kids,
I've got to worry about mine.

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:12.098 line:95%,end
Don't worry about my daughter.

00:07:12.165 --> 00:07:14.534 line:95%,end
I'm just telling you,
she's not going to give you everything,

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.735 line:95%,end
because she doesn't give me everything,

00:07:15.802 --> 00:07:17.870 line:95%,end
and I've been here
a whole hell of a lot longer than you.

00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:19.906 line:95%,end
So wait a minute,
you're in your honeymoon period.

00:07:19.972 --> 00:07:21.941 line:95%,end
You probably could get away with
talking to her,

00:07:22.008 --> 00:07:24.010 line:95%,end
where the rest of us can never say a word.

00:07:24.076 --> 00:07:26.746 line:95%,end
You might be able to get her ear
and, like--and speak your piece.

00:07:26.813 --> 00:07:28.881 line:95%,end
Do I interrupt this class?

00:07:29.715 --> 00:07:32.018 line:95%,end
I suggested that Jill go down
and talk to Abby,

00:07:32.084 --> 00:07:34.320 line:95%,end
because I think everyone needs
a little initiation

00:07:34.387 --> 00:07:35.688 line:95%,end
when you join our group,

00:07:35.755 --> 00:07:37.690 line:95%,end
and the best way to get that
is to go right in there

00:07:37.757 --> 00:07:39.192 line:95%,end
and tell Abby Miller how you feel.

00:07:39.258 --> 00:07:42.094 line:95%,end
Hold eight, flick at one.
Point your feet, Mackenzie.

00:07:42.161 --> 00:07:45.164 line:95%,end
(dramatic music playing)

00:07:48.167 --> 00:07:50.136 line:95%,end
ABBY: Ready? Go, move!

00:07:50.203 --> 00:07:51.604 line:95%,end
JILL: Abby, I need to talk to you.

00:07:51.671 --> 00:07:53.773 line:95%,end
Can we have two minutes? Two minutes?

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.241 line:95%,end
ABBY: You shouldn't even be in here
with those shoes on.

00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:58.911 line:95%,end
Jill doesn't understand how
the dynamics in my studio work.

00:07:58.978 --> 00:08:00.880 line:95%,end
<i>She's been at this a long time.</i>

00:08:00.947 --> 00:08:04.250 line:95%,end
<i>She spends thousands of dollars</i>
<i>on competition entrance fees</i>

00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:08.488 line:95%,end
when she should have been spending
all that money on technique classes.

00:08:08.554 --> 00:08:10.957 line:95%,end
Does anybody have any popcorn?
(makes sound)

00:08:11.023 --> 00:08:12.959 line:95%,end
ABBY: You really need to go
stay with other mothers.

00:08:13.025 --> 00:08:15.862 line:95%,end
JILL: I just wanted to talk to you
about Kendall.

00:08:15.928 --> 00:08:16.762 line:95%,end
Give me a minute.

00:08:16.829 --> 00:08:18.264 line:95%,end
ABBY: Maddie, (indistinct)

00:08:19.999 --> 00:08:21.801 line:95%,end
-We've played by your rules.
-Right?

00:08:21.868 --> 00:08:25.238 line:95%,end
I'm a little disappointed that
Kendall's at the bottom of the pyramid.

00:08:25.304 --> 00:08:28.341 line:95%,end
Abby, I need to know
what you need for me to get her up.

00:08:28.407 --> 00:08:30.409 line:95%,end
I don't need anything from you.

00:08:30.476 --> 00:08:32.111 line:95%,end
(dramatic music playing)

00:08:32.178 --> 00:08:34.313 line:95%,end
Ladies, I didn't hear anybody counting.

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:37.183 line:95%,end
One, and two, and three, and four and.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:38.885 line:95%,end
Look at her feet,
they're not even together.

00:08:39.819 --> 00:08:41.587 line:95%,end
Look at her feet,
they're still not together.

00:08:41.654 --> 00:08:43.122 line:95%,end
Kendall, squeeze your feet, honey.

00:08:43.189 --> 00:08:46.859 line:95%,end
-Put your ankles together.
-We can't have honey, honey, honey.

00:08:46.926 --> 00:08:48.828 line:95%,end
-Leave it up to me.
-I will.

00:08:48.895 --> 00:08:51.397 line:95%,end
-She will sink, or she will swim.
-And I'm counting on you.

00:08:51.464 --> 00:08:53.666 line:95%,end
-Right.
-And I have faith on you.

00:08:53.733 --> 00:08:56.068 line:95%,end
You're going to pay a lot of money
to go to Harvard.

00:08:56.135 --> 00:08:59.705 line:95%,end
Someone's going to be the valedictorian,
and thousands of other people aren't.

00:09:00.439 --> 00:09:02.675 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>I liked watching Abby</i>
<i>shut Jill down,</i>

00:09:02.742 --> 00:09:05.678 line:95%,end
<i>just because Jill definitely</i>
<i>has ulterior motives.</i>

00:09:05.745 --> 00:09:07.380 line:95%,end
I think she'll do anything
to get Kendall ahead.

00:09:07.446 --> 00:09:09.348 line:95%,end
Does everyone wants to
be at the top of pyramid?

00:09:09.815 --> 00:09:10.883 line:95%,end
ALL: Yes.

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:11.851 line:95%,end
Well...

00:09:12.785 --> 00:09:13.819 line:95%,end
-Okay?
-All right.

00:09:13.886 --> 00:09:15.788 line:95%,end
-Let's go.
-All right, work it.

00:09:15.855 --> 00:09:18.457 line:95%,end
(dramatic music playing)

00:09:22.128 --> 00:09:25.231 line:95%,end
CATHY: Now is the time for us
to show our technique.

00:09:25.298 --> 00:09:28.234 line:95%,end
Keep our toes pointed, straight knees,
keep everything nice and tight.

00:09:28.301 --> 00:09:29.168 line:95%,end
We're going to get busy.

00:09:29.835 --> 00:09:33.673 line:95%,end
<i>I haven't seen any of the dance moms</i>
<i>since we came back from LA,</i>

00:09:33.739 --> 00:09:36.208 line:5%,start
and LA was really humiliating for me.

00:09:36.275 --> 00:09:40.246 line:5%,start
But you know, I had to brush myself off
and get a game plan.

00:09:40.313 --> 00:09:44.350 line:95%,end
And when the dance moms
from Abby Lee Dance Center see us,

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:46.018 line:95%,end
<i>they are going to be blown away.</i>

00:09:46.085 --> 00:09:47.787 line:95%,end
Higher! Higher! Higher!

00:09:47.853 --> 00:09:50.489 line:95%,end
Yeah, see, that's beautiful?


00:09:52.725 --> 00:09:55.795 line:5%,start
(dramatic music playing)

00:09:56.829 --> 00:09:57.697 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>How about Jill?</i>

00:09:57.763 --> 00:10:00.199 line:95%,end
Uh, being mad that Kendall's
at the bottom of the pyramid.

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:02.568 line:95%,end
-I know.
-Hello, you're brand new.

00:10:02.635 --> 00:10:05.938 line:95%,end
Oh, I'm a team player,
but I can't worry about your girls.

00:10:06.005 --> 00:10:07.106 line:5%,start
Kelly and I are at lunch,

00:10:07.173 --> 00:10:09.642 line:5%,start
and of course, the main topic
of conversation is the new girl.

00:10:09.709 --> 00:10:10.776 line:95%,end
Oh.

00:10:12.078 --> 00:10:14.080 line:95%,end
I forgot, I brought something to show you.

00:10:14.146 --> 00:10:15.348 line:95%,end
(dramatic music playing)

00:10:15.414 --> 00:10:18.484 line:95%,end
I have a book from a competition
from a few years ago.

00:10:18.551 --> 00:10:19.585 line:95%,end
Oh, you're kidding me.

00:10:19.652 --> 00:10:21.387 line:95%,end
Uh-uh, because I keep my books.

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:24.023 line:95%,end
Chloe, Maddie, and Kendall
all danced in the same age group

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:25.625 line:95%,end
against one another solos.

00:10:25.691 --> 00:10:30.062 line:95%,end
And Jill never remembered
our girls beating her daughter.

00:10:30.129 --> 00:10:31.530 line:95%,end
I remember.

00:10:31.597 --> 00:10:35.868 line:95%,end
Chloe was actually three,
Maddie was one, Kendall was ten.

00:10:36.936 --> 00:10:38.638 line:95%,end
Are you going to take that
and show her tonight?

00:10:38.704 --> 00:10:40.406 line:95%,end
-I might.
-KELLY: Oh, I think you should.

00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:41.874 line:95%,end
She doesn't know what she's messing with,

00:10:41.941 --> 00:10:44.343 line:95%,end
because I've got these books
from years back.

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:46.545 line:95%,end
So if she wants to play that game,
I'll pull them all out.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.383 line:95%,end
I think there's more to Jill's story
than meets the eye.

00:10:50.449 --> 00:10:52.618 line:95%,end
I think that we all need to do
a little digging

00:10:52.685 --> 00:10:55.187 line:95%,end
and find out why she's a studio hopper

00:10:55.254 --> 00:10:57.156 line:95%,end
and why all of a sudden
she's knocking on our door

00:10:57.223 --> 00:10:59.592 line:95%,end
when she's lived
down the street from us for years.

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:02.261 line:95%,end
I there's a lot to be learned about Jill.

00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:04.697 line:95%,end
And I think it's better to know

00:11:04.764 --> 00:11:07.033 line:95%,end
what you're dealing with
than to be blindsided.

00:11:07.099 --> 00:11:09.635 line:95%,end
Anyone who talks like this all the time...

00:11:10.269 --> 00:11:12.638 line:95%,end
<i>just can't be trusted.</i>

00:11:13.539 --> 00:11:16.842 line:5%,start
(pop music playing)

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:22.548 line:5%,start
ABBY: <i>Brooke's routine, Garden of Eden,</i>

00:11:22.615 --> 00:11:24.583 line:5%,start
is a lyrical acrobatic routine,

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:26.352 line:95%,end
<i>and she's really going to</i>
<i>impress the judges.</i>

00:11:26.419 --> 00:11:28.087 line:95%,end
<i>She's going to leave</i>
<i>everybody wanting more.</i>

00:11:28.154 --> 00:11:31.524 line:95%,end
That head is like the drop. What is that?

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:35.761 line:95%,end
The word on the street is that
Cathy has entered somebody

00:11:35.828 --> 00:11:39.398 line:95%,end
directly against Brooke
as far as age goes.

00:11:39.465 --> 00:11:44.804 line:95%,end
So Brooke needs to go out there
and show everybody that she is flawless.

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:46.405 line:95%,end
(dramatic music playing)

00:11:46.472 --> 00:11:50.009 line:95%,end
CATHY: As you know, we've just added
the Abby Lee Dance Company

00:11:50.076 --> 00:11:53.145 line:95%,end
as part of our repertoire of enemies.

00:11:53.212 --> 00:11:55.681 line:95%,end
And particularly Brooke.

00:11:55.748 --> 00:11:58.684 line:95%,end
Brooke is a title winner just like you.

00:11:58.751 --> 00:12:00.820 line:95%,end
Is she a two time title winner like you?

00:12:00.886 --> 00:12:01.754 line:95%,end
No.

00:12:01.821 --> 00:12:04.690 line:5%,start
I think that my main message to Abby is

00:12:04.757 --> 00:12:08.894 line:95%,end
<i>yes, she's a very good dance studio,</i>
<i>and so are we.</i>

00:12:08.961 --> 00:12:11.897 line:95%,end
You're wondering what's going on, head.

00:12:11.964 --> 00:12:15.367 line:95%,end
Is Abby the only person that
has a dance studio that is successful?

00:12:15.434 --> 00:12:16.268 line:95%,end
No.

00:12:16.335 --> 00:12:19.705 line:95%,end
Cathy has a dance studio
that's very successful too.

00:12:19.772 --> 00:12:22.475 line:95%,end
Brooke over here, I think her forte

00:12:22.541 --> 00:12:25.711 line:95%,end
is like laying on the floor

00:12:25.778 --> 00:12:28.080 line:95%,end
and then crawling around on her neck.

00:12:28.147 --> 00:12:32.685 line:95%,end
But you, on the other hand,
have these amazing combination pirouettes.

00:12:32.752 --> 00:12:36.555 line:95%,end
And Miss Vivi,
Erika is going to look at you,

00:12:36.622 --> 00:12:37.890 line:95%,end
she's going to look at you.

00:12:37.957 --> 00:12:39.959 line:95%,end
That's your cue, okay?

00:12:40.025 --> 00:12:42.061 line:95%,end
Don't be sitting over here sleeping.

00:12:42.128 --> 00:12:45.030 line:95%,end
You've got to dance like you want a puppy,
you've got to earn your puppy.

00:12:45.097 --> 00:12:46.565 line:95%,end
Now's the time.

00:12:46.632 --> 00:12:48.768 line:95%,end
Okay? That was our deal.

00:12:48.834 --> 00:12:49.668 line:95%,end
Yes?

00:12:49.735 --> 00:12:51.370 line:95%,end
Now's the time to earn our puppy.

00:12:51.437 --> 00:12:52.872 line:95%,end
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.

00:12:52.938 --> 00:12:54.173 line:95%,end
Okay.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:55.141 line:95%,end
We ready?

00:12:58.177 --> 00:12:59.645 line:95%,end
Oh my God, I did that?

00:12:59.712 --> 00:13:00.546 line:95%,end
Yeah.

00:13:03.048 --> 00:13:04.583 line:5%,start
I hope I can still dance.

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:06.285 line:95%,end
CATHY: Okay, let's go.

00:13:06.352 --> 00:13:07.386 line:95%,end
<i>Just a minor tragedy.</i>

00:13:07.453 --> 00:13:09.121 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:13:09.188 --> 00:13:12.258 line:95%,end
(tapping)

00:13:14.093 --> 00:13:16.729 line:5%,start
(upbeat music playing)

00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:19.431 line:95%,end
ABBY: Five, six, seven, eight.

00:13:21.567 --> 00:13:24.003 line:95%,end
Pliet when you land. Turn out, turn out.

00:13:25.404 --> 00:13:28.174 line:95%,end
Oh, my God,
I know what I wanted to show you.

00:13:28.474 --> 00:13:31.977 line:95%,end
I was going through Chloe's shelf,

00:13:32.044 --> 00:13:36.282 line:95%,end
and I found the book from the competition
that we were talking about.

00:13:36.348 --> 00:13:39.285 line:95%,end
-Oh, which one?
-The one that we were saying--yeah.


00:13:39.351 --> 00:13:42.188 line:95%,end
And I have all the scores written down
from that competition.

00:13:42.254 --> 00:13:45.891 line:95%,end
Chloe was third, Maddie was first,
but Kendall was tenth.

00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:46.892 line:95%,end
So...

00:13:46.959 --> 00:13:49.361 line:5%,start
KELLY: Christi brought the program book
to show it to Jill,

00:13:49.428 --> 00:13:52.231 line:5%,start
because she wants her to know,

00:13:52.298 --> 00:13:54.200 line:95%,end
<i>my daughter is going to</i>
<i>be a threat to you.</i>

00:13:54.266 --> 00:13:55.968 line:95%,end
But you don't care about winning.

00:13:56.035 --> 00:13:58.037 line:95%,end
JILL: <i>I'm not going to let them get to me.</i>

00:13:58.103 --> 00:14:01.874 line:5%,start
Even if they're intimidated by me
or my little eight-year-old,

00:14:01.941 --> 00:14:03.108 line:5%,start
I'm going to make it work.

00:14:03.576 --> 00:14:05.244 line:95%,end
-I like these ones.
-Yeah.

00:14:05.311 --> 00:14:07.580 line:95%,end
-You guys want to see the snoods?
-CHRISTI: That's just like starting.

00:14:07.646 --> 00:14:09.281 line:95%,end
Where did you find snoods?

00:14:09.348 --> 00:14:11.517 line:95%,end
-KELLY: Oh, that's the--thatâs the rat.
-Thatâs the rat.

00:14:11.584 --> 00:14:12.451 line:95%,end
KELLY: Ew.

00:14:12.518 --> 00:14:15.187 line:95%,end
I did not want us to be
able to find these things.

00:14:15.588 --> 00:14:17.389 line:95%,end
Abby has us wearing a rat.

00:14:18.057 --> 00:14:21.794 line:95%,end
A rat is a foam thing
that you roll your hair in,

00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:23.696 line:95%,end
and it makes you look
kind of like George Washington.

00:14:23.762 --> 00:14:24.730 line:95%,end
(laughs)

00:14:24.797 --> 00:14:26.265 line:95%,end
The ugliest thing ever.

00:14:26.332 --> 00:14:29.301 line:95%,end
When you saw how ugly those were,
why would you purchase them?

00:14:29.368 --> 00:14:30.202 line:95%,end
JILL: Okay.

00:14:30.269 --> 00:14:32.838 line:95%,end
KELLY: You go, you tell her you looked,
and they didn't have them.

00:14:32.905 --> 00:14:33.839 line:95%,end
Let's go show her.

00:14:33.906 --> 00:14:34.874 line:95%,end
KELLY: Jill needs to learn.

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:36.575 line:95%,end
You just tell Abby,
we don't know where they're at,

00:14:36.642 --> 00:14:38.444 line:95%,end
<i>we can't find them,</i>
<i>and then you don't have to wear them.</i>

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:40.112 line:95%,end
Like, "Oh, if this is what Abby wants,

00:14:40.179 --> 00:14:41.747 line:95%,end
if I get it,
maybe I'll move up the pyramid."

00:14:41.814 --> 00:14:42.648 line:95%,end
Exactly.

00:14:42.715 --> 00:14:44.116 line:95%,end
All the other moms will complain about it.

00:14:44.183 --> 00:14:46.252 line:95%,end
And these two are like, "Do my hair.

00:14:46.318 --> 00:14:47.853 line:95%,end
Are we at a junior high sleepover?

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.022 line:95%,end
-Can you do my hair?"
-(giggling)

00:14:50.089 --> 00:14:52.224 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I think Jill is really
trying to make an effort

00:14:52.291 --> 00:14:55.261 line:95%,end
to appear as a team player at this point,
because it's all she has.

00:14:55.327 --> 00:14:57.429 line:95%,end
<i>She wants to be a member of the team,</i>

00:14:57.496 --> 00:14:59.632 line:95%,end
and her position is very precarious.

00:14:59.698 --> 00:15:01.700 line:95%,end
<i>So I think once she becomes</i>
<i>a member of the team,</i>

00:15:01.767 --> 00:15:04.003 line:95%,end
the tides are going to turn
a little bit with Jill.

00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:07.072 line:95%,end
(upbeat music playing)

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:09.608 line:95%,end
ABBY: Stop!

00:15:11.443 --> 00:15:12.478 line:95%,end
Paige, what are you doing?

00:15:14.246 --> 00:15:15.915 line:95%,end
Okay, let's just go again. Just go again.

00:15:15.981 --> 00:15:18.050 line:95%,end
I'm going to go in
and give my kids the props.

00:15:18.117 --> 00:15:19.885 line:95%,end
And then--oh, can I have the hat?

00:15:19.952 --> 00:15:20.953 line:95%,end
Yes.

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:22.488 line:95%,end
And I'm just going to say--

00:15:22.554 --> 00:15:23.956 line:95%,end
WOMAN: They're lining up, Kell.

00:15:24.023 --> 00:15:26.926 line:95%,end
Maddie, no more stupid mistakes up there.
What are you doing?

00:15:27.593 --> 00:15:29.228 line:95%,end
KELLY: Are they running solos?

00:15:29.295 --> 00:15:31.463 line:95%,end
-ABBY: Yeah.
-I'm going to put these props in here.

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:35.501 line:95%,end
ABBY: Kelly, if she's 13,
let her carry it herself.

00:15:35.567 --> 00:15:37.403 line:95%,end
Next time, you can come up--
she didn't know I brought a hat.

00:15:37.469 --> 00:15:39.905 line:95%,end
Whatever. You're wasting more time.

00:15:39.972 --> 00:15:41.674 line:95%,end
-You want me to run the solos--
-KELLY: Well, you're yelling at me

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:43.242 line:95%,end
for bringing them the stuff
that they need.

00:15:43.309 --> 00:15:46.445 line:95%,end
Do you want us to be hands-on moms?

00:15:46.512 --> 00:15:48.347 line:95%,end
Because you just told Nia
her mom didn't love her.

00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:50.549 line:95%,end
I want you to be gone,

00:15:50.616 --> 00:15:53.686 line:95%,end
and I want to get the two 14-year-olds
that came to the audition

00:15:53.752 --> 00:15:55.454 line:95%,end
-and put them in the dance.
-KELLY: Go ahead! Throw me out!

00:15:55.521 --> 00:15:57.790 line:95%,end
-Throw me out! Go ride ahead.
-ABBY: Go.

00:15:58.657 --> 00:16:02.561 line:95%,end
Kelly has absolutely no right
to interrupt the classroom.

00:16:02.628 --> 00:16:04.730 line:95%,end
<i>Nobody pays that much money.</i>

00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:05.798 line:95%,end
No one.

00:16:13.872 --> 00:16:15.107 line:95%,end
Are you drunk?

00:16:20.312 --> 00:16:22.348 line:95%,end
KELLY: Who the hell is she to ask me
if I'm drinking?

00:16:22.414 --> 00:16:25.584 line:95%,end
-In front of a dance class.
-That's where it crossed a line.

00:16:25.651 --> 00:16:28.020 line:95%,end
That is not correct.

00:16:28.087 --> 00:16:31.090 line:95%,end
Whether I was drinking or not
is none of her damn business.

00:16:31.156 --> 00:16:34.026 line:95%,end
And to say it in front of my children,
that's ridiculous.

00:16:34.093 --> 00:16:36.595 line:95%,end
Watch the glissade. Turn it out!

00:16:36.662 --> 00:16:39.231 line:95%,end
KELLY: She wonders why my kids
want to do other things.

00:16:40.032 --> 00:16:42.801 line:95%,end
I mean would you want to go
to your extracurricular activity

00:16:42.868 --> 00:16:45.738 line:95%,end
and do nothing but get yelled at?

00:16:45.804 --> 00:16:47.373 line:95%,end
I mean, it's supposed to be fun.

00:16:47.439 --> 00:16:48.874 line:95%,end
I was so frustrated.

00:16:48.941 --> 00:16:51.744 line:95%,end
<i>I feel like I should stick up for myself,</i>

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:53.045 line:95%,end
<i>but no matter what I do,</i>

00:16:53.112 --> 00:16:57.116 line:95%,end
<i>she still keeps torturing me</i>
<i>and torturing my kids.</i>

00:16:57.883 --> 00:17:00.686 line:95%,end
<i>I kind of feel, like, I'm between a rock</i>
<i>and a hard place.</i>

00:17:00.753 --> 00:17:04.089 line:95%,end
<i>I want my kids to stay there at the studio</i>
<i>because they love it there,</i>

00:17:04.156 --> 00:17:07.926 line:95%,end
<i>but I'm not doing my job as a mom</i>
<i>by letting her treat them that way.</i>

00:17:07.993 --> 00:17:09.395 line:95%,end
<i>I just can't take it anymore.</i>

00:17:09.461 --> 00:17:11.497 line:95%,end
(tense music playing)

00:17:11.563 --> 00:17:16.468 line:95%,end
I just don't know why
I let my kids do this.

00:17:16.535 --> 00:17:17.669 line:95%,end
I--I can't...

00:17:18.604 --> 00:17:20.239 line:95%,end
I'm torturing my kids.


00:17:24.009 --> 00:17:25.411 line:95%,end
(dramatic music playing)

00:17:25.477 --> 00:17:27.646 line:95%,end
CATHY: One, two, three, four, five, six.

00:17:27.713 --> 00:17:29.915 line:95%,end
One, two, three, four, five, six.

00:17:29.982 --> 00:17:31.617 line:95%,end
Okay, stop.
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

00:17:31.683 --> 00:17:32.618 line:95%,end
I want to talk about that.

00:17:32.684 --> 00:17:36.355 line:95%,end
From you two, I'm getting this.

00:17:36.422 --> 00:17:37.823 line:95%,end
That's not what I want.

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:41.360 line:95%,end
I want the shoulders down
so you would stick your hip out,

00:17:41.427 --> 00:17:44.329 line:95%,end
instead of giving me this
which looks really stupid.

00:17:44.396 --> 00:17:47.533 line:5%,start
I came up with a new plan
to come back with a vengeance.

00:17:47.599 --> 00:17:50.169 line:95%,end
<i>This competition is on my home turf,</i>

00:17:50.235 --> 00:17:52.371 line:95%,end
<i>and those dance moms</i>
<i>aren't going to know what hit them.</i>

00:17:52.438 --> 00:17:53.739 line:95%,end
Stop looking at me.

00:17:53.806 --> 00:17:55.140 line:95%,end
Look at me with your ears.

00:17:55.207 --> 00:17:58.010 line:5%,start
(tense music playing)

00:17:58.077 --> 00:18:00.112 line:5%,start
ABBY: <i>Girls, come on, listen to me.</i>

00:18:00.179 --> 00:18:03.048 line:95%,end
Tomorrow you are leaving for competition,

00:18:03.115 --> 00:18:04.683 line:95%,end
and you're all acting like
a bunch of three-year-olds

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:06.652 line:95%,end
at your first recital costume.

00:18:06.718 --> 00:18:09.855 line:95%,end
Stop, get over there,
and start working on the number.

00:18:09.922 --> 00:18:13.525 line:5%,start
MADDIE: I'm feeling, kind of, happy
that we get to go to Ohio

00:18:13.592 --> 00:18:15.994 line:95%,end
<i>and compete against the Candy Apples.</i>

00:18:16.061 --> 00:18:18.797 line:95%,end
I mean, I don't really care
if we don't win.

00:18:18.864 --> 00:18:21.700 line:95%,end
But I think we will win.

00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:24.036 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Ew, are those our costumes?

00:18:24.103 --> 00:18:26.205 line:95%,end
Not my favorite.

00:18:26.271 --> 00:18:28.107 line:95%,end
Wait till we put the snood on.

00:18:28.173 --> 00:18:30.375 line:95%,end
Oh.

00:18:30.442 --> 00:18:31.910 line:95%,end
Ugly.

00:18:31.977 --> 00:18:33.679 line:95%,end
That's not very Katie Perry.

00:18:33.745 --> 00:18:36.315 line:95%,end
Now we're going to hear a snood and a rat?

00:18:37.382 --> 00:18:41.153 line:5%,start
KELLY: Abby wants us to go
and make applesauce out of the Candy

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:44.656 line:95%,end
<i>but here we are with an ugly costume,</i>
<i>rats and snoods,</i>

00:18:44.723 --> 00:18:46.558 line:95%,end
and we're doing '40's moves.

00:18:46.625 --> 00:18:48.293 line:95%,end
-JILL: You think she'll be rude to me?
-Yes.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.661 line:95%,end
WOMAN: Oh, absolutely.

00:18:49.728 --> 00:18:51.630 line:95%,end
HOLLY: I think it's guilty by association.

00:18:51.697 --> 00:18:54.933 line:95%,end
She'll be like,
you're replacing me in the group.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.172 line:5%,start
I would expect nothing less from Cathy
than her shenanigans that she pulls.

00:19:00.239 --> 00:19:02.141 line:95%,end
I wouldn't be surprised
if she comes backstage

00:19:02.207 --> 00:19:06.145 line:95%,end
and tries to like steal costumes
off of our kids backs that we paid for.

00:19:06.211 --> 00:19:08.447 line:95%,end
Or if she tries to get out of us
what music we're using.

00:19:08.514 --> 00:19:10.649 line:95%,end
Like although those
are last year's tricks.

00:19:10.716 --> 00:19:12.784 line:95%,end
<i>I'm sure she'll have</i>
<i>something new up her sleeve.</i>

00:19:12.851 --> 00:19:14.920 line:95%,end
KELLY: Well, she's after Brooke
this week, so--

00:19:14.987 --> 00:19:16.822 line:95%,end
-WOMAN: Oh.
-WOMAN: No, it's okay.

00:19:16.889 --> 00:19:17.723 line:95%,end
WOMAN: Bring it.

00:19:17.789 --> 00:19:20.792 line:95%,end
(pop music playing)

00:19:21.426 --> 00:19:24.563 line:95%,end
ABBY: Nia, your (indistinct)
instructions--

00:19:26.498 --> 00:19:28.934 line:95%,end
-What's the word?
-What about the world's ugliest costumes?

00:19:29.001 --> 00:19:32.804 line:95%,end
Nothing about that,
but Abby wants Jill and Holly downstairs.

00:19:32.871 --> 00:19:34.273 line:95%,end
Why?

00:19:34.339 --> 00:19:35.974 line:95%,end
Crap. We're going to find out.

00:19:36.441 --> 00:19:38.510 line:5%,start
ABBY: Rehearsals aren't going as well
as I would like.

00:19:38.577 --> 00:19:40.812 line:5%,start
I had to call Holly and Jill down.

00:19:40.879 --> 00:19:43.115 line:95%,end
I wanted them to see with their own eyes

00:19:43.182 --> 00:19:46.952 line:95%,end
what Nia and Kendall keep doing wrong.

00:19:48.153 --> 00:19:50.022 line:95%,end
Watch Nia, watch this show.

00:19:51.723 --> 00:19:53.492 line:95%,end
It's a split jetÃ© change stretch.

00:19:53.559 --> 00:19:55.127 line:95%,end
You see that front foot?

00:19:55.194 --> 00:19:56.428 line:95%,end
Completely flexed.

00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:02.100 line:95%,end
And watch, look at Kendall's--
they never are together.

00:20:02.501 --> 00:20:04.436 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: So did you find
anything out about Jill?

00:20:04.503 --> 00:20:05.404 line:95%,end
Well, I--

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:07.539 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: She's down there.
You can speak freely.

00:20:07.606 --> 00:20:09.741 line:95%,end
Did she mention to you like,
why all of a sudden

00:20:09.808 --> 00:20:11.610 line:95%,end
she decided to come here?

00:20:12.344 --> 00:20:14.112 line:95%,end
She said she's wanted
to come here for years.

00:20:14.746 --> 00:20:16.748 line:95%,end
-But I said, why--
-I don't believe that for one minute.

00:20:16.815 --> 00:20:18.217 line:95%,end
KELLY: She lives down the street,

00:20:18.283 --> 00:20:21.520 line:95%,end
and yet she drove an hour
in each direction.

00:20:22.287 --> 00:20:24.289 line:95%,end
I just think she gets tired of studios.

00:20:24.356 --> 00:20:27.092 line:95%,end
KELLY: Me too, but somehow I stick it out.


00:20:27.159 --> 00:20:28.160 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I don't know,
I've heard some stuff,

00:20:28.227 --> 00:20:30.295 line:95%,end
and I don't think
it's getting tired of studios.

00:20:30.362 --> 00:20:31.530 line:95%,end
-Really? What have you heard?
-If anything, it's--

00:20:35.267 --> 00:20:37.069 line:5%,start
(cheerful music playing)

ABBY: Bus driver Jim,

00:20:44.676 --> 00:20:47.679 line:95%,end
why didn't we jump on the turnpike
and hit 79 the other way

00:20:47.746 --> 00:20:49.548 line:95%,end
so we wouldn't miss all this traffic?

00:20:49.615 --> 00:20:52.050 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>She yells at the bus driver</i>
<i>every time we get on the bus.</i>

00:20:52.117 --> 00:20:54.853 line:95%,end
Apparently, that little navigation system
in front isn't good enough.

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.788 line:95%,end
You need to put Abby Lee Miller
on your dashboard

00:20:56.855 --> 00:20:58.757 line:95%,end
so she can give you the directions.

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:03.929 line:95%,end
MELISSA: <i>Hey, why don't you give Abby</i>
<i>her little gift we got her.</i>

00:21:03.996 --> 00:21:05.931 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: <i>In a shocking turn of events,</i>

00:21:05.998 --> 00:21:08.667 line:95%,end
Melissa and Jill announced
that they went shopping

00:21:08.734 --> 00:21:11.403 line:95%,end
and they bought a gift for Abby,

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:13.472 line:95%,end
because that's what I think about
when I'm shopping,

00:21:13.538 --> 00:21:14.973 line:95%,end
what can I bring Abby?

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:17.843 line:95%,end
It's just a little something
that Melissa and I...

00:21:17.909 --> 00:21:19.578 line:95%,end
(laughter)

00:21:19.645 --> 00:21:20.946 line:95%,end
JILL: ...we saw it and thought of you.

00:21:21.513 --> 00:21:24.316 line:95%,end
ABBY: Ooh.

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:25.784 line:95%,end
Pretty.

00:21:25.851 --> 00:21:27.919 line:95%,end
Now I need a gold outfit to go with it.

00:21:27.986 --> 00:21:29.955 line:95%,end
And gold earrings and a gold necklace.

00:21:30.022 --> 00:21:31.123 line:95%,end
JILL: You can get that next week.

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:36.495 line:95%,end
Hey, ladies, I'm going to put this away,

00:21:36.561 --> 00:21:38.230 line:95%,end
but thank you very much
for thinking of me.

00:21:38.897 --> 00:21:41.033 line:95%,end
How about the next time you're out,
I need a husband.

00:21:53.412 --> 00:21:55.814 line:95%,end
Never a dull moment

(indistinct chatter)

00:21:58.083 --> 00:21:59.518 line:95%,end
Oh, I got mail.

00:21:59.584 --> 00:22:01.787 line:95%,end
So we arrive at the hotel in Columbus,

00:22:01.853 --> 00:22:03.989 line:95%,end
and as we're checking in,
Kelly gets a note.

00:22:04.056 --> 00:22:05.957 line:95%,end
We are cordially invited to a soiree

00:22:06.024 --> 00:22:08.660 line:95%,end
in the presidential suite
downtown Columbus.

00:22:08.727 --> 00:22:11.063 line:95%,end
Cocktail attire encouraged.

00:22:11.129 --> 00:22:12.264 line:95%,end
What kind of event is this?

00:22:13.231 --> 00:22:14.499 line:95%,end
-(squeals)
-What is it?

00:22:14.566 --> 00:22:15.934 line:95%,end
-Let me see.
-Oh, no.

00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:17.369 line:95%,end
A freaking apple.

00:22:23.875 --> 00:22:24.843 line:95%,end

MELISSA: Hi, you're not wearing a gown.

00:22:32.484 --> 00:22:33.685 line:95%,end
Thank goodness you're not wearing a gown.

00:22:33.752 --> 00:22:34.619 line:95%,end
We thought you'd be wearing a gown.

00:22:34.686 --> 00:22:36.688 line:5%,start
CATHY: You know how you're supposed
to keep your friends close

00:22:36.755 --> 00:22:37.956 line:5%,start
and your enemies closer?

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:41.493 line:95%,end
<i>Well, these ladies need to see</i>

<i>Something Abby Lee doesn't</i>

Have you guys missed me?

00:22:51.069 --> 00:22:53.605 line:95%,end
CATHY: I am actually excited to see Abby,
I hate to say it.

00:22:53.672 --> 00:22:55.340 line:95%,end
Do you think she's a good leader?

00:22:55.407 --> 00:22:58.443 line:95%,end
She just wants our kids
to be the best they can be.

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:02.247 line:95%,end
I just feel you guys would be so happy
if you were someplace

00:23:02.314 --> 00:23:04.049 line:95%,end
where you had a good leader.

00:23:08.353 --> 00:23:09.821 line:95%,end
I don't think there's
anything wrong with that.

00:23:09.888 --> 00:23:12.290 line:95%,end
How many fights have you had
with her already?

00:23:12.357 --> 00:23:13.925 line:95%,end
KELLY: Oh, God, I don't even know.

00:23:14.826 --> 00:23:18.230 line:95%,end
It seems like it's a negative
experience for you guys.

00:23:18.296 --> 00:23:20.132 line:95%,end
Why don't you go somewhere
where you're going to be happy?

00:23:20.198 --> 00:23:21.900 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Never in a million years
did I ever think

00:23:21.967 --> 00:23:23.568 line:95%,end
Cathy would try to poach us from Abby.

00:23:23.635 --> 00:23:24.903 line:95%,end
I thought she hated us.

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:28.373 line:95%,end
Abby is still playing her games.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:29.641 line:95%,end
That's too bad.

(tense music playing)

00:23:37.249 --> 00:23:38.417 line:95%,end
Get them up, get them up.

ABBY: <i>When we got off of the bus,</i>

00:23:40.619 --> 00:23:42.988 line:5%,start
I told my girls and their mothers,

00:23:43.054 --> 00:23:44.823 line:5%,start
game faces on.

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:47.926 line:95%,end
CATHY: Abby Lee, she draws on abs.

00:23:48.527 --> 00:23:49.828 line:95%,end
We have real abs.

00:23:49.895 --> 00:23:50.896 line:95%,end
Keep going.

00:23:51.163 --> 00:23:52.264 line:95%,end
There they are.

00:23:52.731 --> 00:23:54.833 line:95%,end
Keep your heads up high, all right?

00:23:55.434 --> 00:23:57.302 line:95%,end
And remember, no running,
hugging, kissing.

00:23:57.369 --> 00:23:58.570 line:95%,end
Just, "Hi, how are you?"

00:23:58.637 --> 00:23:59.704 line:95%,end
Guys, guys, guys, guys, come here.

00:23:59.771 --> 00:24:00.772 line:95%,end
Don't even look at them.

00:24:00.839 --> 00:24:03.708 line:95%,end
Do not look at them, keep your eyes on me.

00:24:04.109 --> 00:24:05.510 line:95%,end
Hey. How are you?

00:24:05.577 --> 00:24:06.778 line:95%,end
You forgot a curler?

(laughter)

00:24:10.115 --> 00:24:10.949 line:95%,end
Very fashionable.

00:24:11.016 --> 00:24:12.784 line:95%,end
ABBY: Nobody could tell me?

00:24:13.685 --> 00:24:15.220 line:95%,end
-Hi, guys. How are you?
-ABBY: Oh, my God.

00:24:15.287 --> 00:24:16.221 line:95%,end
GIRL: Hi.

00:24:16.288 --> 00:24:17.389 line:95%,end
Come on. Let's go girls.

-All right. Good to see you.
-Thank you.

00:24:19.858 --> 00:24:21.793 line:95%,end

00:24:25.964 --> 00:24:27.866 line:95%,end
<i>I'm going to go with entertainment value.</i>

00:24:27.933 --> 00:24:29.501 line:95%,end
I'm going to pull my bow and arrow,

00:24:29.568 --> 00:24:31.436 line:95%,end
and I am going to be right on target.

00:24:31.503 --> 00:24:34.906 line:95%,end
Ladies, think of everything
I yell at you about five days ago,

00:24:34.973 --> 00:24:37.943 line:95%,end
four days ago, three days ago,
two days ago, yesterday.

00:24:38.009 --> 00:24:39.344 line:95%,end
Go over that dance in your head.

00:24:39.411 --> 00:24:41.279 line:95%,end
This is really important to me personally,

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:43.849 line:95%,end
it's really important to your moms.

00:24:44.182 --> 00:24:45.584 line:95%,end
JILL: <i>Kendall's a competitor,</i>

00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:47.586 line:95%,end
<i>but I'm not sure she fully understands</i>

getting an Abby Lee
League Dance Company jacket

00:24:53.058 --> 00:24:55.494 line:95%,end
or going back to the regular process.

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:56.561 line:95%,end
You understand?

00:24:57.062 --> 00:24:58.597 line:95%,end
Yes, mom? You understand that?

00:24:58.663 --> 00:24:59.531 line:95%,end
-JILL: I do.
-Okay.

00:24:59.598 --> 00:25:01.700 line:95%,end
So to--in order to do that, I expect--

00:25:01.766 --> 00:25:05.303 line:95%,end
I want your corrections
that I've corrected fixed.

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:07.639 line:95%,end
Kendall forgets
that she is still on probation.

00:25:08.373 --> 00:25:11.877 line:95%,end
And unless these technical issues
get cleaned up quickly...

00:25:13.078 --> 00:25:14.012 line:95%,end
her days are numbered.

00:25:14.079 --> 00:25:15.547 line:95%,end
KELLY: Ready for a snood?

00:25:15.614 --> 00:25:16.815 line:95%,end
HOLLY: And what about that?

00:25:18.617 --> 00:25:20.652 line:95%,end
Let me go over this whole hair thing.

00:25:20.719 --> 00:25:22.587 line:95%,end
HOLLY: <i>I think the most stressful part</i>

00:25:22.654 --> 00:25:25.490 line:95%,end
of getting the girls ready
for the competition is the hair.

00:25:25.557 --> 00:25:29.628 line:5%,start
If your snood or your rat
comes undone on stage,

00:25:29.694 --> 00:25:31.263 line:5%,start
that is not going to be good.

00:25:34.566 --> 00:25:35.967 line:95%,end
ABBY: Wait a minute, wait a minute here.

00:25:36.034 --> 00:25:37.869 line:95%,end
-This is a snood.
-I know.

00:25:37.936 --> 00:25:40.705 line:95%,end
We have to--we can't wear
different things on stage, you guys.

00:25:40.772 --> 00:25:42.541 line:95%,end
Why am I finding out this now?

00:25:42.607 --> 00:25:44.209 line:95%,end
You know, these moms
may not know the difference

00:25:44.276 --> 00:25:46.745 line:95%,end
between snoods, but I can tell.

00:25:46.811 --> 00:25:49.381 line:95%,end
Some are thick crocheted knitted scnoods,

00:25:49.447 --> 00:25:52.884 line:95%,end
<i>and the other are really thin nylon</i>
<i>almost like a hairnet.</i>

00:25:52.951 --> 00:25:56.187 line:95%,end
Every one of these snoods
has to be exactly the same.

00:25:56.254 --> 00:25:58.623 line:95%,end
<i>Details could make or break a number.</i>

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:00.625 line:95%,end
But why didn't you buy
seven new ones of that?

00:26:01.192 --> 00:26:03.929 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Because when I left
yesterday morning,

00:26:03.995 --> 00:26:07.265 line:95%,end
I searched around four different stores
Saturday morning.

00:26:07.332 --> 00:26:08.166 line:95%,end
That's what I got.

00:26:08.233 --> 00:26:10.201 line:95%,end
But nobody told me, I would've said,

00:26:10.268 --> 00:26:11.870 line:95%,end
"Hey, Holly,
don't buy something different."

00:26:11.937 --> 00:26:12.904 line:95%,end
Where you? Where were you?

00:26:12.971 --> 00:26:13.905 line:95%,end
Four different stores,

00:26:13.972 --> 00:26:15.674 line:95%,end
four different stores,
four different stores.

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:19.544 line:95%,end
Holly, go to 14 different stores
and then start complaining.

00:26:19.611 --> 00:26:22.514 line:95%,end
I said, buy seven of the same thing.

00:26:22.581 --> 00:26:25.417 line:95%,end
You know what, I'm getting sick and tired
about hearing these snoods, okay?

00:26:25.483 --> 00:26:28.853 line:95%,end
ABBY: I want the thin ones
that Holly bought

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:32.190 line:95%,end
in everybody's hair,
and I want this in Nia's hair.

00:26:32.257 --> 00:26:34.225 line:95%,end
We have to have the same thing.

00:26:34.292 --> 00:26:35.493 line:95%,end
I'm the choreographer.

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:37.128 line:95%,end
Yoo-hoo, I'm over here.

00:26:37.195 --> 00:26:38.630 line:95%,end
<i>I designed the costume.</i>

00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:41.933 line:95%,end
The rats and the snoods make the number.

00:26:44.703 --> 00:26:45.937 line:95%,end
What do you mean last night?

00:26:47.172 --> 00:26:48.006 line:95%,end
MELISSA: We had a soiree--

00:26:48.073 --> 00:26:51.042 line:95%,end
We had a soiree,
and she was the only person there.

00:26:51.109 --> 00:26:52.777 line:95%,end
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

00:26:53.244 --> 00:26:56.381 line:95%,end
When I left last night,
you all didn't go up to your rooms?

00:26:56.448 --> 00:26:58.383 line:95%,end
JILL: No, we went and changed.

00:26:59.517 --> 00:27:01.820 line:95%,end
Well, I think that's
really going behind my back,

00:27:01.886 --> 00:27:02.821 line:95%,end
and I don't appreciate it.

00:27:02.887 --> 00:27:03.955 line:95%,end
But what does she have to say?

00:27:04.022 --> 00:27:05.557 line:95%,end
Because that's solicitation.

00:27:05.824 --> 00:27:08.293 line:95%,end
KELLY: She was asking us
why we stay at your studio.

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:10.595 line:95%,end
She just had some
not so nice things to say about you.

00:27:10.662 --> 00:27:14.132 line:95%,end
I would never go
and invite a bunch of moms

00:27:14.199 --> 00:27:15.634 line:95%,end
from another dance studio to my room

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:17.035 line:95%,end
and then talk about their teacher.

00:27:17.102 --> 00:27:20.805 line:95%,end

You need to.

-Who is?
-The competition.

00:37:04.488 --> 00:37:06.724 line:95%,end
Yeah, because I was back there,
and the girl walked over and goes,

00:37:06.791 --> 00:37:09.193 line:95%,end
we need birth certificates
for Cathy's students.

Hi, Cathy. I'm Leigh with Rising Star.

Hi. Nice to meet you.

00:37:13.064 --> 00:37:14.599 line:5%,start
We've got a lot of people questioning--

00:37:14.665 --> 00:37:15.900 line:95%,end
-Yeah?
-Erica?

00:37:15.967 --> 00:37:17.201 line:95%,end
-Yes.
-Erica's age.

00:37:17.268 --> 00:37:18.703 line:95%,end
-Yeah.
-We have people complaining

00:37:18.769 --> 00:37:20.638 line:95%,end
that they have seen her perform

00:37:21.205 --> 00:37:24.242 line:95%,end
in the 14 age division
at other competitions.

00:37:24.308 --> 00:37:26.344 line:95%,end
CATHY: Okay, so I don't have
birth certificates.

00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:27.645 line:95%,end
I didn't have to have
a birth certificates at the last--

00:37:27.712 --> 00:37:30.348 line:95%,end
Let me ask you a question,
how old is Erica in her date of birth?

00:37:30.414 --> 00:37:32.283 line:95%,end
-Erica is 14.
-GINA: Correct.

00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:34.619 line:95%,end
-January--yeah.
-January 17, 1997.

00:37:34.685 --> 00:37:37.622 line:95%,end
-So '97, she's 13, 14, then?
-GINA: Yeah.

00:37:37.688 --> 00:37:39.257 line:95%,end
All right, she is in
the wrong age division.

00:37:39.323 --> 00:37:40.358 line:95%,end
And so is Brooke.

00:37:40.424 --> 00:37:42.159 line:95%,end
Okay, I'll take that up in a minute with--

00:37:42.226 --> 00:37:44.695 line:95%,end
-We definitely need to take that up, okay?
-LEIGH: Okay. I will.

00:37:44.762 --> 00:37:45.763 line:95%,end
-I promise you, okay.
-Okay.

00:37:46.664 --> 00:37:47.932 line:95%,end
LEIGH: Hi, Abby.

00:37:47.999 --> 00:37:49.867 line:95%,end
-ABBY: Hi, how are you?
-Good.

00:37:49.934 --> 00:37:52.370 line:95%,end
We got somebody questioning Brooke's age.

00:37:52.436 --> 00:37:54.438 line:95%,end
ABBY: Okay, she's 13, and she turned--

00:37:54.505 --> 00:37:55.706 line:95%,end
LEIGH: When is her birth date?

00:37:56.274 --> 00:37:57.341 line:95%,end
January--

00:37:57.408 --> 00:37:58.643 line:95%,end
Of what year?

00:38:02.046 --> 00:38:02.880 line:95%,end
LEIGH: Of '98.

00:38:02.947 --> 00:38:05.149 line:95%,end
Our ages go as of the first of the year,

00:38:05.916 --> 00:38:08.319 line:95%,end
-so she would have been 12...
-Right.

00:38:08.386 --> 00:38:10.354 line:95%,end
...the first year she turned 13
in January.

00:38:10.421 --> 00:38:12.023 line:5%,start
Right.

00:38:12.089 --> 00:38:14.125 line:95%,end
ABBY: I can call and get it faxed.

00:38:14.191 --> 00:38:15.026 line:95%,end
LEIGH: That'll do.

00:38:15.092 --> 00:38:17.061 line:95%,end
KELLY: <i>Some of the people</i>
<i>at the competition</i>

00:38:17.128 --> 00:38:20.197 line:95%,end
thought that Brooke wasn't
in the correct age category.

00:38:21.866 --> 00:38:24.168 line:5%,start
Is one of them Candy Apple, Cathy Nesbitt?

00:38:24.235 --> 00:38:26.437 line:95%,end
-Yes, she is.
-I mean, that girl she had in there...

00:38:26.504 --> 00:38:29.073 line:95%,end
-LEIGH: Uh-huh.
-...there is no way that she's 12.

00:38:29.473 --> 00:38:30.308 line:95%,end
LEIGH: No, she is not.

00:38:30.374 --> 00:38:31.442 line:95%,end
She is 13, 14.

00:38:31.509 --> 00:38:33.077 line:95%,end
-We've already moved her out--
-ABBY: Okay good. 'Cause I was gonna say.

00:38:33.144 --> 00:38:35.179 line:95%,end
I mean, you know how long
I've been doing it.

00:38:35.246 --> 00:38:37.982 line:95%,end
I have never seen a dance instructor

00:38:38.049 --> 00:38:41.319 line:95%,end

<i>Erika is a beautiful dancer.</i>

00:38:43.387 --> 00:38:46.524 line:95%,end
<i>Had her teacher entered her</i>

00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:48.759 line:95%,end
she probably would have
won the whole thing.

00:38:48.826 --> 00:38:51.128 line:95%,end
But, instead, she was disqualified.

00:38:51.195 --> 00:38:52.697 line:95%,end
CATHY: But you know what?
It doesn't matter.

00:38:53.964 --> 00:38:56.267 line:95%,end

She was born in January of 1998,

00:39:06.811 --> 00:39:10.581 line:95%,end

00:39:10.648 --> 00:39:11.882 line:95%,end
They need her birth certificate.

Is there any way you
could take a picture with your phone
