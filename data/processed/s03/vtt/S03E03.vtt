ABBY LEE MILLER:
Previously on "Dance Moms."

00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:05.105 line:5%,start
- Kelly is not going to crawl back.
- No.

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:07.440 line:5%,start
Girls, I'm replacing Brooke and Paige.

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:11.344 line:5%,start
Who would like to be on this team
of the Abby Lee Dance Company?

00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:12.645 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: Should we get
our cat claws ready?

00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:13.546 line:5%,start
[imitating cat]

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.615 line:5%,start
- Who are you?
- I am Ally's mom.

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:16.850 line:5%,start
JILL: Oh.

00:00:16.916 --> 00:00:17.884 line:5%,start
ABBY LEE MILLER: My new angel.

00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:18.985 line:5%,start
She was stunning.

00:00:19.052 --> 00:00:20.253 line:5%,start
We're missing Kelly.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.888 line:5%,start
We all do.
I don't know about Abby.

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:23.990 line:5%,start
She [bleep] all over that title.

00:00:24.057 --> 00:00:25.759 line:5%,start
Coming up on "Dance Moms."

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:27.060 line:5%,start
- I just want Kelly back.
- I know.

00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:28.128 line:5%,start
That's the plan.

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:30.430 line:5%,start
Girls, where are you?

00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:31.698 line:5%,start
I should be in there doing the pyramid.

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:33.433 line:5%,start
I don't know where everybody is.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.402 line:5%,start
There's people standing
in the parking lot.

00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:36.536 line:5%,start
What's going on?

00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:39.639 line:5%,start
You're replaced. That's it. Finished.

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:41.107 line:5%,start
Done. Let's go.

00:00:41.174 --> 00:00:42.142 line:5%,start
Let's get on the phone.

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:44.044 line:5%,start
We have to replace all these kids.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.012 line:5%,start
This competition is huge.

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.382 line:5%,start
If we don't win, then those
mothers had the last laugh.

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:51.284 line:5%,start
This can make you or break you.

00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:52.552 line:5%,start
[music playing]

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.355 line:95%,end
(SINGING) Get up.

00:00:55.688 --> 00:00:57.457 line:95%,end
Get on the floor.

00:00:57.524 --> 00:01:02.929 line:95%,end
My world is with my girls
living on the dance floor.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.266 line:5%,start
[upbeat music]

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:13.773 line:95%,end
Hey.

00:01:14.874 --> 00:01:17.243 line:95%,end
So where is our newest addition?
Did we scare her away?

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.812 line:95%,end
- Holly, nice to meet you.
- Shelly, nice to meet you.

00:01:18.878 --> 00:01:20.213 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Shelly?
- Yes, Shelly.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.881 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Oh, nice to meet you.
- And that's Ally.

00:01:21.948 --> 00:01:23.316 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Oh, OK.

00:01:23.383 --> 00:01:24.617 line:95%,end
Probably in there.

00:01:24.684 --> 00:01:26.252 line:95%,end
She's probably having private--
she's probably already in there.

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:28.288 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Or she's probably
cleaning Abby's bathroom.

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:31.424 line:5%,start
I think the moms are finally
just at their breaking point.

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:33.893 line:95%,end
We're a team and a team includes Kelly.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.162 line:95%,end
And I think Abby's saying, oh, no.

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:37.931 line:95%,end
This team is going to include Shelly.

00:01:37.997 --> 00:01:39.599 line:95%,end
That's not what we signed up for.

00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:42.001 line:95%,end
Kelly obviously left for a reason,

00:01:42.068 --> 00:01:44.204 line:95%,end
and she feels that this
isn't the place for her.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.007 line:95%,end
So I think it's up to us to convince her
that she belongs with us.

00:01:48.074 --> 00:01:51.511 line:5%,start
The team is not the same
without Kelly, Paige, and Brooke.

00:01:51.578 --> 00:01:52.712 line:95%,end
There's a void there.

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:54.481 line:95%,end
We're going to take a stand.

00:01:54.547 --> 00:01:56.549 line:95%,end
We're going to stand up for what is right.

00:01:56.616 --> 00:01:57.917 line:95%,end
I just want Kelly back.

00:01:57.984 --> 00:01:59.119 line:95%,end
I know. That's the plan.

00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:00.453 line:95%,end
So what is the plan?

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.621 line:95%,end
Put a date.

00:02:01.688 --> 00:02:06.159 line:95%,end
Put the weekend that we
know that there was--

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.931 line:95%,end
Wait, they're really all going
to the ladies room together?

00:02:11.998 --> 00:02:13.967 line:5%,start
I'm sitting at the front desk working,

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:16.169 line:5%,start
and the moms walk in
and waltz right by me.

00:02:16.236 --> 00:02:18.505 line:5%,start
They're acting very suspicious.

00:02:25.345 --> 00:02:26.679 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Beautiful.
[laughs]

00:02:26.746 --> 00:02:28.848 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Well, you know, I do what I can.

00:02:31.384 --> 00:02:35.622 line:5%,start
So basically, the moms and I all decided
that we're just going to sit there silent,

00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:37.790 line:95%,end
and we're not going to go into pyramid,

00:02:37.857 --> 00:02:41.661 line:95%,end
and we're just going to have a standoff
trying to get Kelly back.

00:02:46.065 --> 00:02:48.268 line:95%,end
So, ladies, have you recovered
from your weekend?

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:53.106 line:95%,end
I don't know what these moms
are trying to pull on me.

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:55.642 line:95%,end
I'm polite.
I'm trying to have a conversation,

00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:58.878 line:95%,end
and they won't say one word to me.

00:02:58.945 --> 00:03:00.446 line:95%,end
What is going on?

00:03:05.418 --> 00:03:07.086 line:95%,end
Girls.

00:03:07.153 --> 00:03:08.588 line:95%,end
Come on, I want to get going
for the pyramid.

00:03:08.655 --> 00:03:09.822 line:95%,end
Where are you?

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:11.324 line:95%,end
Girls.

00:03:12.325 --> 00:03:13.326 line:95%,end
This is ridiculous.

00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:15.595 line:95%,end
I just saw the moms at the
front desk a few minutes ago.

00:03:15.662 --> 00:03:17.530 line:95%,end
And where are the girls?

00:03:17.597 --> 00:03:20.433 line:95%,end
I don't know what's going on,
but if they're trying to piss me off,

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.935 line:95%,end
mission accomplished.

00:03:22.302 --> 00:03:24.571 line:95%,end
The moms and the girls have disappeared.

00:03:24.637 --> 00:03:26.372 line:95%,end
Poof.
Be gone.

00:03:29.676 --> 00:03:32.745 line:95%,end
Melissa, this is Abby.
I don't know what's going on.

00:03:32.812 --> 00:03:34.480 line:95%,end
If this has something to do with Kelly

00:03:34.547 --> 00:03:40.019 line:95%,end
and replacing her kids for real,
you are losing your mind.

00:03:40.086 --> 00:03:42.889 line:95%,end
If you're going to jeopardize
Maddie and McKenzie

00:03:42.956 --> 00:03:45.892 line:95%,end
over her two kids, you're crazy.

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.627 line:95%,end
You are crazy.

00:03:48.094 --> 00:03:49.662 line:95%,end
The moms are trying to make a point

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:52.632 line:95%,end
about Kelly and her daughters
not being at the studio anymore.

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:53.900 line:95%,end
Fine.

00:03:53.967 --> 00:03:55.501 line:95%,end
The show must go on.

00:03:55.568 --> 00:03:59.005 line:95%,end
There's a competition this weekend
in Fort Wayne, Indiana.

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:00.873 line:95%,end
I'm going to work with
the people that are here.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.343 line:95%,end
I'm going to start on Ally's solo.

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:08.014 line:5%,start
Take that right foot and turn
it out and dig it really hard.

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:09.349 line:5%,start
Cuts.

00:04:10.183 --> 00:04:11.251 line:5%,start
Cuts.

00:04:12.185 --> 00:04:14.821 line:5%,start
Now you're going to take
that leg and almost--

00:04:14.887 --> 00:04:16.856 line:5%,start
The whole team's gone.
They're gone.

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:19.125 line:5%,start
They're, like, gone.
It's not like they're gone for the night.

00:04:19.192 --> 00:04:21.027 line:95%,end
They're gone.
They are all gone.

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:22.528 line:95%,end
So I'm just alone.

00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:24.564 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: So you're
going through the fire,

00:04:24.631 --> 00:04:26.266 line:95%,end
like there's a big--
there's flames here

00:04:26.332 --> 00:04:27.867 line:95%,end
and you're trying to get through it.

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:29.269 line:95%,end
[inaudible] foot.


00:04:31.571 --> 00:04:32.905 line:95%,end
I don't know what happened.

00:04:32.972 --> 00:04:34.641 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: I don't know
what's going on.

00:04:34.707 --> 00:04:37.010 line:95%,end
I don't know what their beef is,
and I don't know what they're doing,

00:04:37.076 --> 00:04:39.145 line:95%,end
but I think that Melissa is a fool.

00:04:39.579 --> 00:04:43.149 line:95%,end
Maddie needs me,
and she needs to dance.

00:04:43.216 --> 00:04:45.551 line:95%,end
The rest of them could probably
go be girl scouts.

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:48.921 line:95%,end
I have to worry about the kids
that want to dance,

00:04:48.988 --> 00:04:50.456 line:95%,end
not the ones that don't.

00:04:50.523 --> 00:04:53.293 line:95%,end
SHELLY: Do you think this is about Kelly?
Do you think that--

00:04:53.359 --> 00:04:55.194 line:95%,end
What do you think?
Did the kids say anything to you?

00:04:55.762 --> 00:04:58.965 line:95%,end
SHELLY: Nobody said anything.
I don't think this is the kids.

00:04:59.032 --> 00:05:01.267 line:95%,end
I mean, they're just kids.
They can't make the decision.

00:05:01.334 --> 00:05:03.936 line:95%,end
Why?
I was 14 when I started my company.

00:05:04.003 --> 00:05:05.104 line:95%,end
That's the age Brooke is.

00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:07.206 line:95%,end
So if she wanted to be here,
call your dad.

00:05:07.273 --> 00:05:08.574 line:95%,end
Have him bring you.

00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:10.176 line:95%,end
Call your neighbor, say,
I need to get to dancing.

00:05:10.243 --> 00:05:11.577 line:95%,end
You don't need to tell him
the whole story.

00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:13.713 line:95%,end
You need to get your head on straight

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.682 line:95%,end
because we have one number
so far and it's your solo

00:05:15.748 --> 00:05:16.783 line:95%,end
and you got to go.

00:05:19.052 --> 00:05:21.187 line:95%,end
Hey, um, where are the moms?

00:05:21.254 --> 00:05:22.255 line:95%,end
They're not here?

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:23.389 line:95%,end
I should be in there doing the pyramid.

00:05:23.456 --> 00:05:24.857 line:95%,end
I don't know where everybody is.

00:05:24.924 --> 00:05:26.326 line:95%,end
The moms are still missing.

00:05:26.392 --> 00:05:27.527 line:95%,end
It's getting late.

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:29.429 line:95%,end
Nobody's heard a word from them.

00:05:29.495 --> 00:05:32.131 line:95%,end
We just wasted an entire
day when we could have been

00:05:32.198 --> 00:05:33.900 line:95%,end
rehearsing for the competition.

00:05:35.034 --> 00:05:36.936 line:95%,end
There's people standing
in the parking lot.

00:05:39.172 --> 00:05:43.142 line:95%,end
Is that-- someone's sitting
on the ground like a dog.

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:44.477 line:95%,end
Melissa.

00:05:45.078 --> 00:05:46.079 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: Really?

00:05:46.145 --> 00:05:47.580 line:95%,end
I am tired of this.

00:05:47.647 --> 00:05:49.982 line:95%,end
The moms are outside
in my parking lot.

00:05:50.049 --> 00:05:51.084 line:95%,end
I've had it.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.019 line:95%,end
I'm going to go out there
and find out what's going on.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.688 line:95%,end
Ladies, what's going on?

00:05:57.156 --> 00:05:58.424 line:95%,end
I'm waiting to do the pyramid.

00:05:58.491 --> 00:06:00.059 line:95%,end
I've been waiting and waiting and waiting.

00:06:01.127 --> 00:06:02.662 line:95%,end
Ladies, what's going on?

00:06:03.596 --> 00:06:04.797 line:95%,end
Holly, something has to be going on

00:06:04.864 --> 00:06:07.133 line:95%,end
or you would never
be so rude to me personally.

00:06:08.101 --> 00:06:11.003 line:95%,end
You guys are having a--
what is it called-- a sit-in.

00:06:12.405 --> 00:06:15.475 line:95%,end
Ladies, are we this upset
over one new student?

00:06:15.541 --> 00:06:17.076 line:95%,end
Are you that jealous?

00:06:17.877 --> 00:06:20.079 line:95%,end
If you're doing this for Kelly,
you're a fool.

00:06:20.146 --> 00:06:21.981 line:95%,end
This is completely unprofessional.

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:23.783 line:95%,end
Do you think that your kids are going

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:25.985 line:95%,end
to go on and work professionally
after this behavior?

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:27.320 line:95%,end
That's ridiculous.

00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:29.222 line:95%,end
Melissa, I tried to tell you.

00:06:29.288 --> 00:06:32.525 line:95%,end
Your kid's working her butt off
doing a solo every week.

00:06:32.592 --> 00:06:36.095 line:95%,end
And the other kids are broken,
lying on the floor whining.

00:06:36.162 --> 00:06:39.031 line:95%,end
When Abby comes out, it's like
the scene from "Jurassic Park."

00:06:39.098 --> 00:06:40.700 line:95%,end
We're all sitting in our cars

00:06:40.767 --> 00:06:42.368 line:95%,end
and, like, here comes
the Tyrannosaurus Rex.

00:06:42.435 --> 00:06:43.436 line:95%,end
Holly's not moving.

00:06:43.503 --> 00:06:45.605 line:95%,end
And I'm thinking, thank god, Holly,
because they can sense movement.

00:06:45.671 --> 00:06:48.908 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: You're replaced.
That's it. Finished. Done.

00:06:48.975 --> 00:06:50.143 line:95%,end
See what happens to people?

00:06:50.209 --> 00:06:51.677 line:95%,end
You do all this crap for their kid,

00:06:51.744 --> 00:06:53.679 line:95%,end
you get them to win
a national championship,

00:06:53.746 --> 00:06:55.014 line:95%,end
and then they [bleep] all over you.

00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:56.516 line:95%,end
They start when they're 3 years old.

00:06:56.582 --> 00:06:58.284 line:95%,end
They don't know their right foot
from their left.

00:06:58.351 --> 00:07:01.053 line:95%,end
Their kid becomes a star.
They're winning titles.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.890 line:95%,end
And the parents suddenly think
they know something more.

00:07:03.956 --> 00:07:05.925 line:95%,end
Let's go.
Let's get on the phone.

00:07:05.992 --> 00:07:07.827 line:95%,end
We have to replace all these kids.

00:07:08.895 --> 00:07:10.730 line:95%,end
We have one great soloist, right?

00:07:10.797 --> 00:07:11.798 line:95%,end
All right.

00:07:12.765 --> 00:07:13.766 line:95%,end
Thank you.

00:07:15.001 --> 00:07:17.203 line:95%,end
PHONE OPERATOR: (ON PHONE) Allegheny
County, 911, what's your emergency?

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.705 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: Hi.
I have a trespassing issue.

00:07:19.772 --> 00:07:20.840 line:95%,end
PHONE OPERATOR: (ON PHONE)
Your name?

00:07:20.907 --> 00:07:22.375 line:95%,end
Abby Miller.

00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:27.547 line:95%,end
There's just four cars of people
in my parking lot that will not move.

00:07:27.613 --> 00:07:29.949 line:95%,end
I just want the police to tell them
they need to move their cars.

00:07:30.016 --> 00:07:31.684 line:95%,end
They need to be off my lot.

00:07:31.751 --> 00:07:32.752 line:95%,end
PHONE OPERATOR: (ON
PHONE) All right.

00:07:32.819 --> 00:07:33.820 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: Bye bye.

00:07:34.454 --> 00:07:38.157 line:95%,end
[sighs] I have tons of kids dying
to be on this competition team.

00:07:38.224 --> 00:07:40.426 line:95%,end
So I want to go back to the
files from the competition

00:07:40.493 --> 00:07:43.262 line:95%,end
and call people that can
get in their cars right now

00:07:43.329 --> 00:07:46.365 line:95%,end
and drive to Pittsburgh
and be here for rehearsal tomorrow.

00:07:47.099 --> 00:07:48.835 line:95%,end
Times, they are a changin'.

00:07:48.901 --> 00:07:51.404 line:95%,end
Yes, hi.
This is Abby Lee Miller.

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:55.641 line:95%,end
Is there a Kaeli there that attended
an open call audition for me?

00:07:55.708 --> 00:07:57.677 line:95%,end
- WOMAN: (ON PHONE) Yeah.
- Yes.

00:07:57.743 --> 00:08:01.280 line:95%,end
I need you to find a way
to get her here tomorrow.

00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:06.886 line:95%,end
I understand that you have
a very talented little girl.

00:08:06.953 --> 00:08:11.257 line:95%,end
I've been hearing from everybody
that she is 10 times better than Maddie.

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:14.026 line:95%,end
How can we get you
on a plane tomorrow?

00:08:14.093 --> 00:08:17.063 line:95%,end
Come to Pittsburgh
to the Abby Lee Dance Company

00:08:17.129 --> 00:08:18.798 line:95%,end
and compete with my team.

00:08:22.735 --> 00:08:23.936 line:5%,start
[police siren]

00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:26.138 line:95%,end
Bella's in.

00:08:26.239 --> 00:08:28.407 line:95%,end
She's there and she'll be there
with her at 1 o'clock tomorrow.

00:08:29.308 --> 00:08:31.110 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: And he's pulling behind us.

00:08:31.177 --> 00:08:32.778 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER:
I don't even know what we're doing,

00:08:32.845 --> 00:08:35.314 line:95%,end
but we're the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:08:35.381 --> 00:08:38.351 line:95%,end
We're national champions,
and we'll come up with something.

00:08:38.417 --> 00:08:39.819 line:95%,end
The show must go on.

00:08:40.219 --> 00:08:41.888 line:95%,end
WOMAN: (ON PHONE) OK,
we'll make it happen.

00:08:41.954 --> 00:08:43.322 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: All right. Thank you.

00:08:43.389 --> 00:08:44.824 line:95%,end
WOMAN: (ON PHONE) You as well.
ABBY LEE MILLER: Thank you. Bye.

00:08:44.891 --> 00:08:46.926 line:95%,end
WOMAN: (ON PHONE)
All right, bye bye.

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:50.229 line:95%,end
We're [inaudible] we got a way
better group than we started with.

00:08:50.296 --> 00:08:51.864 line:95%,end
[laughs]


00:08:59.705 --> 00:09:00.740 line:5%,start
JILL: Hello?

00:09:00.806 --> 00:09:02.041 line:95%,end
Anybody home?

00:09:02.108 --> 00:09:03.142 line:95%,end
Hey.

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:04.477 line:95%,end
Look at what the cat dragged in.

00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:05.545 line:95%,end
Look what the cat dragged in?

00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:07.580 line:95%,end
You're out of your radius to be
shown with your stretch pants on there.

00:09:07.647 --> 00:09:08.648 line:5%,start
I know.

00:09:08.714 --> 00:09:10.917 line:5%,start
I'm in the area running
some errands here and there,

00:09:10.983 --> 00:09:13.553 line:5%,start
and I find myself close to my old studio.

00:09:13.619 --> 00:09:16.188 line:95%,end
So I figure, why not stop by Candy Apples

00:09:16.255 --> 00:09:17.557 line:95%,end
and see what's going on in there.

00:09:17.623 --> 00:09:19.058 line:95%,end
So are you guys missing me?

00:09:19.926 --> 00:09:20.927 line:95%,end
Not so much.

00:09:21.761 --> 00:09:22.929 line:95%,end
What's going on with you?

00:09:22.995 --> 00:09:25.131 line:95%,end
Well, we came back from break.

00:09:25.197 --> 00:09:28.534 line:95%,end
And Kelly and the kids,
her two kids, didn't show up.

00:09:28.601 --> 00:09:30.403 line:95%,end
So Abby threw them out.

00:09:30.469 --> 00:09:32.972 line:95%,end
Took them off the pyramid.
Said they're not welcome back.

00:09:33.039 --> 00:09:35.775 line:95%,end
And as of right now,
the kids have no place to dance.

00:09:35.841 --> 00:09:40.947 line:95%,end
So, Jill, you're here because
you want a place on my team?

00:09:41.013 --> 00:09:42.615 line:95%,end
I was in the area.

00:09:42.682 --> 00:09:43.950 line:95%,end
I'm headed through.

00:09:44.016 --> 00:09:48.087 line:95%,end
I thought I could stop in
and have a grown-up conversation with you.

00:09:48.154 --> 00:09:50.356 line:95%,end
Jill, when have we ever
had a grown-up conversation?

00:09:50.423 --> 00:09:51.424 line:95%,end
You know what?
You're right.

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:52.825 line:95%,end
I should have known better.

00:09:52.892 --> 00:09:55.628 line:95%,end
And if you're looking
for another dance studio in Ohio,

00:09:55.695 --> 00:09:58.497 line:95%,end
that's kind of silly, because you've done
that and you've tried that.

00:09:58.564 --> 00:10:01.133 line:95%,end
And furthermore,
aren't you a studio hopper?

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.234 line:95%,end
No.

00:10:02.301 --> 00:10:03.936 line:95%,end
You should take your tails elsewhere.

00:10:04.003 --> 00:10:05.004 line:95%,end
All right.

00:10:05.071 --> 00:10:06.839 line:95%,end
But that's not why I came to Ohio
and you know it.

00:10:06.906 --> 00:10:08.841 line:95%,end
Now I know why I left this place.

00:10:08.908 --> 00:10:10.443 line:95%,end
Nothing has changed.

00:10:10.509 --> 00:10:11.711 line:95%,end
Same old Kathy.

00:10:11.777 --> 00:10:14.580 line:95%,end
She always has some
insult to hurl at you.

00:10:14.647 --> 00:10:17.350 line:5%,start
That's an awfully little Louis Vuitton
you got there.

00:10:17.416 --> 00:10:19.385 line:5%,start
Bye, Jill, thanks for coming.

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:20.186 line:95%,end
I'll see you later.

00:10:20.252 --> 00:10:20.920 line:95%,end
JILL: Whatever.

00:10:20.987 --> 00:10:21.754 line:95%,end
It's always a pleasure.

00:10:29.195 --> 00:10:30.196 line:5%,start
ABBY LEE MILLER: Hello, sweetie.

00:10:30.262 --> 00:10:31.263 line:95%,end
Hey.

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:32.665 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: We do not
have time to waste today--

00:10:32.732 --> 00:10:33.733 line:95%,end
How are y'all doing today?

00:10:33.799 --> 00:10:35.201 line:95%,end
--because as soon as
those other kids get here,

00:10:35.267 --> 00:10:36.535 line:95%,end
we're starting the group.

00:10:36.602 --> 00:10:38.237 line:95%,end
So you need to get in
there, work on your solo,

00:10:38.304 --> 00:10:39.839 line:95%,end
and make sure that
you want to win this.

00:10:40.406 --> 00:10:44.010 line:95%,end
After yesterdays headaches with the moms,
I made a decision.

00:10:44.076 --> 00:10:46.245 line:95%,end
I'm going to replace the entire team.

00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:50.750 line:5%,start
I have a whole new team and they're
on their way to rehearsal right now.

00:10:52.585 --> 00:10:54.186 line:95%,end
Hey, girls. How you doing?

00:10:54.253 --> 00:10:55.254 line:95%,end
Hi.

00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:56.789 line:95%,end
Thank you, moms, for coming.
MARCIA: Thanks for having us.

00:10:56.856 --> 00:10:58.724 line:95%,end
Yeah!
- This is exciting.

00:10:58.791 --> 00:10:59.925 line:95%,end
We're excited to be here.

00:10:59.992 --> 00:11:03.029 line:95%,end
These kids are the new
Abby Lee Dance Company competition team,

00:11:03.095 --> 00:11:05.698 line:95%,end
and they better work.

00:11:05.765 --> 00:11:08.467 line:95%,end
They better work hard,
they better love what they're doing,

00:11:08.534 --> 00:11:10.970 line:95%,end
and they better be appreciative
for the opportunity.

00:11:11.037 --> 00:11:12.038 line:95%,end
This is Bella?

00:11:12.104 --> 00:11:14.440 line:5%,start
You are 10 years old?
You are tall.

00:11:14.507 --> 00:11:15.508 line:5%,start
MARCIA: She is tall.

00:11:15.574 --> 00:11:17.543 line:95%,end
And Kaeli.

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:18.778 line:95%,end
And we have Ally.

00:11:18.844 --> 00:11:20.880 line:95%,end
We have one little girl that's flying in.

00:11:20.946 --> 00:11:24.083 line:95%,end
I really appreciate you giving
everything up and putting

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:26.419 line:95%,end
your life on hold just
to get here quickly.

00:11:26.485 --> 00:11:27.486 line:95%,end
GLORIA: Sure.

00:11:27.553 --> 00:11:31.290 line:95%,end
Their moms better learn
from everyone else's mistakes.

00:11:32.158 --> 00:11:33.726 line:95%,end
MARCIA: This is a huge deal, right?

00:11:33.793 --> 00:11:35.294 line:95%,end
You're going to be part of the group.

00:11:35.361 --> 00:11:37.196 line:95%,end
So you have to go in there,
show them what you got.

00:11:37.263 --> 00:11:38.431 line:95%,end
Good job [inaudible].

00:11:38.497 --> 00:11:40.299 line:95%,end
I'm proud of you both, OK?

00:11:40.366 --> 00:11:42.635 line:95%,end
You have to go in there
and earn your spot on this team.

00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:43.769 line:95%,end
Give daddy proud, OK?

00:11:43.836 --> 00:11:46.605 line:5%,start
I want any opportunity for Bella.

00:11:46.672 --> 00:11:48.974 line:95%,end
And anything that comes Bella's way,

00:11:49.041 --> 00:11:52.411 line:95%,end
we will do everything we can to
help make that happen for her.

00:11:52.478 --> 00:11:53.612 line:95%,end
This is Shelly.

00:11:54.213 --> 00:11:55.214 line:95%,end
Hi, Shelly.

00:11:55.281 --> 00:11:56.615 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: She is from Louisiana.

00:11:56.682 --> 00:11:57.516 line:95%,end
- Shelly.
- Oh, wow.

00:11:57.583 --> 00:11:58.751 line:95%,end
Marcia.
Nice to meet you.

00:11:58.818 --> 00:12:00.119 line:95%,end
GLORIA: Gloria.
- Nice to meet you.

00:12:00.186 --> 00:12:01.087 line:95%,end
GLORIA: Nice to meet you too.

00:12:01.153 --> 00:12:02.722 line:95%,end
I think you're in Kelly's seat.

00:12:02.788 --> 00:12:03.989 line:95%,end
- Oh, no.
- Uh oh.

00:12:04.056 --> 00:12:05.057 line:95%,end
You're in trouble now.

00:12:05.124 --> 00:12:06.992 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: I don't know.
I try not to ever look up here.

00:12:07.059 --> 00:12:08.427 line:95%,end
Where is everybody?

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:13.399 line:95%,end
You have to trust me.
I know what I'm doing.

00:12:13.466 --> 00:12:14.867 line:95%,end
Everyone's replaceable.

00:12:14.934 --> 00:12:15.935 line:95%,end
All right?

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:17.570 line:95%,end
Here we go.

00:12:18.204 --> 00:12:21.240 line:5%,start
People have to make decisions
based on what works best for them.

00:12:21.307 --> 00:12:24.710 line:5%,start
And if that was the decision
that the dance moms

00:12:24.777 --> 00:12:26.178 line:5%,start
had to make, then that's on them.

00:12:26.245 --> 00:12:28.147 line:95%,end
It's giving Kaeli and other girls

00:12:28.214 --> 00:12:31.083 line:95%,end
an opportunity that they wouldn't have
and that's fantastic.

00:12:32.618 --> 00:12:35.488 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: I personally think
that this is so much nicer

00:12:35.554 --> 00:12:37.123 line:95%,end
than sitting up in dance jail.

00:12:37.189 --> 00:12:38.724 line:95%,end
I think she was just looking
for an excuse.

00:12:38.791 --> 00:12:40.092 line:95%,end
Right. Oh, yeah.
Absolutely.

00:12:40.159 --> 00:12:41.861 line:95%,end
- Because she's been dying to replace us.
- I think that's all it was.

00:12:41.927 --> 00:12:44.497 line:95%,end
But she said,
I've been doing this for 32 years.

00:12:44.563 --> 00:12:47.399 line:95%,end
Nobody knew your name until
our kids danced under it.

00:12:47.466 --> 00:12:49.101 line:95%,end
This weekend, they're going to go away,

00:12:49.168 --> 00:12:51.203 line:95%,end
and people are going to be
at wherever they're going--

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:52.571 line:95%,end
And they're going to be
expecting to see our kids.

00:12:52.638 --> 00:12:53.806 line:95%,end
They're going to be
expecting to see our kids.

00:12:53.873 --> 00:12:54.874 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Absolutely.

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:57.276 line:95%,end
Because people go to these
things to see our kids dance.

00:12:57.343 --> 00:12:58.911 line:95%,end
What if we put together
a dance or something

00:12:58.978 --> 00:13:01.781 line:95%,end
and we found a place where
the girls can perform?

00:13:01.847 --> 00:13:03.415 line:95%,end
We'll just put it up on social media.

00:13:03.482 --> 00:13:04.884 line:95%,end
Oh, that would be nice.

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:07.720 line:5%,start
This performance will send
such a huge statement to Abby.

00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:10.389 line:5%,start
Look at all the talent that she
just let walk out of her door.

00:13:10.456 --> 00:13:12.858 line:95%,end
And I really think that
this performance needs to be

00:13:12.925 --> 00:13:14.527 line:95%,end
the performance of a lifetime.

00:13:14.593 --> 00:13:16.295 line:95%,end
We choreograph something on our own.

00:13:16.362 --> 00:13:17.763 line:95%,end
Yeah, we can't use any
of Abby's choreographing.

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:18.931 line:95%,end
HOLLY: And then costumes.

00:13:18.998 --> 00:13:20.733 line:95%,end
I can tell you who
can do the choreography.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:21.901 line:95%,end
Who?


00:13:21.967 --> 00:13:23.135 line:95%,end
The girls.

00:13:23.502 --> 00:13:25.171 line:95%,end
I'm thinking this might be good.

00:13:25.237 --> 00:13:26.305 line:95%,end
I think it'll be fun.

00:13:26.372 --> 00:13:28.007 line:95%,end
I think there's still 
a lot to be gained from it.

00:13:28.073 --> 00:13:30.609 line:95%,end
Oh, I'm so excited. Oh!

00:13:32.378 --> 00:13:33.345 line:95%,end
Hello?

00:13:33.445 --> 00:13:34.880 line:95%,end
YVETTE: (ON PHONE)
Abby, this is Yvette.

00:13:34.947 --> 00:13:35.981 line:95%,end
How are you?

00:13:36.048 --> 00:13:37.449 line:95%,end
Good. How are you?

00:13:37.516 --> 00:13:39.919 line:95%,end
YVETTE: (ON PHONE):
I'm fantastic. Thank you.

00:13:39.985 --> 00:13:43.022 line:95%,end
I hear you're going to be competing
in Indiana this weekend.

00:13:43.088 --> 00:13:45.391 line:95%,end
I am.
I would love to see you.

00:13:45.457 --> 00:13:46.458 line:95%,end
Are you going to be around?

00:13:46.525 --> 00:13:47.927 line:95%,end
Yes, we're going to be there.

00:13:47.993 --> 00:13:49.461 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER:
(ON PHONE) Oh, god.

00:13:49.528 --> 00:13:50.529 line:95%,end
It should be exciting.

00:13:50.596 --> 00:13:52.531 line:95%,end
Is--
YVETTE: (ON PHONE) Hadley

00:13:52.598 --> 00:13:53.766 line:95%,end
Is she competing?

00:13:53.833 --> 00:13:55.734 line:95%,end
She's actually
competing in a solo,

00:13:57.002 --> 00:13:59.038 line:95%,end
and we're bringing a
group number as well.

00:13:59.104 --> 00:14:00.439 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: (ON
PHONE) All right, super.

00:14:00.506 --> 00:14:01.874 line:95%,end
Well then we're going
to see you there?

00:14:01.941 --> 00:14:02.708 line:95%,end
You're going to see me.

00:14:02.775 --> 00:14:03.509 line:95%,end
Absolutely.

00:14:03.576 --> 00:14:04.777 line:95%,end
OK, super.

00:14:05.277 --> 00:14:06.478 line:95%,end
My name is Yvette.

00:14:06.545 --> 00:14:09.682 line:5%,start
My daughter and I were on
"Abby's Ultimate Dance Competition."

00:14:09.748 --> 00:14:14.620 line:5%,start
It was an amazing experience,
but along with that

00:14:14.687 --> 00:14:16.355 line:95%,end
came many ups and downs.

00:14:16.422 --> 00:14:18.190 line:95%,end
Hadley, are you excited for the season?

00:14:18.257 --> 00:14:19.592 line:95%,end
I guess. Kind of.

00:14:19.658 --> 00:14:23.629 line:5%,start
I've been really worried about you since
"Abby's Ultimate Dance Competition."

00:14:23.696 --> 00:14:26.498 line:5%,start
I've been worried about the
things that Abby said to you.

00:14:26.565 --> 00:14:29.468 line:95%,end
Made you question if you
want to continue to dance or not.

00:14:29.535 --> 00:14:33.405 line:95%,end
I feel when Abby found out
that I was a dance teacher myself,

00:14:33.472 --> 00:14:35.074 line:95%,end
I think things turned.

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:39.278 line:95%,end
I think Abby tried to get to me
through Hadley.

00:14:39.345 --> 00:14:41.347 line:95%,end
She tried to break you.

00:14:41.413 --> 00:14:42.915 line:95%,end
Shame on her.

00:14:42.982 --> 00:14:46.252 line:95%,end
It's just different
going to dance every day,

00:14:46.318 --> 00:14:48.087 line:95%,end
because I still have
those words in my head.

00:14:48.153 --> 00:14:50.189 line:95%,end
Which words keep
popping into your head

00:14:50.256 --> 00:14:51.657 line:95%,end
when you go in the dance room?

00:14:52.224 --> 00:14:54.093 line:95%,end
PA: Abby, I'm reading
your facial expression

00:14:54.159 --> 00:14:55.728 line:95%,end
and you don't seem that happy.

00:14:56.729 --> 00:14:58.130 line:95%,end
Should I say roadkill?

00:15:00.065 --> 00:15:01.867 line:95%,end
You're not roadkill.

00:15:01.934 --> 00:15:06.138 line:95%,end
Just hearing her say that,
I've never had someone

00:15:06.205 --> 00:15:10.876 line:95%,end
say that to me before,
like, call me that.

00:15:10.943 --> 00:15:14.113 line:95%,end
Don't let "roadkill"
come back into play at all.

00:15:14.179 --> 00:15:16.849 line:95%,end
I say all the time,
you get what you give.

00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:20.152 line:95%,end
Abby Lee Miller will get it back someday.

00:15:20.853 --> 00:15:22.755 line:95%,end
All right, so can I see it one time?

00:15:22.821 --> 00:15:24.223 line:95%,end
Because she's going to be
coming in here, and I want

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:25.357 line:95%,end
you guys to be perfect.

00:15:25.424 --> 00:15:28.460 line:95%,end
You know, Sophia is,
like, better than Maddie.

00:15:28.527 --> 00:15:29.528 line:95%,end
Like, she's amazing.

00:15:29.595 --> 00:15:31.330 line:95%,end
So you want to be equally as amazing.

00:15:31.397 --> 00:15:34.400 line:95%,end
Sophia is the last member
of our team to arrive.

00:15:34.466 --> 00:15:36.235 line:95%,end
She's a child prodigy.

00:15:36.302 --> 00:15:37.569 line:95%,end
She's all over the internet.

00:15:37.636 --> 00:15:39.538 line:95%,end
She's made appearances on TV.

00:15:39.605 --> 00:15:42.708 line:95%,end
And she's a major deal
at dance competitions.

00:15:42.775 --> 00:15:45.577 line:95%,end
And she is on her way here.

00:15:45.644 --> 00:15:47.346 line:95%,end
Hello, Sophia.

00:15:47.413 --> 00:15:48.580 line:95%,end
Goodbye, Maddie.

00:15:48.647 --> 00:15:49.715 line:95%,end
She doesn't know the dance.

00:15:49.782 --> 00:15:50.916 line:95%,end
She doesn't know anything.

00:15:50.983 --> 00:15:53.152 line:95%,end
She's going to waltz
in here and be the star

00:15:53.218 --> 00:15:54.787 line:95%,end
and take over if you let her.

00:15:54.853 --> 00:15:57.122 line:95%,end
Why would you say that to these guys?
That's nice.

00:15:57.189 --> 00:15:58.190 line:95%,end
Let's go.

00:15:58.257 --> 00:16:00.225 line:95%,end
You don't know how to make
that kind of announcement

00:16:00.292 --> 00:16:02.494 line:95%,end
to a bunch of kids who have been here
working all day.

00:16:02.561 --> 00:16:04.797 line:95%,end
- JACKIE: Hello!
- Hello.

00:16:04.863 --> 00:16:06.432 line:5%,start
- Hi, Miss Abby.
- Good. How are you?

00:16:06.498 --> 00:16:07.866 line:5%,start
- Good. How are you?
- Good.

00:16:07.933 --> 00:16:11.537 line:5%,start
It's good to see you.
Well, welcome, star.

00:16:11.603 --> 00:16:13.005 line:5%,start
Yes?

00:16:13.072 --> 00:16:14.073 line:5%,start
My new Maddie.

00:16:14.139 --> 00:16:15.140 line:95%,end
I'm thrilled.

00:16:15.941 --> 00:16:17.643 line:95%,end
Come on. Let's go.

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:20.913 line:95%,end
Sophia is 10 years old
and dances like a seasoned pro.

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.881 line:95%,end
She's an itty bitty little thing.

00:16:22.948 --> 00:16:26.085 line:95%,end
She is definitely my Maddie replacement.

00:16:27.286 --> 00:16:28.387 line:95%,end
This is Sophia.

00:16:28.454 --> 00:16:31.623 line:95%,end
This is Ally, and Kaeli, and Bella.

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:32.558 line:95%,end
Hi!

00:16:32.624 --> 00:16:33.792 line:95%,end
- Hi!
- Hi.

00:16:33.859 --> 00:16:35.461 line:95%,end
JACKIE: How are you?
- Hi.

00:16:35.527 --> 00:16:37.129 line:95%,end
I'm Jackie.
MARCIA: Hi, Jackie.

00:16:37.196 --> 00:16:38.197 line:95%,end
Hi, I'm Gloria.
JACKIE: Nice to meet you.

00:16:38.263 --> 00:16:40.466 line:95%,end
- It's nice to meet you.
- We just got here.

00:16:40.532 --> 00:16:41.533 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: And one.

00:16:44.136 --> 00:16:45.137 line:95%,end
Nice.

00:16:45.204 --> 00:16:46.872 line:95%,end
She announced the star was almost here.

00:16:46.939 --> 00:16:48.107 line:95%,end
The star was coming.

00:16:48.207 --> 00:16:49.942 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER:
Pretty, pretty, pretty.

00:16:50.009 --> 00:16:50.943 line:95%,end
Bold change.

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:52.177 line:95%,end
Spin.

00:16:52.945 --> 00:16:54.413 line:95%,end
And go, girls.

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.614 line:95%,end
Where is everybody else?

00:16:55.681 --> 00:16:56.815 line:95%,end
Like, where are all the other--

00:16:56.882 --> 00:16:58.083 line:95%,end
- No clue.
- Do we know?

00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:59.218 line:95%,end
That's the
question of the hour.

00:16:59.284 --> 00:17:00.652 line:95%,end
- Do you know?
- No.

00:17:00.719 --> 00:17:03.822 line:95%,end
Do you mind going over the
walking thing one more time?

00:17:03.889 --> 00:17:04.890 line:95%,end
[laughs]

00:17:04.957 --> 00:17:06.025 line:95%,end
She's so cute.

00:17:06.091 --> 00:17:07.059 line:95%,end
Say that again.

00:17:07.126 --> 00:17:10.896 line:95%,end
Do you mind walking through
where I walked through

00:17:10.963 --> 00:17:14.466 line:95%,end
before the lift again,
if that makes sense?

00:17:14.533 --> 00:17:15.901 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: Oh,
you make perfect sense.

00:17:15.968 --> 00:17:17.503 line:95%,end
It's just that voice is killing me.

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:19.338 line:95%,end
You know, Minnie Mouse has a job.

00:17:19.405 --> 00:17:20.539 line:95%,end
We don't need another one.

00:17:20.606 --> 00:17:21.607 line:95%,end
Let's go.

00:17:21.673 --> 00:17:24.109 line:95%,end
As long as Sophia is dancing, I love her.

00:17:24.176 --> 00:17:27.613 line:95%,end
But as soon as she starts talking, woo!

00:17:27.679 --> 00:17:29.248 line:95%,end
I have to lower that voice.

00:17:29.314 --> 00:17:30.349 line:95%,end
Dig down into your diaphragm.

00:17:30.416 --> 00:17:31.950 line:95%,end
Do you take voice lessons?

00:17:32.017 --> 00:17:33.085 line:95%,end
No.

00:17:34.186 --> 00:17:35.387 line:95%,end
- You don't?
- No.

00:17:35.454 --> 00:17:36.889 line:95%,end
Oh, maybe while you're here, you can.

00:17:36.955 --> 00:17:39.758 line:95%,end
You need to dig down deep
in there and find a voice.

00:17:40.192 --> 00:17:41.293 line:95%,end
All right.


00:17:53.205 --> 00:17:54.239 line:5%,start
MOMS: Hi, Sophia.

00:17:54.306 --> 00:17:55.307 line:5%,start
Hey.

00:17:55.507 --> 00:17:57.342 line:95%,end
Did you guys bring your solo costume?

00:17:57.409 --> 00:17:58.544 line:95%,end
You guys bring your costumes?
- No.

00:17:58.610 --> 00:17:59.778 line:95%,end
We have no solos.

00:17:59.845 --> 00:18:01.346 line:95%,end
MARCIA: We don't have solos,
so we don't have costumes.

00:18:01.413 --> 00:18:02.781 line:95%,end
HOLLY: So we don't need costumes.

00:18:02.848 --> 00:18:04.149 line:95%,end
Well, I brought mine.

00:18:06.518 --> 00:18:08.053 line:95%,end
Hello. Good morning.

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.221 line:95%,end
Good morning.

00:18:09.288 --> 00:18:12.391 line:5%,start
All I know is that I want to win.

00:18:12.458 --> 00:18:16.228 line:5%,start
I want to protect the name
of the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:18:16.295 --> 00:18:17.329 line:95%,end
So what do I do?

00:18:17.396 --> 00:18:19.698 line:95%,end
I give Sophia a solo.

00:18:19.765 --> 00:18:21.700 line:95%,end
She is my ace in the hole.

00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:23.235 line:95%,end
You're going to finish your solo.

00:18:23.302 --> 00:18:25.137 line:95%,end
You guys are going to rehearse the group.

00:18:25.204 --> 00:18:28.507 line:95%,end
We are traveling to Fort Wayne, Indiana.

00:18:28.574 --> 00:18:30.776 line:95%,end
It's called Dance Expressions.

00:18:30.843 --> 00:18:33.479 line:95%,end
We are doing the competition tomorrow.

00:18:33.545 --> 00:18:37.349 line:95%,end
You are going to keep my reputation.

00:18:37.416 --> 00:18:39.118 line:95%,end
This is an important weekend for me.

00:18:39.184 --> 00:18:42.254 line:95%,end
I'm debuting the new ALDC team.

00:18:42.321 --> 00:18:44.623 line:95%,end
Everyone's going to see
that the faces have changed,

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:48.527 line:95%,end
but the Abby Lee Dance Company
name is as strong as ever.

00:18:48.594 --> 00:18:50.129 line:95%,end
Now remember, this is it, kiddo.

00:18:50.195 --> 00:18:51.597 line:95%,end
You don't even have a dance finish yet,

00:18:51.663 --> 00:18:52.931 line:95%,end
and you're doing it tomorrow.

00:18:52.998 --> 00:18:53.765 line:95%,end
Let's do it.

00:18:53.832 --> 00:18:54.833 line:5%,start
Go, kid.

00:18:55.801 --> 00:18:56.835 line:5%,start
Sassy.

00:18:57.302 --> 00:18:58.670 line:95%,end
So what's Sophia's solo about?

00:18:58.737 --> 00:19:00.606 line:95%,end
It's called My New Reality.

00:19:00.672 --> 00:19:03.242 line:95%,end
And it's about Abby's new reality.

00:19:03.308 --> 00:19:04.710 line:95%,end
- Really?
- Because she's got new dancers and--

00:19:04.776 --> 00:19:05.777 line:95%,end
I don't know.

00:19:05.844 --> 00:19:08.380 line:95%,end
She keeps calling her--
you're replacing Maddie.

00:19:08.447 --> 00:19:10.749 line:95%,end
That's the new reality, I guess.

00:19:11.383 --> 00:19:12.551 line:95%,end
GLORIA: The new star.

00:19:12.618 --> 00:19:14.086 line:95%,end
MARCIA: I don't even know
why I'm here at this point.

00:19:14.153 --> 00:19:16.588 line:95%,end
This is ridiculous.
Like, why did I bring my kid?

00:19:16.655 --> 00:19:18.157 line:95%,end
Doesn't bother me at all.

00:19:18.223 --> 00:19:21.260 line:95%,end
My Maddie doesn't have to dance
against them anyway.

00:19:21.326 --> 00:19:23.762 line:95%,end
I hope Sophia does well.
She'll be great.

00:19:24.229 --> 00:19:25.531 line:95%,end
She'll be fine.

00:19:25.597 --> 00:19:27.099 line:95%,end
Pretty.
It's use both hand.

00:19:27.166 --> 00:19:28.300 line:95%,end
[inaudible]

00:19:29.368 --> 00:19:30.369 line:5%,start
(SINGING) I was
holding tightly--

00:19:30.435 --> 00:19:32.237 line:5%,start
The group dance is called Cry.

00:19:32.304 --> 00:19:36.909 line:95%,end
It's a lyrical routine and it's beautiful,
and elegant, and feminine.

00:19:36.975 --> 00:19:40.479 line:95%,end
(SINGING) A secret locked down inside.

00:19:40.546 --> 00:19:42.881 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: It's also about
saying goodbye.

00:19:43.482 --> 00:19:45.384 line:95%,end
Saying goodbye to the old things,

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:47.753 line:95%,end
and welcoming in new experiences.

00:19:47.819 --> 00:19:51.657 line:95%,end
And that's exactly what
the Abby Lee Dance Company is doing.

00:19:51.723 --> 00:19:53.926 line:95%,end
We are moving on.

00:19:58.096 --> 00:20:00.499 line:5%,start
KELLY: I'm having all the girls
and the moms at my house today.

00:20:00.566 --> 00:20:03.168 line:95%,end
And I'm really excited
to have everybody together

00:20:03.235 --> 00:20:05.504 line:95%,end
just because we haven't
been together in so long.

00:20:05.571 --> 00:20:07.539 line:95%,end
I think it's going to be fun,
but we have a lot of stuff

00:20:07.606 --> 00:20:08.907 line:95%,end
that we need to talk about.

00:20:08.974 --> 00:20:10.642 line:95%,end
Well, first we have to tell
the girls why we're here.

00:20:10.709 --> 00:20:12.511 line:95%,end
They don't know yet why they're here.

00:20:12.578 --> 00:20:13.745 line:95%,end
So we thought it would
be fun for you guys

00:20:13.812 --> 00:20:16.882 line:95%,end
to do a performance somewhere.

00:20:16.949 --> 00:20:18.584 line:95%,end
- GIRL: We get to make it up?
- Yes.

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:21.186 line:95%,end
- No, we get to make it up.
- No!

00:20:21.253 --> 00:20:22.487 line:95%,end
[laughter]

00:20:22.554 --> 00:20:25.023 line:95%,end
This is a big deal for the girls
and for the moms.

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:28.393 line:95%,end
We need to show everyone
that we don't need Abby.

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:30.229 line:95%,end
She needs us.

00:20:30.295 --> 00:20:31.797 line:95%,end
I think one of the biggest messages

00:20:31.863 --> 00:20:35.000 line:95%,end
that we need to prove
as a group is that Abby

00:20:35.067 --> 00:20:37.135 line:95%,end
needs you guys more than you need her.

00:20:37.202 --> 00:20:40.505 line:95%,end
So we figured that we would find a place
that you guys could go and perform.

00:20:40.572 --> 00:20:43.308 line:95%,end
There would be no judges.
There would be no pressure.

00:20:43.375 --> 00:20:44.710 line:95%,end
Oh, that sounds so fun.

00:20:44.776 --> 00:20:46.578 line:95%,end
So where is this going to take place?

00:20:46.645 --> 00:20:49.715 line:95%,end
I have a call in to a place,
a mall nearby.

00:20:49.781 --> 00:20:50.816 line:95%,end
I just need confirmation.

00:20:50.882 --> 00:20:53.552 line:95%,end
So it's going to be,
I think, at a local mall.

00:20:53.619 --> 00:20:55.120 line:95%,end
Oh, that's kind of fun.

00:20:55.187 --> 00:20:56.755 line:95%,end
And we can shop.
Oh!

00:20:56.822 --> 00:21:00.092 line:95%,end
I could care less what Abby's doing
with this new imposter dance team.

00:21:00.158 --> 00:21:01.193 line:95%,end
It really doesn't matter to me.

00:21:01.893 --> 00:21:03.729 line:95%,end
I just got a text message from Shelly.

00:21:03.795 --> 00:21:07.132 line:95%,end
It says, hey, just letting you
know that Sophia just got here.

00:21:07.199 --> 00:21:11.470 line:95%,end
She just keeps telling me, like,
they're replacing our kids with kids.

00:21:12.404 --> 00:21:13.839 line:95%,end
HOLLY: [inaudible] Abby is,
good luck with that.

00:21:13.905 --> 00:21:14.906 line:95%,end
Oh, lovely.

00:21:14.973 --> 00:21:15.974 line:95%,end
Let's go see what the girls are up to.

00:21:16.041 --> 00:21:18.143 line:95%,end
- I want to go see--
- I want to see what they're doing.

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:20.112 line:95%,end
We can't worry about
Abby's replacement team.

00:21:20.178 --> 00:21:21.179 line:95%,end
You know what?

00:21:21.246 --> 00:21:23.148 line:95%,end
She replaced the whole team,
but you can't be the original

00:21:23.215 --> 00:21:24.983 line:95%,end
because they're not replaceable.

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:27.486 line:95%,end
We need to worry about focusing
on the dance

00:21:27.552 --> 00:21:31.023 line:95%,end
and making it perfection
because we have a big Abby-free debut

00:21:31.089 --> 00:21:32.791 line:95%,end
coming up and it has to be amazing.

00:21:33.992 --> 00:21:35.360 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: All right, moms,
this is it.

00:21:35.427 --> 00:21:36.561 line:95%,end
We're crunch time here.

00:21:36.628 --> 00:21:39.765 line:95%,end
I was just informed
that one of the kids I judged

00:21:39.831 --> 00:21:43.235 line:95%,end
over the break is coming
to the competition.

00:21:43.302 --> 00:21:44.569 line:95%,end
And the mother called me.

00:21:44.636 --> 00:21:46.672 line:95%,end
Her name is Yvette.

00:21:46.738 --> 00:21:48.540 line:95%,end
Her daughter's name is Hadley.

00:21:48.607 --> 00:21:50.242 line:95%,end
- Oh, OK.
- I'm warning you.

00:21:50.309 --> 00:21:53.578 line:95%,end
She does not like me because I told her
that her daughter looked like roadkill.

00:21:53.645 --> 00:21:54.813 line:95%,end
Oh, my god.

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.948 line:95%,end
And they have a group against our group.

00:21:57.015 --> 00:22:00.118 line:95%,end
Hadley is doing a solo in 9 to 11.

00:22:00.185 --> 00:22:02.988 line:95%,end
So I called your daughter roadkill.
Get over it, lady.

00:22:03.055 --> 00:22:04.056 line:95%,end
Let it go.

00:22:04.122 --> 00:22:05.991 line:95%,end
This competition is huge.

00:22:06.058 --> 00:22:08.460 line:95%,end
We're going to walk into that theater,

00:22:08.527 --> 00:22:14.099 line:95%,end
and people are going to expect
to see Brooke, and Chloe, Nia,

00:22:14.166 --> 00:22:15.367 line:95%,end
Maddie.

00:22:15.434 --> 00:22:20.205 line:95%,end
And they're going to see
Ali, Bella, Kaeli, Sophia.

00:22:20.272 --> 00:22:22.574 line:95%,end
This can make you or break you.

00:22:22.641 --> 00:22:24.843 line:95%,end
You step out on that stage and you guys

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:28.714 line:95%,end
win the overall high score, suddenly,

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:30.515 line:95%,end
they could be household names.

00:22:30.582 --> 00:22:32.651 line:95%,end
Do you understand what I'm saying?

00:22:32.718 --> 00:22:36.121 line:95%,end
I've got huge expectations
for the competition this weekend.

00:22:36.188 --> 00:22:38.557 line:95%,end
And if these new girls don't meet them,

00:22:38.623 --> 00:22:40.692 line:95%,end
I'll make a few more phone calls.


00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:46.565 line:5%,start
HOLLY: You got to stay together.

00:22:46.631 --> 00:22:48.800 line:95%,end
Come on. Hurry up. Hurry up.
Stay together.

00:22:48.867 --> 00:22:50.168 line:95%,end
HOLLY: I'd like to know where
the people are.

00:22:50.235 --> 00:22:51.703 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: There is no one here.

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:53.438 line:95%,end
Well, I hope we didn't
do all this for nothing.

00:22:53.505 --> 00:22:56.208 line:95%,end
I'm hoping not,
because then Abby would really--

00:22:56.274 --> 00:22:57.676 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Oh, she would be like--
HOLLY: --get a satisfaction.

00:22:57.743 --> 00:22:58.744 line:95%,end
CHRISTI:
[mimicking Abby complaining]

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:00.078 line:95%,end
See, you really do need me.

00:23:00.145 --> 00:23:01.346 line:5%,start
The mall is practically empty.

00:23:01.413 --> 00:23:03.215 line:5%,start
There's not a soul in sight.

00:23:03.281 --> 00:23:06.952 line:95%,end
So our post-Abby might be over
before it even starts.

00:23:08.053 --> 00:23:10.889 line:5%,start
It's competition day,
and we're here in Fort Wayne, Indiana.

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:12.891 line:95%,end
Hi!

00:23:12.958 --> 00:23:14.393 line:95%,end
[cheering]

00:23:14.459 --> 00:23:16.061 line:95%,end
This is huge for me.

00:23:16.128 --> 00:23:20.132 line:95%,end
We are debuting the new
Abby Lee Dance Company competition team,

00:23:20.198 --> 00:23:22.534 line:95%,end
and they have to win and win big.

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:27.205 line:95%,end
Do you know any of these kids?
Because those are none of our kids.

00:23:27.272 --> 00:23:29.241 line:95%,end
YVETTE: I mean, I knew she
had auditions two weeks ago.

00:23:29.307 --> 00:23:30.308 line:95%,end
Right.

00:23:31.243 --> 00:23:32.244 line:5%,start
ABBY LEE MILLER: How are you?

00:23:33.378 --> 00:23:35.380 line:5%,start
ABBY LEE MILLER: Good. No hug, no kiss?

00:23:35.447 --> 00:23:38.316 line:95%,end
- HADLEY: Nice to see you again.
- Good to see you, sweetie.

00:23:38.383 --> 00:23:40.352 line:95%,end
You've been working on those feet?
- Yes.

00:23:40.419 --> 00:23:41.720 line:95%,end
Good, good, good. How are you?

00:23:41.787 --> 00:23:43.889 line:95%,end
- I'm good. How are you?
- ABBY LEE MILLER: Good.

00:23:43.955 --> 00:23:46.091 line:95%,end
- Take care.
- You have a new team?

00:23:46.158 --> 00:23:48.827 line:95%,end
Yeah, you know, every once in a while,
you have to put the trash out.

00:23:50.495 --> 00:23:53.198 line:5%,start
KELLY: All right.
Everybody get into your spots.

00:23:53.265 --> 00:23:56.101 line:95%,end
Let's go.
We're going to run out of time, guys.

00:23:56.168 --> 00:23:58.437 line:95%,end
SONG: (SINGING) Find a way
to make it all make sense.

00:23:58.503 --> 00:24:00.539 line:95%,end
Give myself more time to breathe.

00:24:00.605 --> 00:24:01.673 line:95%,end
I gotta have it all.

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:03.041 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: You can't look confused there,
Chloe.

00:24:03.108 --> 00:24:05.010 line:95%,end
No, you guys are all off.

00:24:05.076 --> 00:24:07.913 line:95%,end
Find a window.
No one should be behind anybody.

00:24:07.979 --> 00:24:09.915 line:95%,end
KELLY: Do a pose at the end.

00:24:09.981 --> 00:24:13.018 line:95%,end
I think this performance will
be a huge statement to Abby.

00:24:13.084 --> 00:24:16.488 line:5%,start
All the talent that she let walk
out the door was a big mistake.

00:24:16.555 --> 00:24:19.391 line:95%,end
We need to make this performance amazing.

00:24:25.964 --> 00:24:27.399 line:5%,start
ABBY LEE MILLER:
Ally listen to me.

00:24:27.466 --> 00:24:29.367 line:95%,end
Last week, you were part of a team,

00:24:29.434 --> 00:24:32.504 line:95%,end
a championship overall high school
winning team,

00:24:32.571 --> 00:24:34.039 line:95%,end
and they abandoned you.

00:24:34.105 --> 00:24:35.907 line:95%,end
So you're on your own, kiddo.

00:24:35.974 --> 00:24:37.209 line:95%,end
Make it count.

00:24:37.542 --> 00:24:39.845 line:95%,end
This is an important solo for Ally.

00:24:39.911 --> 00:24:43.648 line:95%,end
Last week, she was superb
in the group number.

00:24:43.715 --> 00:24:45.417 line:95%,end
But now, she's on her own.

00:24:47.919 --> 00:24:49.154 line:95%,end
OK.

00:24:49.221 --> 00:24:52.991 line:5%,start
Kaeli wants to show her
that she is a good dancer,

00:24:53.058 --> 00:24:54.259 line:95%,end
she's a good soloist.

00:24:54.326 --> 00:24:58.230 line:95%,end
But I think that she's very concerned
about impressing Miss Abby.

00:24:58.296 --> 00:25:01.833 line:95%,end
I'm going to go down to the front lobby

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:04.035 line:95%,end
and see if they'll let me
get a solo in for you.

00:25:04.102 --> 00:25:05.370 line:95%,end
Is that OK?

00:25:09.441 --> 00:25:11.510 line:5%,start
Just start running through it
and make sure that you know.

00:25:11.576 --> 00:25:12.544 line:95%,end
Start warming up, all right?

00:25:12.611 --> 00:25:14.613 line:95%,end
And I'll see what I can find out.
All right?

00:25:14.679 --> 00:25:19.117 line:95%,end
I want Kaeli to have a solo because I want
to show Abby what she could do.

00:25:19.718 --> 00:25:21.253 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER:
Sophia, listen to me.

00:25:21.319 --> 00:25:24.256 line:95%,end
This isn't just about Hadley.
You're going to beat Hadley.

00:25:24.322 --> 00:25:27.526 line:95%,end
This goes back to Maddie,
this goes back to Chloe.

00:25:27.592 --> 00:25:32.264 line:95%,end
If they were here right now, they would
be the ones going up against Hadley.

00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:34.199 line:5%,start
JACKIE: I'm not sure if it's
a lot of pressure for Sophia

00:25:34.266 --> 00:25:35.800 line:5%,start
to fill Maddie's shoes.

00:25:35.867 --> 00:25:39.337 line:5%,start
I think that Sophia as a dancer
in her own right

00:25:39.404 --> 00:25:41.706 line:95%,end
has her own style and
her own strengths.

00:25:41.773 --> 00:25:42.974 line:95%,end
It's like apples and oranges.

00:25:43.041 --> 00:25:45.243 line:95%,end
All right, we got to get rolling.

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:46.378 line:95%,end
Come on. We got to go.

00:25:46.444 --> 00:25:47.779 line:95%,end
First up are the solos.

00:25:47.846 --> 00:25:51.683 line:95%,end
Ally and Sophia better prove to me
that they have what it takes

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:55.086 line:95%,end
to be part of the 
Abby Lee Dance Company competition team.

00:25:55.153 --> 00:25:56.988 line:95%,end
They better not disappoint me.

00:25:58.356 --> 00:26:01.359 line:95%,end
[intense music]

00:26:10.869 --> 00:26:14.039 line:95%,end
PA: Ladies and gentlemen,

00:26:14.105 --> 00:26:17.909 line:5%,start
here is Ally with "Forever and a Day."

00:35:54.418 --> 00:35:58.923 line:5%,start
number 27, New Reality.

00:35:58.990 --> 00:35:59.991 line:5%,start
Woo!

00:36:00.558 --> 00:36:01.792 line:95%,end
Good job, [inaudible].

00:36:01.859 --> 00:36:02.927 line:95%,end
Woo!

00:36:03.794 --> 00:36:05.963 line:95%,end
Hadley wasn't exactly roadkill.

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:10.401 line:95%,end
She was just the road,
and Sophia drove right over her.

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:14.005 line:95%,end
Good job, girls!

00:36:14.572 --> 00:36:18.176 line:95%,end

And in first place,
entry number 56, Criminal of Love.


00:36:48.606 --> 00:36:53.444 line:95%,end
I was mortified when that group number
from Thrive beat us.

00:36:53.511 --> 00:36:54.845 line:95%,end
I mean, come on.

00:36:54.912 --> 00:36:58.916 line:95%,end
Hadley, Yvette,
her kids do not deserve to win.

00:37:02.186 --> 00:37:04.755 line:95%,end
It was an amazing day.

00:37:04.822 --> 00:37:08.192 line:95%,end
I'm on Cloud nine,
and so is Thrive Dance Company.

00:37:08.259 --> 00:37:09.460 line:95%,end
What an accomplishment.

00:37:09.527 --> 00:37:11.696 line:95%,end
Congratulations.

00:37:12.363 --> 00:37:13.931 line:95%,end
Congrats.
- What a competition.

00:37:13.998 --> 00:37:16.100 line:95%,end
- What a great competition.
- Yeah, no, they were great.

00:37:16.167 --> 00:37:17.268 line:95%,end
They were great.

00:37:17.335 --> 00:37:18.703 line:95%,end
Your kids were great as well.

00:37:18.769 --> 00:37:21.172 line:95%,end
You know, I think we make a great team.

00:37:21.239 --> 00:37:22.573 line:95%,end
You scare me.

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:23.641 line:95%,end
- No way.
- Oh, no.

00:37:23.708 --> 00:37:25.843 line:95%,end
Hadley, I figured out our bond.

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:27.445 line:95%,end
The daughters of dance teachers.

00:37:27.511 --> 00:37:28.412 line:95%,end
- That's right.
- I know.

00:37:28.479 --> 00:37:29.714 line:95%,end
See?
- YVETTE: Oh, we see it. That's it.

00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:31.382 line:95%,end
- See?
- Aw.

00:37:32.016 --> 00:37:33.918 line:95%,end
- If you're not in it to win it--
- You're in the way.

00:37:33.985 --> 00:37:36.320 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: You're in the way.
See, I know your things now.

00:37:37.154 --> 00:37:38.689 line:95%,end
So I can do them with her.

00:37:38.756 --> 00:37:39.757 line:95%,end
Yes?
- All right.

00:37:41.092 --> 00:37:44.095 line:95%,end
[cheering]

00:37:46.564 --> 00:37:48.766 line:95%,end
Hi!

00:37:50.301 --> 00:37:54.672 line:95%,end
I would like to introduce
Chloe, Maddie, Brooke,

00:37:54.739 --> 00:37:59.010 line:95%,end
Paige, and [inaudible]
Kendall, and [inaudible]..

00:37:59.076 --> 00:38:00.911 line:95%,end
Thank you for coming!

00:38:00.978 --> 00:38:03.981 line:95%,end
[MUSIC - LEE BAKER &amp; LAURA
VANE, "PUSH UP THE BEAT"]

00:38:06.183 --> 00:38:09.220 line:95%,end
(SINGING) There are days when
I'm down on the floor

00:38:09.287 --> 00:38:11.022 line:95%,end
and all I do is smile.

00:38:11.455 --> 00:38:14.592 line:95%,end
Drifting into weeks or more when
I don't touch base with myself.

00:38:14.659 --> 00:38:18.029 line:95%,end
And I find a way to
make it all make sense.

00:38:18.095 --> 00:38:20.431 line:95%,end
Give myself more time to breathe.

00:38:20.498 --> 00:38:22.733 line:95%,end
Gotta have it all, gotta manage my life,

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:25.403 line:95%,end
but I keep on thinking.

00:38:25.469 --> 00:38:29.573 line:95%,end
Shake up the day
and we kick into play

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:32.209 line:95%,end
until the night turns into day.

00:38:32.276 --> 00:38:33.678 line:95%,end
Push up the beat.

00:38:33.744 --> 00:38:35.613 line:95%,end
Keep it moving.

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.915 line:95%,end
You can tell me that
I'm missing the point.

00:38:37.982 --> 00:38:40.117 line:95%,end
We don't live too differently.

00:38:40.184 --> 00:38:44.188 line:95%,end
You ponder all the time you've
lost just to make ends meet.

00:38:44.255 --> 00:38:46.924 line:95%,end
And so we kick up our shoes.

00:38:46.991 --> 00:38:49.493 line:95%,end
And we let our hair loose.

00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:51.796 line:95%,end
There's only one thing left to do.

00:38:51.862 --> 00:38:53.197 line:95%,end
Push up the beat.

00:38:53.264 --> 00:38:54.965 line:95%,end
Keep it moving.

00:38:57.601 --> 00:39:00.604 line:95%,end
[cheering]

00:39:04.275 --> 00:39:05.242 line:95%,end
Yay!

00:39:06.177 --> 00:39:07.244 line:95%,end
You guys were [inaudible].

00:39:07.311 --> 00:39:09.814 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Oh, you did it!

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:11.182 line:95%,end
You did it!

00:39:11.248 --> 00:39:12.416 line:95%,end
You did it!

00:39:12.483 --> 00:39:14.785 line:95%,end
HOLLY: OK, how was it different
than doing it with Abby?

00:39:14.852 --> 00:39:15.886 line:95%,end
Was there any difference?

00:39:15.953 --> 00:39:17.154 line:95%,end
Yes.
It wasn't--

00:39:17.221 --> 00:39:20.257 line:95%,end
- Did anybody scream at you?
- GIRLS: No.

00:39:20.324 --> 00:39:21.759 line:5%,start
I am so proud of our girls.

00:39:21.826 --> 00:39:23.894 line:5%,start
I think their performance looked great.

00:39:23.961 --> 00:39:26.297 line:95%,end
And they did it all on
their own without Abby

00:39:26.364 --> 00:39:28.466 line:95%,end
and that is the most important part.

00:39:28.532 --> 00:39:32.169 line:95%,end
I know it wasn't what you would consider
your best performance,

00:39:32.236 --> 00:39:34.538 line:95%,end
but with the condition,
you did the best you could.

00:39:34.605 --> 00:39:36.040 line:95%,end
You should be proud of yourselves.

00:39:36.107 --> 00:39:37.775 line:95%,end
You pulled this together.

00:39:37.842 --> 00:39:41.212 line:5%,start
All in all, it was a great day,
but it revealed a lot.

00:39:41.278 --> 00:39:42.513 line:5%,start
The girls need discipline.

00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:44.115 line:5%,start
They need a dance teacher.

00:39:44.181 --> 00:39:46.717 line:95%,end
And it wasn't up to the standards
that we're used to.

00:39:47.418 --> 00:39:49.320 line:95%,end
I guess it's a lot to think
about right now.

00:39:49.687 --> 00:39:53.491 line:95%,end
Ally got second in her solo
and second in the group.

00:39:54.525 --> 00:39:56.994 line:95%,end
I mean, I don't know if
that impacted the group in some way

00:39:57.061 --> 00:40:01.132 line:95%,end
that if that's the best,
then Abby might have a real problem.

00:40:01.198 --> 00:40:06.137 line:95%,end
And I think right now to really
put a good posture forward here,

00:40:06.203 --> 00:40:08.773 line:95%,end
we might want to zip it in front the kids.
OK?

00:40:13.544 --> 00:40:14.612 line:95%,end
Ladies.

00:40:15.613 --> 00:40:16.480 line:95%,end
Second?

00:40:16.547 --> 00:40:19.583 line:95%,end
Second is not good enough
for the Abby Lee Dance Company,

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:22.052 line:95%,end
especially when it was Yvette.

00:40:22.119 --> 00:40:24.155 line:95%,end
Ally, could you tell
the girls bye and everybody?

00:40:24.221 --> 00:40:25.456 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: Wait.
Where are you going?

00:40:25.523 --> 00:40:27.291 line:95%,end
I'm just trying to give space.

00:40:27.758 --> 00:40:29.393 line:95%,end
Just trying to give some space.

00:40:30.928 --> 00:40:31.896 line:95%,end
Shelly cracked.

00:40:31.962 --> 00:40:34.665 line:95%,end
We saw the real Shelly,
and out the door she went.

00:40:34.732 --> 00:40:36.500 line:95%,end
See you later, Shelly.

00:40:37.535 --> 00:40:40.538 line:95%,end
So part of me is happy that you pulled
it together and everything,

00:40:40.604 --> 00:40:45.209 line:95%,end
but part of me is livid,
because it was Yvette and those kids.

00:40:46.343 --> 00:40:49.246 line:95%,end
So I am disappointed in the group.
Thank god for you, Sophia.

00:40:49.313 --> 00:40:50.314 line:95%,end
Thank god.

00:40:50.381 --> 00:40:52.950 line:95%,end
This team is just as disappointing
as the old one.

00:40:53.017 --> 00:40:54.518 line:95%,end
I have some tough decisions to make,

00:40:54.585 --> 00:40:56.554 line:95%,end
and not everybody is going to be happy.

00:40:58.589 --> 00:41:00.024 line:95%,end

WOMAN: (ON PHONE)
We went back to New Orleans.

00:41:01.525 --> 00:41:02.793 line:5%,start
This is my livelihood.

00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:04.128 line:5%,start
This is what I do.

00:41:04.195 --> 00:41:06.664 line:5%,start
I don't have a husband
that has a million dollar job.

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:08.833 line:5%,start
You give an inch, they take a yard.

00:41:08.899 --> 00:41:10.034 line:5%,start
It's over.

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:11.168 line:5%,start
I've had enough.

00:41:11.836 --> 00:41:13.871 line:5%,start
You are the only one left.

00:41:13.938 --> 00:41:15.706 line:5%,start
You need to win your division

00:41:15.773 --> 00:41:18.108 line:5%,start
and you need to win
the entire competition.

00:41:18.175 --> 00:41:20.077 line:5%,start
The only way she's
going to let your kids

00:41:20.144 --> 00:41:22.246 line:5%,start
back on that team,
she needs to hear it from your girls.

00:41:22.313 --> 00:41:24.515 line:5%,start
Oh, my god.

00:41:24.582 --> 00:41:25.850 line:5%,start
They're right there.
