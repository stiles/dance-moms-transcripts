ABBY: Previously on "Dance Moms"--

00:00:02.902 --> 00:00:07.340 line:5%,start
ABBY: You are in one of the world's
best places for entertainment.

00:00:07.407 --> 00:00:09.075 line:5%,start
Don't be shy. Don't be nervous.

00:00:09.142 --> 00:00:11.811 line:5%,start
Just act like you're talking
to your friends.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.849 line:5%,start
PAIGE: I can't breathe.
- You okay?

00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:17.083 line:5%,start
No. I can't breathe.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.086 line:5%,start
KELLY: She gets you so nervous
that you can't function.

00:00:20.153 --> 00:00:22.622 line:5%,start
Like, this is not right over dance class.

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:27.060 line:5%,start
ABBY: Kelly, you have driven the wedge
between your children and myself.

00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:31.197 line:5%,start
KELLY: No, Abby.
- I am the best thing for Paige!

00:00:32.065 --> 00:00:33.566 line:5%,start
ABBY: Coming up on "Dance Moms"--

00:00:33.633 --> 00:00:36.369 line:5%,start
We only have one more week
before Nationals.

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:39.706 line:5%,start
"Dance Spirit Magazine" contacted me.

00:00:39.773 --> 00:00:42.375 line:5%,start
KELLY: Oh, no!
CHRISTI: Oh, [bleep]. Oh. Oh.

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:44.411 line:5%,start
ABBY: You should be representing
the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:45.645 line:5%,start
Don't let me down this week.

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:48.615 line:5%,start
Nationals! Will you be the one
chosen to perform

00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:50.784 line:5%,start
or will you be the one
sitting in the audience?

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.053 line:5%,start
Let her run her number, Abby!
Then pick on her.

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.953 line:5%,start
Stop!

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.556 line:5%,start
Girls, one week until Nationals.

00:00:56.623 --> 00:00:59.626 line:5%,start
You know what it's going to be like
if the Abby Lee Dance Company loses?

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.129 line:95%,end
[theme music]

00:01:03.196 --> 00:01:06.633 line:95%,end
(SINGING) Get up. Get on the floor.

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:11.971 line:95%,end
My world is with my girls,
living on the dance floor.

00:01:12.806 --> 00:01:15.809 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:19.879 line:5%,start
ABBY: Come on, girls! Let's go!
Let's do it.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.782 line:95%,end
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:26.753 line:95%,end
I hope everybody had a good time
in Las Vegas. I know I did.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.520 line:95%,end
I did.

00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:33.026 line:95%,end
ABBY: I think, all things considered, the
Abby Lee Dance Company hit the jackpot.

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:35.695 line:95%,end
ANNOUNCER: First place
the Elite Junior Small Group,

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:38.298 line:95%,end
entry number 46, "Brat Pack."

00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:40.366 line:95%,end
[cheering and applause]

00:01:42.202 --> 00:01:43.336 line:95%,end
Okay.

00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:49.109 line:95%,end
Mackenzie, obviously, you weren't with us.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.613 line:95%,end
Next we have Paige.

00:01:56.516 --> 00:01:58.485 line:95%,end
Although the solo didn't work out
too well--

00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:01.921 line:95%,end
(SINGING) You are right by my side.

00:02:06.392 --> 00:02:08.328 line:95%,end
(CRYING) I worked so hard on this dance.

00:02:08.394 --> 00:02:09.696 line:95%,end
I know. I know.

00:02:09.762 --> 00:02:13.733 line:95%,end
--I thought you pulled it together and
you did a nice job in the group routine.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.001 line:95%,end
Thank you.

00:02:17.337 --> 00:02:20.707 line:95%,end
ABBY: Brooke, I don't think
what was in the number

00:02:20.773 --> 00:02:22.442 line:95%,end
showed off your assets.

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:27.814 line:95%,end
(SINGING) I believe now is my time.

00:02:31.284 --> 00:02:33.586 line:95%,end
God has given you a gift.

00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:36.022 line:95%,end
You can do things
that no one else can do.

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:37.790 line:95%,end
I'm not saying anything else.

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.765 line:95%,end
Nia, I thought all through rehearsal
you were outstanding.

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:49.335 line:95%,end
And then you stepped out on stage.

00:02:49.402 --> 00:02:54.841 line:95%,end
How did you go from looking
like you were shooting a movie

00:02:54.908 --> 00:02:59.112 line:95%,end
and you were the dance captain
to in the back corner,

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:01.981 line:95%,end
stage right, turning into oblivion?

00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:08.588 line:95%,end
I'm sorry. My hat messed me up.

00:03:09.722 --> 00:03:12.592 line:95%,end
ABBY: Nia, I was in the theater
when a man's hand was severed

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.429 line:95%,end
by a set coming down.

00:03:18.064 --> 00:03:20.200 line:95%,end
Nobody missed a beat of their dance.

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:22.936 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Do I expect Nia to dance
if her hat falls off?

00:03:23.002 --> 00:03:24.537 line:95%,end
Yes, Abby.


00:03:24.604 --> 00:03:28.474 line:5%,start
But Nia's hand gets chopped off,
she's going to stop dancing

00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:30.076 line:5%,start
and she's going to mess up
the group routine.

00:03:30.143 --> 00:03:33.313 line:5%,start
Next we have Kendall.

00:03:34.847 --> 00:03:37.650 line:95%,end
Kendall, it was your big audition
for Nationals.

00:03:38.818 --> 00:03:40.753 line:95%,end
You blew it.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.756 line:95%,end
Tell me what happened to that number.

00:03:43.823 --> 00:03:47.894 line:95%,end
Well, I just saw a couple of the solos
before me,

00:03:47.961 --> 00:03:50.997 line:95%,end
and they kind of got me nervous.

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:52.765 line:5%,start
What's wrong?

00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:56.135 line:95%,end
Well, you can't get nervous.
Don't get nervous.

00:03:56.202 --> 00:03:58.438 line:95%,end
Listen, do it for you.
Don't do it for her.

00:03:58.504 --> 00:03:59.906 line:95%,end
ABBY: That's why I always tell you guys,

00:03:59.973 --> 00:04:02.709 line:95%,end
when you step off the stage,
like, watch me.

00:04:02.775 --> 00:04:05.111 line:95%,end
I'm exiting and Holly's on next.

00:04:05.178 --> 00:04:08.514 line:95%,end
She's the next contestant to perform,
and I'm leaving the stage.

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:12.418 line:95%,end
And I fell out of my turns,
I put my hand down on my side aerial,

00:04:12.485 --> 00:04:15.188 line:95%,end
I was the worst I could have ever been.

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.626 line:95%,end
ABBY: Yes! Nailed it! Yes!

00:04:19.692 --> 00:04:22.161 line:95%,end
[laughter]

00:04:22.228 --> 00:04:25.098 line:95%,end
- I could so see you do that.
- I just freaked you out.

00:04:25.164 --> 00:04:27.033 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Yes, you did.
JILL: That was freaky.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.902 line:5%,start
ABBY: You don't want anyone to come off
and say, yes, I nailed it.

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:34.274 line:5%,start
There are tricks of the trade
that I have been using for decades.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.842 line:95%,end
Kendall should know better.

00:04:35.908 --> 00:04:39.879 line:95%,end
When you're standing in the wings,
you don't watch the soloist before you.

00:04:41.381 --> 00:04:45.118 line:95%,end
Chloe. Chloe, you're kind of flying
under the radar this week.

00:04:45.184 --> 00:04:48.588 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: How is getting first place
and beating Zack two weeks ago

00:04:48.655 --> 00:04:50.156 line:5%,start
flying under the radar?

00:04:50.223 --> 00:04:53.793 line:5%,start
And you can't exactly win a solo
if you don't have a solo.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.030 line:95%,end
And you can't shine in a group dance
if you're stuck in the back row.

00:04:57.096 --> 00:05:00.199 line:95%,end
You definitely need to be more involved.

00:05:00.266 --> 00:05:03.269 line:95%,end
You should have fought
for that spot in the front line.

00:05:03.336 --> 00:05:05.972 line:5%,start
And next, Maddie.

00:05:07.173 --> 00:05:09.475 line:95%,end
You came out of that curtain blazing.

00:05:09.542 --> 00:05:13.212 line:95%,end
You had the style, you had the look,
you had the facial expressions.

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:15.381 line:95%,end
- Thank you.
ABBY: And you pulled the focus.

00:05:16.482 --> 00:05:20.987 line:95%,end
And on top of the pyramid today
is the invincible Asia.

00:05:21.054 --> 00:05:23.056 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:05:23.856 --> 00:05:26.492 line:95%,end
You have proven to be undefeated.

00:05:27.293 --> 00:05:30.063 line:95%,end
You are a champion,
and congratulations

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:32.332 line:95%,end
for another victory
in the Eight and Under category.

00:05:32.398 --> 00:05:34.400 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:05:36.402 --> 00:05:39.605 line:95%,end
We only have one more week
before Nationals.

00:05:39.672 --> 00:05:42.575 line:95%,end
And we are traveling
to Buffalo, New York,

00:05:42.642 --> 00:05:46.145 line:95%,end
where we will be attending In10sity Dance.

00:05:46.212 --> 00:05:50.116 line:95%,end
The group routine is a hoedown.

00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:52.885 line:95%,end
It's entitled "Country Cuties."

00:05:52.952 --> 00:05:58.191 line:95%,end
This is the week we attend Regionals,
to qualify for the national competition.

00:05:58.257 --> 00:06:01.194 line:95%,end
In addition, I'm not sure
who's going to get the solo.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:05.698 line:95%,end
So this week every girl
needs to give me 110%.

00:06:05.765 --> 00:06:09.001 line:95%,end
And the moms,
well, they better mind their Ps and Qs.

00:06:09.068 --> 00:06:11.637 line:95%,end
Mackenzie, you weren't here last week.

00:06:13.172 --> 00:06:15.842 line:95%,end
Asia was the soloist, Eight and Under.

00:06:15.908 --> 00:06:18.177 line:95%,end
She won the whole thing.

00:06:18.244 --> 00:06:20.079 line:95%,end
This week is your turn.

00:06:20.146 --> 00:06:22.682 line:95%,end
I have been really tough on Mackenzie

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:26.953 line:95%,end
ever since Asia came to Pittsburgh
to join the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:06:27.019 --> 00:06:28.721 line:95%,end
Good thing Melissa trusts me.

00:06:28.788 --> 00:06:32.425 line:95%,end
She realizes that I am teaching Mackenzie

00:06:32.492 --> 00:06:33.726 line:95%,end
the ways of the world.

00:06:33.793 --> 00:06:37.797 line:95%,end
You will be performing a solo entitled
"Reach For the Stars."

00:06:37.864 --> 00:06:39.265 line:95%,end
Ooh, cute.

00:06:39.332 --> 00:06:42.702 line:95%,end
ABBY: You don't have to far to reach.
The star is right next to you.

00:06:42.769 --> 00:06:44.771 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:49.542 line:95%,end
Maddie, you will perform a duet--


00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.278 line:95%,end
with Kendall.

00:06:52.345 --> 00:06:54.380 line:95%,end
[cheering and applause]

00:06:54.447 --> 00:06:57.517 line:95%,end
The name of your duet
is "Bodies Electric."

00:06:57.583 --> 00:07:00.153 line:95%,end
I've thought for quite a few weeks
that you are the kid

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:02.588 line:95%,end
to follow in Maddie's footsteps,

00:07:02.655 --> 00:07:04.690 line:95%,end
to be right on her heels.

00:07:04.757 --> 00:07:08.928 line:95%,end
Working with Maddie this week
should be a learning experience.

00:07:10.496 --> 00:07:14.901 line:95%,end
I'm giving you one more opportunity
to impress me before Nationals.

00:07:14.967 --> 00:07:17.403 line:95%,end
Don't let me down.

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:19.572 line:95%,end
Chloe, you will also be doing a duet.

00:07:20.239 --> 00:07:23.476 line:95%,end
Your duet partner this week is Asia.

00:07:26.078 --> 00:07:28.548 line:95%,end
Let's hope she doesn't
leave you in the dust.

00:07:29.415 --> 00:07:32.051 line:95%,end
Before I dismiss you all
and we start our warm up,

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:34.654 line:95%,end
we have one more exciting
thing happening this week.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:39.125 line:95%,end
"Dance Spirit Magazine"
has contacted me.

00:07:39.926 --> 00:07:44.297 line:95%,end
They want to do a story
on a day in the life

00:07:44.363 --> 00:07:46.599 line:95%,end
of an Abby Lee Dance Company member.

00:07:46.666 --> 00:07:48.668 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:07:49.669 --> 00:07:51.771 line:95%,end
Now I thought it would be unique

00:07:51.838 --> 00:07:55.675 line:95%,end
that they do this particular
elite competition team,

00:07:55.741 --> 00:07:58.678 line:95%,end
but they only want one dancer.

00:08:01.581 --> 00:08:03.649 line:95%,end
And they chose you, Maddie.

00:08:03.716 --> 00:08:05.718 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:08:07.453 --> 00:08:10.423 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Shocker! I would have loved
for Chloe to have had that chance.

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.392 line:95%,end
But, according to Abby,
she's too busy flying under the radar.

00:08:13.459 --> 00:08:17.363 line:95%,end
Moms, you can go upstairs,
sit on your butts, talk about me.

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:20.433 line:5%,start
[music playing]

00:08:21.901 --> 00:08:23.870 line:95%,end
Okay. Get your partner!

00:08:23.936 --> 00:08:25.671 line:95%,end
Well, you know, we haven't done

00:08:25.738 --> 00:08:28.074 line:95%,end
a hoedown country style,
I don't think ever.

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:30.610 line:95%,end
I think we should all wear cowboy hats,
but I'm not going to wear boots.

00:08:30.676 --> 00:08:32.478 line:95%,end
I'm still going wear my stilettos.

00:08:32.545 --> 00:08:35.181 line:5%,start
JILL: Oh, I got the best cowboy boots!

00:08:35.248 --> 00:08:38.751 line:5%,start
Paige is too piked over in her strata jump
get your legs up higher.

00:08:38.818 --> 00:08:40.586 line:95%,end
This week we're doing hoedown,

00:08:40.653 --> 00:08:42.922 line:95%,end
and the name of the piece
is "Country Cuties."

00:08:42.989 --> 00:08:46.859 line:95%,end
Now it may seem like just a fun,
upbeat routine.

00:08:46.926 --> 00:08:50.997 line:95%,end
But this is loaded with tricks,
partner work,

00:08:51.063 --> 00:08:53.766 line:95%,end
and you have to have a lot of stamina.

00:08:53.833 --> 00:08:56.035 line:95%,end
Push!

00:08:56.102 --> 00:08:58.938 line:95%,end
I need the type of routine
that's going to guarantee us

00:08:59.005 --> 00:09:01.741 line:95%,end
a spot in the national competition.

Four, five, six, seven, eight--

00:09:06.279 --> 00:09:08.748 line:95%,end
Oh, my God. Look at Paige.
She's like, I have Asia.

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:15.021 line:5%,start
I'm used to there being a lot
of gymnastics in Brooke's solos.

00:09:15.087 --> 00:09:18.991 line:95%,end
But in a group dance, there just is
so much acrobats in this,

00:09:19.058 --> 00:09:21.794 line:95%,end
like, everybody is just
flipping and flopping around.

00:09:21.861 --> 00:09:24.463 line:95%,end
- Oh.
- Oh!

00:09:25.431 --> 00:09:28.234 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Is Asia really that heavy?
HOLLY: Oh!

00:09:28.301 --> 00:09:31.037 line:95%,end
Look at Nia and Kendall.
Oh, my gosh!

00:09:31.103 --> 00:09:33.172 line:95%,end
JILL: Wow.

00:09:35.308 --> 00:09:37.310 line:95%,end
It's almost like she needs
to be a little bit lower.

00:09:37.376 --> 00:09:40.580 line:95%,end
KRISTIE: I know.
- Your daughter [bleep].

00:09:40.646 --> 00:09:42.982 line:95%,end
Oh, oh.

00:09:43.049 --> 00:09:45.952 line:95%,end
Look at her go! Look at this.
Look at this. Look at this.

00:09:46.018 --> 00:09:47.820 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Oh, my gosh.
JILL: Go!

00:09:47.887 --> 00:09:50.756 line:95%,end
Mackenzie is not doing this.

00:09:52.391 --> 00:09:53.960 line:95%,end
Look at her go!

00:09:55.728 --> 00:09:57.396 line:95%,end
[cheering]

00:09:57.463 --> 00:09:59.599 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I hope MacKenzie
doesn't fall in the group dance.

00:09:59.665 --> 00:10:03.536 line:5%,start
Walking on her hands for 48 counts
is such a hard move.

00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:07.440 line:95%,end
She's been nailing it in rehearsal,
but where it counts is on the stage.


00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.119 line:95%,end
RACHEL: Hi.
- Hi. How are you? I'm Melissa.

00:10:20.186 --> 00:10:21.754 line:95%,end
Come on in.
- Hi. I'm Rachel.

00:10:21.821 --> 00:10:24.256 line:5%,start
- Hi, Rachel. Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

00:10:24.323 --> 00:10:25.691 line:5%,start
Rachel Zar from "Dance Spirit."

00:10:25.758 --> 00:10:29.061 line:5%,start
MELISSA: "Dance Spirit Magazine"
is one of the biggest

00:10:29.128 --> 00:10:31.764 line:5%,start
dance magazines in the country.

00:10:31.831 --> 00:10:35.401 line:5%,start
I'm so excited that they chose Maddie
to be featured.

00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:36.836 line:95%,end
Words can't even describe it.

00:10:36.902 --> 00:10:38.704 line:95%,end
They really have to get ready for dance,

00:10:38.771 --> 00:10:40.539 line:95%,end
so do you want to go
and watch them get ready?

00:10:40.606 --> 00:10:42.441 line:95%,end
We're doing a day in the life,

00:10:42.508 --> 00:10:44.577 line:95%,end
so we want to see
what you normally do in the morning.

00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:46.512 line:95%,end
And we're just going to watch you do it.

00:10:46.579 --> 00:10:49.348 line:95%,end
"Dance Spirit Magazine"
is going to follow Maddie all day,

00:10:49.415 --> 00:10:51.984 line:95%,end
from the time she gets ready,
eats breakfast,

00:10:52.051 --> 00:10:54.120 line:95%,end
goes to dance class, goes to rehearsal.

00:10:54.186 --> 00:10:57.089 line:95%,end
It's amazing.
It's a great opportunity for her.

00:10:57.156 --> 00:10:59.959 line:95%,end
JILL: You have duet practice soon,
you know, so we have to hustle.

00:11:00.026 --> 00:11:02.061 line:95%,end
So no horsing around in here.

00:11:03.963 --> 00:11:06.132 line:95%,end
- Hello! Good morning!
MELISSA: Hi, Kendall.

00:11:06.198 --> 00:11:09.535 line:95%,end
JILL: Hey, we-- I left her dance bag
and her boots. And I have her stuff.

00:11:09.602 --> 00:11:11.303 line:95%,end
- Kendall, why don't you go upstairs?
JILL: Run upstairs. Go say hi.

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:13.773 line:95%,end
Take those, take Maddie's clothes
and grab your dance bag.

00:11:13.839 --> 00:11:16.042 line:95%,end
- Come here. Oh, I'm so excited.
- Do you want to--

00:11:16.108 --> 00:11:17.777 line:95%,end
- I have Maddie's stuff, too.
- Oh, okay.

00:11:17.843 --> 00:11:20.312 line:95%,end
- So "Dance Spirit's" here, as you know.
- Here, today?

00:11:20.379 --> 00:11:24.517 line:95%,end
Let's be honest. I'm not really here
to pick up Kendall's dance bag.

00:11:24.583 --> 00:11:28.054 line:5%,start
I know that "Dance Spirit" magazine,
the photographer's here.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:31.657 line:95%,end
And I want to see what's going on,
maybe get Kendall in a shot or two.

00:11:31.724 --> 00:11:34.393 line:95%,end
- Hi. Rachel, this is Jill.
- Oh, hello.

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:35.494 line:95%,end
- Rachel from "Dance Spirit."
- I'm Jill.

00:11:35.561 --> 00:11:37.430 line:95%,end
- It's so nice to meet you.
- It's so nice to meet you.

00:11:37.496 --> 00:11:39.565 line:95%,end
- She's my buddy.
- I was just showing--

00:11:39.632 --> 00:11:42.902 line:95%,end
'Cause this just came out. We did this two
months ago.

00:11:42.968 --> 00:11:44.937 line:95%,end
"Dance Track Magazine."
Are you familiar with it?

00:11:45.004 --> 00:11:47.139 line:95%,end
- Not really, no.
- Okay, yeah.

00:11:47.206 --> 00:11:51.977 line:95%,end
So it just came out, so what funny timing
that you guys are here.

00:11:52.044 --> 00:11:57.049 line:95%,end
I love Jill, but I know that she's not
here to pick up Kendall's dance bag.

00:11:57.116 --> 00:11:58.818 line:95%,end
'Cause we have dance at the same time

00:11:58.884 --> 00:12:01.353 line:95%,end
and I could just bring
the dance bag to dance.

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:04.390 line:95%,end
She's just being pushy.
She showed up.

00:12:04.457 --> 00:12:08.461 line:95%,end
She just can't accept that magazine
chose Maddie and not Kendall.

00:12:08.527 --> 00:12:10.262 line:95%,end
How did you pick?

00:12:10.329 --> 00:12:12.665 line:95%,end
We just called up Abby
and said that we wanted to follow--

00:12:12.732 --> 00:12:14.934 line:95%,end
do the life of a ALDC kid.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.770 line:95%,end
And, you know,
she said Maddie would be great.

00:12:17.837 --> 00:12:20.106 line:95%,end
But Abby sometimes
has blinders on for--

00:12:20.172 --> 00:12:22.675 line:95%,end
MELISSA: She does.
- For Maddie. Maddie, Maddie, Maddie.

00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:26.278 line:95%,end
It is what it is.
Lots of studios go through that.

00:12:26.345 --> 00:12:30.516 line:95%,end
And, you know what? If Kendall can be
even close to Maddie, I'll take it.

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:34.720 line:95%,end
Melissa's not threatened by me or Kendall
or anybody, for that matter.

00:12:34.787 --> 00:12:36.322 line:95%,end
She didn't feel one bit threatened.

00:12:36.388 --> 00:12:38.057 line:95%,end
It's so nice to meet you.
RACHEL: It's so to meet you.

00:12:38.124 --> 00:12:39.391 line:95%,end
- And we'll see you later at the studio.
- Okay.

00:12:39.458 --> 00:12:41.527 line:95%,end
I'm going to head back up there.
See you later.

00:12:41.594 --> 00:12:44.597 line:5%,start
[music playing]

00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:54.073 line:95%,end
Hi! How's it going?

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:56.242 line:95%,end
Nothing like company
first thing in the morning.

00:12:56.308 --> 00:12:58.310 line:95%,end
RACHEL: Hi, Abby.
- Hello. How are you? Good to see you.

00:12:58.377 --> 00:13:00.780 line:95%,end
RACHEL: Rachel Zar from "Dance Spirit."
So nice to meet you.

00:13:00.846 --> 00:13:03.249 line:95%,end
- Nice to meet you. How are you?
MELISSA: Good. How are you?

00:13:03.315 --> 00:13:06.519 line:95%,end
ABBY: "Dance Spirit Magazine"
is coming into town.

00:13:06.585 --> 00:13:09.855 line:5%,start
They're going to see
how the choreography process works

00:13:09.922 --> 00:13:13.159 line:5%,start
to get ready for a competition
every single weekend.

00:13:13.225 --> 00:13:14.560 line:95%,end
Hi!

00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:17.963 line:95%,end
A little too much fun going on here.
Let's go. Come on.

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:19.532 line:95%,end
JILL: okay, go.
ABBY: Come on. Come on. Come on.

00:13:19.598 --> 00:13:21.066 line:95%,end
Let's rock and roll.

00:13:21.901 --> 00:13:24.937 line:95%,end
So what's the plan for today?
Like, what is your role today?

00:13:25.004 --> 00:13:27.473 line:95%,end
Are you, like, a fly on the wall?
Are you going to--

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:31.977 line:95%,end
Basically, yeah, fly on the wall doing
it's a day in the life photo essay.

00:13:32.044 --> 00:13:37.082 line:95%,end
So we just kind of want to see, like, you
know, how crazy it is, how hectic it is.

00:13:37.149 --> 00:13:39.285 line:95%,end
Also that these are normal kids, you know?

00:13:39.351 --> 00:13:41.353 line:95%,end
We want to make sure to show--
and that's-- you know,

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:44.490 line:95%,end
that's why we were at Melissa's house
this morning seeing, you know--

00:13:44.557 --> 00:13:46.158 line:95%,end
RACHEL: --the kids just being kids.

00:13:46.225 --> 00:13:48.828 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: How did you choose Maddie?

00:13:48.894 --> 00:13:52.198 line:95%,end
RACHEL: It was a mutual decision with
us and Abby. I mean--

00:13:52.264 --> 00:13:54.767 line:95%,end
KRISTIE: So are you going
to be looking at other girls to feature

00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:57.837 line:95%,end
or are you here just
for the following of Maddie?

00:13:57.903 --> 00:14:01.941 line:95%,end
Today we're just here to do
a day in the life of Maddie.

00:14:02.007 --> 00:14:04.243 line:95%,end
All right. Well, you go have
your day in the life

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:07.246 line:5%,start
and we're going to go have ours.

00:14:07.313 --> 00:14:09.415 line:5%,start
Five, six, seven, eight.

00:14:09.481 --> 00:14:12.852 line:5%,start
And one and two
and three and four.

00:14:12.918 --> 00:14:15.254 line:95%,end
We are one week away from Nationals.

00:14:15.321 --> 00:14:19.725 line:95%,end
So I'm using this trip to Buffalo
as a dress rehearsal,


00:14:19.792 --> 00:14:22.494 line:95%,end
so I can decide who actually
is going to be representing

00:14:22.561 --> 00:14:24.964 line:95%,end
the ALDC at Nationals.

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:28.000 line:95%,end
Boy, you best get home.

00:14:28.067 --> 00:14:29.568 line:95%,end
JILL: So how did that go this morning?

00:14:29.635 --> 00:14:32.104 line:95%,end
MELISSA: She wants a day
in the life of a dancer,

00:14:32.171 --> 00:14:36.141 line:95%,end
like an ALDC dancer, like, how they get
ready at home, what they really do.

00:14:36.208 --> 00:14:37.309 line:95%,end
Are they normal kids?

00:14:37.376 --> 00:14:38.911 line:95%,end
HOLLY: So it could've been
any one of the girls.

00:14:38.978 --> 00:14:41.280 line:95%,end
JILL: Right. They're all normal
ALDC dancers.

00:14:41.347 --> 00:14:45.584 line:95%,end
Well, I know that. But I'm just telling
you, it's not because, you know--

00:14:45.651 --> 00:14:48.287 line:95%,end
- It's because Abby picked her.
- No. But, Melissa, it is.

00:14:48.354 --> 00:14:50.556 line:95%,end
Because if it could have been
any of the kids

00:14:50.623 --> 00:14:53.092 line:95%,end
and Abby had a choice,
of course, she's going to pick Maddie.

00:14:53.158 --> 00:14:56.228 line:95%,end
If you wanted a typical day
in the life of an ALDC dancer,

00:14:56.295 --> 00:14:58.597 line:95%,end
you don't pick Maddie.
Because her life isn't typical.

00:14:58.664 --> 00:15:02.067 line:95%,end
Like, she isn't treated
the same way everyone else is.

00:15:02.134 --> 00:15:03.936 line:95%,end
Like, if you wanted to see
how the kids are treated,

00:15:04.003 --> 00:15:08.340 line:95%,end
follow, like, one of the kids that
doesn't have it, like, sugar coated.

00:15:09.275 --> 00:15:12.311 line:5%,start
KELLY: This article isn't about
who's the best dancer.

00:15:12.378 --> 00:15:13.812 line:5%,start
It's about control.

00:15:13.879 --> 00:15:16.248 line:95%,end
Abby knows, by picking
Melissa and Maddie,

00:15:16.315 --> 00:15:19.952 line:95%,end
she can control what they say
and what goes into this article.

00:15:20.019 --> 00:15:23.022 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:15:28.994 --> 00:15:31.330 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Look. Abby's showboating
for the photographer.

00:15:31.397 --> 00:15:32.398 line:95%,end
Look at me! I dance!

00:15:32.464 --> 00:15:34.266 line:95%,end
This is not the life
of the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:15:34.333 --> 00:15:37.703 line:95%,end
'Cause if it was, Abby would be sitting
on that mat back there.

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:40.172 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Screaming at people.
Point your feet!

00:15:41.273 --> 00:15:43.642 line:95%,end
KRISTIE: She's been really good
this week with the girls.

00:15:43.709 --> 00:15:45.577 line:95%,end
She's not going to act like a lunatic
with the guests.

00:15:45.644 --> 00:15:46.712 line:95%,end
CHRISTIE: Keep the guests!

00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:48.914 line:95%,end
KELLY: I think they should write
a different article every week

00:15:48.981 --> 00:15:51.283 line:95%,end
about each kid,
and we'll just keep repeating

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:52.584 line:95%,end
so they're in there, so she behaves.

00:15:52.651 --> 00:15:55.154 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Yeah!
MELISSA: Good pointing, Chloe. Good one.

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:58.057 line:95%,end
I'm going to let you go for now.
We have one more day tomorrow.

00:15:58.123 --> 00:16:00.125 line:95%,end
- Go.
- Bye. Thank you.

00:16:00.192 --> 00:16:02.161 line:5%,start
ABBY: Buffalo, New York!

00:16:03.662 --> 00:16:06.131 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Oh, thank you!
- Thank you!

00:16:06.198 --> 00:16:08.600 line:95%,end
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you so much, Melissa.

00:16:08.667 --> 00:16:10.669 line:95%,end
This was so much fun.
And thank you, everyone.

00:16:10.736 --> 00:16:13.172 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Thank you. Thank you.
HOLLY: You're welcome.

00:16:13.238 --> 00:16:15.240 line:95%,end
MELISSA: It was fun.
JILL: Have a safe trip back.

00:16:15.307 --> 00:16:17.710 line:95%,end
- Okay. Thank you.
- Bye-bye.

00:16:17.776 --> 00:16:19.411 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Bye-bye.
JILL: Thank you, guys.

00:16:19.478 --> 00:16:23.582 line:5%,start
ABBY: Maddie and Kendall, let's go.
Second, arms.

00:16:23.649 --> 00:16:26.752 line:5%,start
Kendall and Maddie's duet--
I know it's going to be a great number.

00:16:26.819 --> 00:16:29.521 line:95%,end
The whole beginning is Maddie,
by herself.

00:16:29.588 --> 00:16:32.057 line:95%,end
But can Kendall keep up
her end of the bargain?

00:16:32.791 --> 00:16:36.795 line:95%,end
If not, Maddie will do it as a solo.
It's fine.

00:16:37.663 --> 00:16:40.032 line:95%,end
KELLY: Isn't a duet
supposed to be side by side? Why--

00:16:40.099 --> 00:16:42.434 line:95%,end
You know, because it looks like
she's just following her around.

00:16:42.501 --> 00:16:45.604 line:95%,end
ABBY: Run, run, run, run, run, run.
Up, down.

00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:49.141 line:95%,end
I know why. Because Maddie
always gets more than everybody.

00:16:49.208 --> 00:16:55.314 line:95%,end
I'm anxious. I don't know what Abby has
in mind with this Kendall-Maddie duet.

00:16:55.381 --> 00:16:59.718 line:95%,end
Is it because Maddie doesn't have a solo,
so she has to make sure

00:16:59.785 --> 00:17:03.088 line:95%,end
that this duet is all about Maddie?
I'm really anxious.

00:17:03.155 --> 00:17:04.990 line:95%,end
- Just me.
- Just Jill.

00:17:05.057 --> 00:17:08.627 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Oh, she asked you to go downstairs.
Oh, that's good.

00:17:10.763 --> 00:17:12.431 line:95%,end
JILL: I'm glad that
Abby's calling me down.

00:17:12.498 --> 00:17:14.266 line:95%,end
I want to know
what's going on

00:17:14.333 --> 00:17:19.371 line:95%,end
and why Kendall is in the background
of the duet and Maddie's in the front.

00:17:19.438 --> 00:17:24.276 line:95%,end
ABBY: Now, Jill,
this is a huge opportunity.

00:17:24.343 --> 00:17:26.945 line:95%,end
I know that they've had duets before,

00:17:27.012 --> 00:17:28.814 line:95%,end
but Maddie's not the same dancer
she was before.

00:17:28.881 --> 00:17:31.917 line:95%,end
JILL: But where does Kendall stand?
So I know this is her opportunity.

00:17:31.984 --> 00:17:36.488 line:95%,end
Two things can happen. The positive is
that Kendall goes on stage,

00:17:36.555 --> 00:17:39.658 line:95%,end
rises to the occasion
and matches Maddie.

00:17:39.725 --> 00:17:40.692 line:95%,end
Right.

00:17:40.759 --> 00:17:45.064 line:95%,end
What cannot happen,
what I won't allow to happen,

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:49.435 line:95%,end
is Kendall goes on stage
and tarnishes Maddie's reputation.

00:17:49.501 --> 00:17:52.204 line:95%,end
I just want you to know
that if your kid steps out there--

00:17:52.271 --> 00:17:54.640 line:95%,end
She can rise to the occasion.
She's done it before.

00:17:54.706 --> 00:17:56.642 line:95%,end
This is a contemporary dance.

00:17:57.843 --> 00:18:01.246 line:95%,end
But is it choreographed to be
a winning number?

00:18:01.313 --> 00:18:03.515 line:95%,end
- Is it choreographed to--
- You know what?

00:18:03.582 --> 00:18:05.150 line:95%,end
JILL: No, no. No.
- That is so insulting.

00:18:05.217 --> 00:18:07.586 line:95%,end
- You're talking about concept.
ABBY: Out! Out you go.

00:18:07.653 --> 00:18:09.321 line:95%,end
- Let me finish my sentence.
- Goodbye! You're finished.

00:18:09.688 --> 00:18:13.358 line:95%,end
You just questioned, was my choreography
supposed to be winning.

00:18:13.425 --> 00:18:16.028 line:95%,end
JILL: No. I didn't, Abby.
- Yes. It is supposed to be winning.

00:18:16.095 --> 00:18:18.464 line:95%,end
And if everybody looked like Maddie,
they would win.

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:20.999 line:95%,end
- Out of the room, Jill. Go. Go.
- Well, you misunderstood.

00:18:21.066 --> 00:18:22.968 line:95%,end
- You can put words in my mouth, Abby.
- No, I didn't misunderstand.

00:18:23.035 --> 00:18:26.605 line:95%,end
Are you choreographing a winning number?
That's what I heard.


00:18:30.676 --> 00:18:32.945 line:5%,start
Girls, we're going to Buffalo, New York.

00:18:33.011 --> 00:18:36.748 line:5%,start
This is our last competition
of the season.

00:18:36.815 --> 00:18:40.285 line:95%,end
Next week is Nationals.
There's a lot riding on this week.

00:18:40.352 --> 00:18:44.656 line:5%,start
I still have not decided
who is going to perform at Nationals.

00:18:44.723 --> 00:18:46.859 line:5%,start
And the girls--
they need to understand

00:18:46.925 --> 00:18:51.330 line:5%,start
that every second they're
on the dance floor, I'm judging them.

00:18:51.396 --> 00:18:52.731 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: What is there to do in Buffalo?

00:18:52.798 --> 00:18:55.400 line:95%,end
The only thing I know about Buffalo
is chicken wings.

00:18:55.467 --> 00:18:57.636 line:95%,end
You know what?
Usually, at some point during the week,

00:18:57.703 --> 00:19:01.373 line:95%,end
you see a time when a dance
doesn't look like a hot mess.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.475 line:95%,end
- I have yet to see that time.
RACHEL: Agreed.

00:19:03.542 --> 00:19:06.411 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: I think it was a mess,
and I think it had no energy.

00:19:06.478 --> 00:19:09.047 line:5%,start
I'm not worried about the group dance,
at all.

00:19:09.114 --> 00:19:12.451 line:5%,start
All I can think about right now
is Maddie and Kendall's duet.

00:19:12.518 --> 00:19:14.052 line:95%,end
So what did you guys
think of the duet?

00:19:14.119 --> 00:19:16.889 line:95%,end
- Did you like it?
- Yeah. Now, do you love it?

00:19:16.955 --> 00:19:18.924 line:95%,end
Yeah, I do. I do. I think it's great.

00:19:18.991 --> 00:19:21.960 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Holly was pointing out that
all of your dreams have now come true.

00:19:23.028 --> 00:19:25.564 line:95%,end
You really wanted the opportunity
to dance with Maddie.

00:19:25.631 --> 00:19:29.201 line:95%,end
How stupid would you be not to want
your child to dance with Maddie?

00:19:29.268 --> 00:19:31.403 line:95%,end
So-- right?

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:33.172 line:95%,end
I don't really care if my child dances
with Maddie or not.

00:19:33.238 --> 00:19:34.940 line:95%,end
I just want my child to dance.

00:19:35.007 --> 00:19:37.776 line:95%,end
Wouldn't every one of you
want a dance with Maddie?

00:19:37.843 --> 00:19:40.045 line:95%,end
Usually, my daughter
was the old duet partner.

00:19:40.112 --> 00:19:41.847 line:95%,end
But I just think
there's a new changing of the guard.

00:19:41.914 --> 00:19:43.215 line:95%,end
- I think that Kendall will be her--
- No!

00:19:43.282 --> 00:19:45.751 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: No, no, Melissa.
Kendall will be her new go-to.

00:19:45.817 --> 00:19:48.487 line:5%,start
Is this part of Abby's grand plan
to phase Chloe out?

00:19:48.554 --> 00:19:51.557 line:5%,start
Because, if you ask me,
you can't phase Chloe out.

00:19:53.058 --> 00:19:55.394 line:95%,end
JILL: All the moms come down.
HOLLY: All the mom-- oh, gosh.

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:56.929 line:95%,end
That's never good.

00:19:56.995 --> 00:19:59.298 line:95%,end
I don't know why Abby's calling
all the mothers into the studio.

00:19:59.364 --> 00:20:02.367 line:95%,end
But I really hope
it's for her to yell at us.

00:20:02.434 --> 00:20:05.771 line:95%,end
I haven't been screamed at today.
I'm feeling a little empty inside.

00:20:05.837 --> 00:20:07.839 line:95%,end
ABBY: Hello. How you doing?
Hello. Good.

00:20:07.906 --> 00:20:11.009 line:95%,end
- How are you?
- I'm busy, busy, busy, busy, busy, busy.

00:20:11.076 --> 00:20:14.413 line:95%,end
I'm running the group routine
two dancers at the time.

00:20:14.479 --> 00:20:17.416 line:5%,start
Because we do partner work,
and I want to see

00:20:17.482 --> 00:20:20.118 line:5%,start
who's timing is on whose timing is off.

00:20:20.185 --> 00:20:22.187 line:5%,start
[music playing]

00:20:25.791 --> 00:20:27.326 line:95%,end
Point! Point!

00:20:31.163 --> 00:20:32.631 line:95%,end
Head, front!

00:20:32.698 --> 00:20:34.333 line:95%,end
(SINGING) I sat down on that bar stool.

00:20:34.399 --> 00:20:35.634 line:95%,end
ABBY: Smile, Brooke!

00:20:35.701 --> 00:20:38.837 line:95%,end
(SINGING) Johnny said
that she'd been here.

00:20:38.904 --> 00:20:45.077 line:95%,end
She left a little message
in case I should appear.

00:20:45.143 --> 00:20:48.447 line:95%,end
He said that she meant business.

00:20:48.513 --> 00:20:51.250 line:95%,end
ABBY: Sickled foot! Watch your alignment!

00:20:52.017 --> 00:20:54.486 line:95%,end
What is going on?

00:20:54.553 --> 00:20:57.522 line:95%,end
(SINGING) --boy, you best get home.

00:20:57.589 --> 00:20:59.091 line:95%,end
A fool and his--

00:20:59.157 --> 00:21:00.859 line:95%,end
ABBY: Watch your elbows!

00:21:03.762 --> 00:21:06.365 line:95%,end
(SINGING) The girl you take for granted

00:21:06.431 --> 00:21:09.334 line:95%,end
is going to leave you broken hearted.

00:21:10.369 --> 00:21:13.438 line:95%,end
ABBY: Don't let your arm cave in
on your head. Head front, Paige!

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:17.976 line:95%,end
Shut your feet.
Watch your alignment.

00:21:18.877 --> 00:21:22.080 line:95%,end
Your legs are supposed to be
perpendicular to the floor.

00:21:22.147 --> 00:21:24.850 line:95%,end
You will ruin the entire
number if you fall.

00:21:26.051 --> 00:21:29.221 line:95%,end
You threw yourself into that hand walk.

00:21:29.288 --> 00:21:32.591 line:95%,end
You didn't take your time
to kick up nice and controlled.

00:21:32.658 --> 00:21:35.193 line:95%,end
This group routine
should have been finished

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:38.096 line:95%,end
and clean the first day of rehearsal.

00:21:38.163 --> 00:21:42.567 line:95%,end
The girls know all these steps.
It's not that difficult, it s demanding.


00:21:42.634 --> 00:21:45.203 line:95%,end
And you have to work
with your partner and trust them.

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:47.406 line:95%,end
The timing has to be
right on the money.

00:21:47.472 --> 00:21:52.210 line:95%,end
I thought all the girls, like,
doing it with partners was a disaster.

00:21:52.277 --> 00:21:54.946 line:95%,end
- Oh, it was.
- I don't get it.

00:21:55.013 --> 00:21:58.183 line:5%,start
MELISSA: This "Country Cuties" number
is not perfect, yet.

00:21:58.250 --> 00:22:02.254 line:5%,start
But I trust Abby. And, hopefully,
it'll be cleaned up by competition.

00:22:02.321 --> 00:22:05.557 line:95%,end
ABBY: Chloe, last year, Nationals
was a big deal for you.

00:22:05.624 --> 00:22:09.094 line:95%,end
You did a great number.
It was innovative.

00:22:09.161 --> 00:22:12.964 line:95%,end
It was different.
You won a title, as well.

00:22:13.031 --> 00:22:15.467 line:95%,end
Asia, you haven't been with us
for a Nationals.

00:22:15.534 --> 00:22:18.437 line:95%,end
Are you going to continue
to be invincible,

00:22:18.503 --> 00:22:20.906 line:95%,end
unbeatable or is some
kid from somewhere

00:22:20.972 --> 00:22:23.675 line:95%,end
going to show up
and knock the wind out of your sails?

00:22:26.745 --> 00:22:30.015 line:5%,start
ABBY: Confident answer. All right, go.

00:22:30.082 --> 00:22:32.884 line:5%,start
[music playing]

00:22:32.951 --> 00:22:34.920 line:95%,end
So, Chloe, when you hear the music play
you think

00:22:34.986 --> 00:22:36.555 line:95%,end
everything's okay with the doll.

00:22:36.621 --> 00:22:38.890 line:95%,end
It's working. And you're happy.

00:22:39.591 --> 00:22:42.694 line:95%,end
Asia and Chloe are doing a routine
called "My Doll."

00:22:42.761 --> 00:22:46.965 line:95%,end
Chloe is the little girl,
and Asia is her doll.

00:22:47.032 --> 00:22:51.470 line:95%,end
And as Chloe winds up the doll,
the doll comes to life.

00:22:51.536 --> 00:22:52.671 line:95%,end
Turn that right knee out!

00:22:52.738 --> 00:22:56.007 line:95%,end
It's not a sweet, innocent, little doll.

00:22:56.074 --> 00:23:00.579 line:95%,end
The doll is possessed
and it starts to go after Chloe.

00:23:00.645 --> 00:23:04.483 line:95%,end
Asia, watch your feet
and your backs of your knees.

00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:06.118 line:95%,end
Lengthen your legs.

00:23:07.419 --> 00:23:11.289 line:95%,end
Up, down, down, glissade, jete, passe.

00:23:11.356 --> 00:23:12.924 line:95%,end
It's better than yesterday, but it's not--

00:23:12.991 --> 00:23:15.460 line:95%,end
KRISTI: You think?
- Yeah.

00:23:15.527 --> 00:23:17.362 line:95%,end
KRISTI: I don't know.
I don't even know what it is.

00:23:17.429 --> 00:23:19.865 line:95%,end
I-- and I normally can
watch and go, okay, I under--

00:23:19.931 --> 00:23:21.800 line:95%,end
like, because I'm taking myself
out of knowing.

00:23:21.867 --> 00:23:25.637 line:95%,end
Like, if I didn't know
Asia was the doll and she turned bad

00:23:25.704 --> 00:23:28.607 line:95%,end
and what's the thing,
I'm a little confused because I--

00:23:28.673 --> 00:23:30.776 line:95%,end
it's not in my face. I don't know, like--

00:23:30.842 --> 00:23:32.310 line:95%,end
and I'm acting
like I'm sitting here like a judge

00:23:32.377 --> 00:23:34.413 line:95%,end
watching two people, don't know the story.

00:23:34.479 --> 00:23:36.581 line:95%,end
I'm not feeling the story.
I'm just not feeling it.

00:23:36.648 --> 00:23:39.117 line:95%,end
If you're not feeling it for Asia,
are you feeling it for Chloe?

00:23:39.184 --> 00:23:39.918 line:95%,end
Not at all.

00:23:39.985 --> 00:23:43.088 line:95%,end
I think the whole Chloe-Asia
thing is just totally weird.

00:23:43.155 --> 00:23:46.258 line:95%,end
And I don't really want Chloe's,
you know, shot at Nationals

00:23:46.324 --> 00:23:48.960 line:95%,end
to be judged on this odd couple pairing.

00:23:49.961 --> 00:23:52.030 line:95%,end
ABBY: Come on, Mackenzie!
This is it.

00:23:52.097 --> 00:23:55.801 line:5%,start
If you don't win in Buffalo,
there's no chance at Nationals.

00:23:55.867 --> 00:23:57.736 line:5%,start
Push wind! Up!

00:23:58.403 --> 00:24:01.873 line:5%,start
Mackenzie's routine is called
"Reach For the Stars."

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:05.310 line:95%,end
Now her music is fun,
it's upbeat, it's exciting.

00:24:05.377 --> 00:24:09.981 line:95%,end
I'm hoping that Mackenzie realizes
she has to reach for the stars.

00:24:10.048 --> 00:24:13.051 line:95%,end
If she doesn't,
she's not doing a solo at Nationals.

00:24:13.118 --> 00:24:15.120 line:95%,end
It's going to be Asia all the way.

00:24:15.187 --> 00:24:17.589 line:95%,end
Head, front! Push!

00:24:17.656 --> 00:24:20.392 line:95%,end
Your leg needs to be out there
like Asia's was.

00:24:21.059 --> 00:24:22.294 line:95%,end
Tighten your knees!

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:23.662 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I'm worried about Mackenzie.

00:24:23.728 --> 00:24:26.631 line:95%,end
She is a big part in the group dance,
and a solo.

00:24:26.698 --> 00:24:30.101 line:95%,end
I know Mackenzie is worried because
she really wants to solo at Nationals.

00:24:30.168 --> 00:24:31.837 line:95%,end
I hope she can pull this off.

00:24:31.903 --> 00:24:33.905 line:95%,end
You grew up here in the studio.

00:24:33.972 --> 00:24:36.508 line:95%,end
You should be representing
the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:24:37.509 --> 00:24:39.211 line:95%,end
Asia's from 3,000 miles away.

00:24:39.277 --> 00:24:42.380 line:95%,end
If I'm going up against people
that are out to get me,

00:24:42.447 --> 00:24:44.483 line:95%,end
I have to use my best resources.

00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:48.320 line:95%,end

But Nationals are only one week away.

00:25:09.741 --> 00:25:13.144 line:5%,start
I'm going to watch every
move these girls make.

00:25:13.211 --> 00:25:15.580 line:5%,start

ABBY: All right.
We are all working for Nationals.

00:25:22.053 --> 00:25:25.824 line:95%,end
The worst possible scenario
is that I go out there

00:25:25.891 --> 00:25:28.827 line:95%,end
and I see all these other amazing kids

00:25:28.894 --> 00:25:31.196 line:95%,end
that I'd rather take to Nationals with me.

00:25:31.863 --> 00:25:35.767 line:5%,start
Nationals is the biggest week
of the whole entire year.

but we know better. Right?

00:26:02.394 --> 00:26:04.062 line:95%,end
Yeah, exactly.

So say whatever
if it makes you feel better.

It doesn't matter to me.

You haven't seen the best of me.

KRISTI: My biggest fear
of Asia and Chloe's duet

00:28:04.449 --> 00:28:07.719 line:5%,start
is that these judges will not
get the story.

00:28:07.786 --> 00:28:10.955 line:95%,end
I've seen it, and they've had great timing
this last rehearsal.


00:28:11.022 --> 00:28:14.526 line:95%,end

"My Doll."

ABBY: Asia and Chloe's duet
was a little rough around the edges.

00:29:37.575 --> 00:29:41.112 line:95%,end
I just think Chloe
was out-danced by Asia.

00:29:41.179 --> 00:29:44.482 line:95%,end
I think that doll
ran circles around Chloe.

of Chloe and Asia for going out there

to the best of their ability.

Jill, if you don't do
something about her posture,

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:13.711 line:95%,end
it's going to get so bad--

00:30:13.778 --> 00:30:15.580 line:95%,end
Kendall, just focus on
what you're doing right now.

00:30:15.647 --> 00:30:18.650 line:95%,end
- We'll discuss this later.
ABBY: Oh, yeah. Much later.

When she's in a back brace
because she can't stand up.

00:30:21.052 --> 00:30:23.721 line:95%,end
Can you let her run her number, Abby?
Let her run it.

00:30:23.788 --> 00:30:25.857 line:95%,end
A halter is the worst possible thing
on her.

00:30:25.924 --> 00:30:28.126 line:95%,end
JILL: Okay. Who did the costumes?
ABBY: Look at it.

00:30:28.193 --> 00:30:30.929 line:95%,end
You're another mother who's not owning up
to her kid's flaws.

00:30:30.995 --> 00:30:33.498 line:95%,end
JILL: Abby, I can't help her body
physique.

00:30:33.565 --> 00:30:36.467 line:95%,end
Let her run her number, Abby!
Then pick on her!

ABBY: I've told her to stand up straight.
- And so have I.

How many times a day?
At least-- how many?

00:30:41.606 --> 00:30:44.475 line:95%,end

JILL: How many, Kendall?

00:30:44.542 --> 00:30:47.612 line:5%,start
It is what it is, Abby.
The kids look great.

00:30:47.679 --> 00:30:50.181 line:5%,start
Kendall looks great in this number.

00:30:50.248 --> 00:30:54.452 line:95%,end
Leave her alone and let her dance
it like you've seen it all week.

00:30:54.519 --> 00:30:56.754 line:95%,end
Get over yourself.
I didn't trash your kid.

ABBY: Kendall, you better stand up
straight because I've had it!

Listen, baby, go out and you have fun.
Okay?

couldn't see the stars above me.

get a solo at Nationals.

But do you really have to
rub it in all of our faces?

Shall I bring up the fact that you're
wearing chaps now or later?

their fault, not your fault. okay?

00:35:04.302 --> 00:35:06.938 line:5%,start
Make some noise for "Country Cuties."

00:35:07.004 --> 00:35:09.006 line:95%,end
[cheering and applause]

00:35:11.776 --> 00:35:14.779 line:5%,start
[music playing]

00:35:23.821 --> 00:35:26.791 line:95%,end
(SINGING) I sat down on that bar stool,

00:35:26.858 --> 00:35:29.927 line:95%,end
Johnny said that she'd been here.

00:35:29.994 --> 00:35:36.300 line:95%,end
She left a little message
in case I should appear.

00:35:36.367 --> 00:35:39.303 line:95%,end
He said that she meant business.

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:42.206 line:95%,end
Then he took a somber tone.

00:35:42.273 --> 00:35:48.746 line:95%,end
He leaned across the bar
and whispered, "Boy, you best get home."

00:35:48.813 --> 00:35:53.117 line:95%,end
A fool and his honey are soon parted.

00:35:56.654 --> 00:36:00.858 line:95%,end
A fool and his honey are soon parted.

00:36:01.893 --> 00:36:06.364 line:95%,end
She's the best thing you got going
are soon parted.

00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:08.566 line:95%,end
Come on, Mackenzie.
Point your foot.

00:36:10.835 --> 00:36:12.737 line:95%,end
Oh.

00:36:15.973 --> 00:36:17.975 line:95%,end
[cheering and applause]

00:36:20.111 --> 00:36:22.213 line:95%,end
ABBY: Sure enough, she falls over.

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:25.016 line:95%,end
It looks ridiculous,
ruins the whole ending of the number.

00:36:25.082 --> 00:36:27.518 line:5%,start
- Are you okay,
- It's okay.

00:36:27.585 --> 00:36:29.820 line:95%,end
She probably did it 100 times
in the hallway and she's exhausted.


00:36:29.887 --> 00:36:31.956 line:95%,end
That's why I told them not
to have her run it 100 times.

00:36:32.023 --> 00:36:33.758 line:95%,end
She was out there without us.

00:36:35.726 --> 00:36:37.728 line:95%,end
- Make sure your hair is in--
- Abby's going to yell at me now.

00:36:37.795 --> 00:36:38.663 line:5%,start
MADDIE: It's okay.

00:36:38.729 --> 00:36:40.398 line:5%,start
MACKENZIE: I was really nervous with Abby

00:36:40.464 --> 00:36:43.134 line:5%,start
because I thought she was going
to yell at me because I fell.

00:36:48.206 --> 00:36:52.009 line:5%,start
We're going to start up from the Elite
Mini Solo division of competition.

00:36:52.076 --> 00:36:54.779 line:5%,start
Ladies and gentlemen,
your highest scoring Mini Soloist

By six points.

00:37:02.954 --> 00:37:04.956 line:95%,end
I'm so proud. I'm so happy.

00:37:05.022 --> 00:37:06.557 line:5%,start
But her little face looks so defeated

00:37:06.624 --> 00:37:08.559 line:5%,start
because she was so worried
about the group dance.

00:37:10.228 --> 00:37:12.496 line:95%,end
ANNOUNCER: All right. Moving now
into our Elite Junior

00:37:12.563 --> 00:37:15.099 line:95%,end

JILL: Maddie and Kendall get first place.

00:37:46.964 --> 00:37:50.835 line:95%,end
Words can't express
how happy I am for my little girl.

00:38:00.645 --> 00:38:01.612 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Seriously, Jill?

00:38:01.679 --> 00:38:03.848 line:5%,start
Did you really just look at me
and say that Chloe and Asia

00:38:03.914 --> 00:38:05.416 line:5%,start
should be glad that they got second

00:38:05.483 --> 00:38:07.585 line:5%,start
because there were really good dancers
here?

00:38:07.652 --> 00:38:10.254 line:5%,start
Well, what does that say
about what you think of them?

00:38:11.455 --> 00:38:14.191 line:5%,start
Now for our Elite Junior Small Groups.

00:38:14.258 --> 00:38:18.429 line:5%,start

"Country Cuties," from the Abby

[cheering and applause]

00:38:40.685 --> 00:38:44.221 line:95%,end
ABBY: Mackenzie is lucky
that this group won

00:38:44.288 --> 00:38:46.724 line:95%,end
the overall first place high score.

00:38:46.791 --> 00:38:49.427 line:95%,end
Mackenzie, you screwed
up this routine.

00:38:49.493 --> 00:38:53.397 line:95%,end
You better thank everybody
else for pulling their weight

00:38:53.464 --> 00:38:55.733 line:95%,end
and taking us to Nationals.

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:57.234 line:95%,end
[cheering]

00:38:57.301 --> 00:38:58.169 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Hello!

00:38:58.235 --> 00:39:00.805 line:95%,end
I, personally, am just really,
really thrilled,

00:39:00.871 --> 00:39:06.177 line:95%,end
as Jill pointed out, that Chloe and Asia
were able to pull off second place.

00:39:06.243 --> 00:39:08.446 line:95%,end
- That's not what I said, Christi.
CHRISTI: That is what you said.

00:39:08.512 --> 00:39:10.348 line:95%,end
- That's not what I said.
- That's exactly what you said.

00:39:10.414 --> 00:39:12.983 line:95%,end
- Well, okay, you can interpret it.
- That's exactly what you said.

00:39:13.050 --> 00:39:14.185 line:95%,end
- It was rude.
- So you're not happy with second.

00:39:14.251 --> 00:39:16.220 line:95%,end
You're pissed off you got second.
CHRISTI: No, I'm--

00:39:16.287 --> 00:39:17.988 line:95%,end
Well, then you should be happy
you got second.

00:39:18.055 --> 00:39:19.757 line:95%,end
- I am happy.
- --were really good dancers out there.

00:39:19.824 --> 00:39:21.892 line:95%,end
And I think that what you said was rude.

00:39:21.959 --> 00:39:24.295 line:95%,end
I didn't mean it rude.
You wanted it to be rude

00:39:24.362 --> 00:39:25.963 line:95%,end
because you're mad you came in second.

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:27.264 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: No. No, Jill.
- Face it. Yes.

00:39:27.331 --> 00:39:30.634 line:95%,end
I only reiterated what Christi
had been saying all week,

00:39:30.701 --> 00:39:32.903 line:95%,end
that this number wasn't competitive

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:35.473 line:95%,end
and she didn't care much
for the choreography.

00:39:35.539 --> 00:39:38.142 line:95%,end
She's just pissed that
they didn't come in first.

00:39:40.144 --> 00:39:42.413 line:95%,end
Congratulations!

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:45.216 line:95%,end
Now Nationals are next week.

00:39:45.282 --> 00:39:49.053 line:95%,end
I wanted to base who I chose at Nationals
on today's performance.

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:53.591 line:95%,end
Mackenzie, her solo was dynamite.
She was great.

00:39:53.657 --> 00:39:56.494 line:95%,end
Then, Mackenzie practiced
that over and over and over

00:39:56.560 --> 00:40:00.297 line:95%,end
when I said don't.
You're going to get tired.

00:40:00.364 --> 00:40:02.299 line:95%,end
And that's why she fell.

00:40:02.366 --> 00:40:04.635 line:95%,end
Asia and Chloe-- second.

00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:07.471 line:95%,end
Wouldn't a tie have been nice?

00:40:08.939 --> 00:40:10.941 line:95%,end
[cheering]

00:40:15.212 --> 00:40:18.649 line:95%,end
ABBY: Congratulations on the duets,
Mackenzie on your solo,

00:40:18.716 --> 00:40:20.317 line:95%,end
and the group.

00:40:20.985 --> 00:40:24.522 line:95%,end
Girls, one week until Nationals!

00:40:24.588 --> 00:40:28.626 line:95%,end
Dream it, eat it, breathe it, live it.

00:40:28.692 --> 00:40:32.696 line:95%,end
I thought I would have a very clean,
easy decision after the results today.

00:40:32.763 --> 00:40:38.135 line:95%,end
But I saw stuff on that stage
that I haven't seen go wrong in years.

00:40:39.503 --> 00:40:43.874 line:95%,end
But, I'll tell you what, I am not going
to go there and get beat by Miss Cathy,

00:40:43.941 --> 00:40:48.045 line:95%,end
that has as much talent
as I have in this fingernail.

00:40:48.112 --> 00:40:49.613 line:95%,end
You know what it's going to be like
for you guys

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:51.682 line:95%,end
if the Abby Lee Dance Company loses?

00:40:54.185 --> 00:40:55.619 line:95%,end
ABBY: Next, on "Dance Moms"--

00:40:55.686 --> 00:40:59.824 line:5%,start
We are here in New Orleans
to win at Nationals.

00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:03.294 line:5%,start
The Wicked Witch of the West
is here to beat you.

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:06.831 line:5%,start
CATHY: I got the creme de la creme.
This is Blake McGrath.

00:41:06.897 --> 00:41:11.135 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: I find it wrong that she would
give one of those solo spots to Payton.

00:41:11.202 --> 00:41:13.537 line:5%,start
KRISTIE: You know what? I'm not playing
this stupid game

00:41:13.604 --> 00:41:15.406 line:5%,start
that you guys like to play
with the manipulation.

00:41:15.473 --> 00:41:18.676 line:5%,start
- Great. You better settle it down.
- Bitch!

00:41:18.742 --> 00:41:20.811 line:5%,start
- You're a rude bitch--
- Don't you touch me.

00:41:20.878 --> 00:41:21.979 line:5%,start
Oh, turn around, bump.

00:41:22.046 --> 00:41:25.082 line:5%,start
There's no better revenge than victory.
