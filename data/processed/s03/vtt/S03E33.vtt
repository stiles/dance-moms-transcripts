ABBY (VOICEOVER):
Previously, on "Dance Moms."

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:04.004 line:5%,start
'Cause you're not really on the team.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:05.572 line:5%,start
I'm on this team.

00:00:05.638 --> 00:00:06.740 line:5%,start
Well, you weren't on the team back then.

00:00:06.806 --> 00:00:07.807 line:5%,start
But I am now.

00:00:07.874 --> 00:00:09.542 line:5%,start
I don't know what we're
going to do with her now.

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:10.844 line:5%,start
Aw.

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:13.480 line:5%,start
What are you here for?

00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:15.048 line:5%,start
For Asia to dance with the team,
or to learn from Abby?

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:16.883 line:5%,start
She did amazing in last week's crew.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.151 line:5%,start
Asia's already proved herself.

00:00:18.218 --> 00:00:20.353 line:5%,start
What I'm telling you is between you and I.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.555 line:5%,start
Right now, you are hurting my daughter.

00:00:22.622 --> 00:00:24.657 line:5%,start
I more a part of this team
than you will ever be.

00:00:24.724 --> 00:00:28.294 line:5%,start
When opportunity comes knocking,
you better take advantage of it.

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:29.396 line:5%,start
Shame on you.

00:00:30.797 --> 00:00:32.332 line:5%,start
ABBY (VOICEOVER):
Coming up on "Dance Moms."

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.733 line:5%,start
So is Abby here?

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.402 line:5%,start
- I don't know.
ABBY (ON PHONE): Gianna?

00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:36.970 line:5%,start
Abby?

00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:39.506 line:5%,start
One, two, three, Gia's girls.

00:00:39.572 --> 00:00:41.441 line:5%,start
- You're a fill-in.
- No, I'm here.

00:00:41.508 --> 00:00:44.878 line:5%,start
I texted her, and she said
you will be fired from this dance studio

00:00:44.944 --> 00:00:46.179 line:5%,start
if you choreograph that dance.

00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:47.981 line:5%,start
I don't care where the [bleep] she works.

00:00:48.048 --> 00:00:49.582 line:5%,start
Whoa, oh, oh.

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.885 line:5%,start
She has made it clear she doesn't care

00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:53.753 line:5%,start
about our kids or her team.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.522 line:5%,start
Brooke, there's nothing we can do.

00:00:55.588 --> 00:00:56.656 line:5%,start
[sniffling]

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:58.458 line:5%,start
Don't cry.
Come on.

[music playing]

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.263 line:5%,start
[theme music playing]

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.599 line:95%,end
Get up, get on the floor.

00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:09.436 line:95%,end
My world is with my girls.

00:01:09.502 --> 00:01:12.639 line:95%,end
Living on the dance floor.

00:01:12.705 --> 00:01:15.075 line:5%,start
[music playing]

00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:21.848 line:95%,end
Hi, G. Oh, it's cold in here.

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:23.216 line:95%,end
Good morning.

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:24.951 line:95%,end
GIANNA: Good morning, guys.
- Hi.

00:01:25.018 --> 00:01:26.820 line:95%,end
Good morning.

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:28.688 line:95%,end
GIANNA: Hey, girl.
- Where's your friend?

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:29.956 line:95%,end
Not here yet.

00:01:30.023 --> 00:01:31.057 line:95%,end
Ooh.

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:34.427 line:95%,end
- Hi, Gia.
GIANNA: Hi. Good morning.

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:37.530 line:95%,end
- Hello, Gia.
GIANNA: Hi.

00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:39.833 line:5%,start
I walk into the studio,
and Gia's sitting at the front desk,

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.769 line:5%,start
and I just assume that Abby's
at a headband sale somewhere.

00:01:43.403 --> 00:01:45.071 line:95%,end
- Yeah.
- Where's Ab, I wonder.

00:01:45.138 --> 00:01:47.540 line:95%,end
I don't know. I asked Gianna, I was like
hey, you're here by yourself.

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:49.075 line:95%,end
She was, yeah, Abby's not here yet.

00:01:49.142 --> 00:01:51.811 line:95%,end
Over the past three days
Mrs. Miller has not been well.

00:01:52.912 --> 00:01:54.414 line:95%,end
- Oh, you're kidding.
- Mnm-mnm.

00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:58.251 line:5%,start
Abby's mom is very, very ill,
and getting sicker and sicker

00:01:58.318 --> 00:02:00.186 line:95%,end
by the day.

00:02:00.253 --> 00:02:02.589 line:95%,end
But it's not like Abby not to show up,

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:04.991 line:95%,end
so I'm really concerned that
something's really wrong.

00:02:05.058 --> 00:02:07.360 line:95%,end
- So is Abby here?
- I don't know.

00:02:07.427 --> 00:02:09.429 line:95%,end
Is she going to come and
help with the rehearsal?

00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:11.931 line:95%,end
- Hey, Ab. It's Gia.
- And Rachel.

00:02:11.998 --> 00:02:13.800 line:95%,end
Just wondering where you were.

00:02:13.867 --> 00:02:18.404 line:95%,end
We have to order costumes
for the group dance in 44 minutes now,

00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:21.174 line:95%,end
because they're coming from St. Louis,
and there's a holiday tomorrow. So--

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:25.712 line:5%,start
--we don't know where you are,
but we hope you're on the way.

00:02:25.778 --> 00:02:28.581 line:5%,start
If Abby doesn't show up today,
I don't know what I'm going to do.

00:02:28.648 --> 00:02:31.684 line:5%,start
She has to pick costumes
and assign solos.

00:02:31.751 --> 00:02:33.086 line:95%,end
I can't make those decisions without her.

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:34.854 line:95%,end
She doesn't have to tell us
all of her personal details,

00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:36.256 line:95%,end
but if she's not going
to be here for pyramid,

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:39.392 line:95%,end
it's just professionalism, that's all.
She has a business.

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.362 line:95%,end
And it's not being harsh or cruel, just--

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:45.131 line:95%,end
I don't really know anything though,
so I don't have anything to tell them.

00:02:45.198 --> 00:02:48.101 line:95%,end
- Right.
- And so there's no pyramid today.

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:50.370 line:95%,end
Maybe you should start the group part,
since you know there's a group.

00:02:50.436 --> 00:02:52.305 line:95%,end
That's what I said.

00:02:52.372 --> 00:02:53.640 line:5%,start
- We need to cut it out.
- There she is.

00:02:53.706 --> 00:02:54.741 line:95%,end
GIANNA: Hi, guys.
- Hi.

00:02:54.807 --> 00:02:55.808 line:5%,start
Did you hear from Abby?

00:02:55.875 --> 00:02:57.210 line:5%,start
Okay. When you and Gia met.

00:02:57.277 --> 00:02:59.512 line:95%,end
I'm just going to start the group.
I have the group music.

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.014 line:95%,end
- Oh.
WOMAN: That's good.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.282 line:95%,end
It's called "Just Be."

00:03:02.348 --> 00:03:05.451 line:95%,end
It's pretty lyrical, it's not hard.

00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:07.320 line:95%,end
- And James is here to help me.
WOMAN: Oh.

00:03:07.387 --> 00:03:08.621 line:95%,end
So--

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:10.256 line:95%,end
WOMAN: Do you know where
we're going this weekend?

00:03:10.323 --> 00:03:14.794 line:95%,end
No. But wherever we're going, we have
to have a group dance, so--

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:15.995 line:95%,end
- So true.
- Okay.

00:03:16.062 --> 00:03:17.797 line:95%,end
- Come on.
- All right.

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:21.167 line:95%,end
Work hard, girls.
Be safe. Thank you, Gianna.

00:03:21.234 --> 00:03:23.903 line:5%,start
HOLLY: Still no Abby, but at least
we have Gia and James,


00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.672 line:5%,start
and they are Abby's best teachers.

00:03:25.738 --> 00:03:29.075 line:5%,start
And we also have a group song,
so I guess that's a start.

00:03:29.142 --> 00:03:31.344 line:95%,end
You guys do realize Abby's not here.

00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:32.879 line:95%,end
We don't know when she's coming.

00:03:32.946 --> 00:03:34.681 line:95%,end
I brought James in
special to help me today

00:03:34.747 --> 00:03:37.483 line:95%,end
because Abby's least not here.
Please pay attention.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.786 line:95%,end
You guys give Abby that respect,
so please give us that respect.

00:03:39.852 --> 00:03:40.954 line:95%,end
- Okay?
GIRLS: Okay.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.622 line:95%,end
Do we know the theme?
We don't know the theme.

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:44.023 line:95%,end
The theme is called, "abandoned".

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.560 line:95%,end
- Stop.
- What? It's true, we're abandoned.

00:03:47.627 --> 00:03:48.795 line:95%,end
- It's not called abandoned.
- It's all right.

00:03:48.861 --> 00:03:52.932 line:95%,end
It's called, "I left you on
the steps of a fire station

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:54.734 line:95%,end
in the little basket.
You're abandoned."

00:03:54.801 --> 00:03:58.338 line:95%,end
Abby always talks about loyalty
and dedication to the team,

00:03:58.404 --> 00:04:01.007 line:95%,end
and here are these kids
working their butts off,

00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:04.811 line:95%,end
and their teacher doesn't even
have the decency to show up.

00:04:04.877 --> 00:04:06.379 line:95%,end
I think the kids are fine with no pyramid.

00:04:06.446 --> 00:04:08.948 line:95%,end
However, I think they want
to know who's doing what.

00:04:09.015 --> 00:04:10.116 line:95%,end
Yeah, I agree with that.

00:04:10.183 --> 00:04:14.087 line:95%,end
Who's doing a solo,
where the heck are we going,

00:04:14.153 --> 00:04:17.757 line:95%,end
who are we going to go up
against, what what's going on?

00:04:17.824 --> 00:04:19.259 line:95%,end
I mean, that's what we
like pyramid most is--

00:04:19.325 --> 00:04:20.760 line:95%,end
- Right.
- --is to find out--

00:04:20.827 --> 00:04:21.861 line:95%,end
--it's an information session.

00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:22.929 line:95%,end
--what's happening.

00:04:22.996 --> 00:04:24.964 line:95%,end
Gia said that she was working
on the group dance, but what

00:04:25.031 --> 00:04:26.633 line:95%,end
about the other dances?

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:28.701 line:95%,end
You think Abby will give Gia the authority

00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:30.470 line:95%,end
to pass out solos and duets?

00:04:30.536 --> 00:04:32.705 line:95%,end
I don't think Gianna
would do anything on her own

00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:34.007 line:95%,end
without checking with Abby.

00:04:34.073 --> 00:04:36.109 line:95%,end
No, I don't either.
Maybe there aren't any, don't know.

00:04:37.243 --> 00:04:39.445 line:95%,end
WOMAN: Okay, who do you think has solos?

00:04:39.512 --> 00:04:40.680 line:95%,end
I think Payton's going to do a solo, too.

00:04:40.747 --> 00:04:41.848 line:95%,end
I think it's going to
be Payton and Maddie.

00:04:41.914 --> 00:04:43.816 line:95%,end
- Oh, maybe it will be Payton.
- I think Patton and Maddie.

00:04:43.883 --> 00:04:45.718 line:95%,end
We all want our kids to have solos.

00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:47.520 line:95%,end
Maddie hasn't had a solo in weeks,

00:04:47.587 --> 00:04:49.322 line:95%,end
Payton hasn't had a solo the entire time

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:51.658 line:95%,end
she's been on the team,
Kristie Ray threatened

00:04:51.724 --> 00:04:53.960 line:95%,end
to quit last week if Asia
didn't get a solo.

00:04:54.027 --> 00:04:55.595 line:95%,end
If Abby doesn't assign these solos

00:04:55.662 --> 00:04:57.997 line:95%,end
I really hope that Gia can
handle the wrath of the mother

00:04:58.064 --> 00:04:59.565 line:95%,end
of whoever doesn't get one.

00:04:59.632 --> 00:05:01.768 line:95%,end
I just want Asia to dance,
that's why I'm here.

00:05:01.834 --> 00:05:03.469 line:95%,end
I want her to dance,
that's why we're here.

00:05:03.536 --> 00:05:04.604 line:95%,end
That's what we all want.

00:05:04.671 --> 00:05:06.039 line:95%,end
I don't blame you Kristie, though.

00:05:06.105 --> 00:05:07.974 line:95%,end
If you're not getting what
you want you got to fly.

00:05:08.041 --> 00:05:11.110 line:95%,end
So wait, you're saying that she should
have a solo in the group every week?

00:05:11.177 --> 00:05:15.114 line:95%,end
She's done two weeks in a row, ma-zing
in of groups. She deserves a solo.

00:05:15.181 --> 00:05:17.750 line:95%,end
Asia hadn't trained with us all summer,

00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:19.052 line:95%,end
never came to camp--

00:05:19.118 --> 00:05:20.486 line:95%,end
So, you went with Candy Apple.

00:05:20.553 --> 00:05:23.890 line:5%,start
I think out of all the girls,
Asia is the last person

00:05:23.956 --> 00:05:25.558 line:5%,start
that should have a solo this week.

00:05:25.625 --> 00:05:27.860 line:95%,end
She's only had a million already,

00:05:27.927 --> 00:05:29.862 line:95%,end
and Asia's not here all the time.

00:05:29.929 --> 00:05:32.665 line:95%,end
Asia's going to work-- let
me get let me get this straight to you.

00:05:32.732 --> 00:05:36.069 line:95%,end
Asia's going to work, and take jobs,
and train whenever she can.

00:05:36.135 --> 00:05:37.303 line:95%,end
So if you have a problem with that--

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.272 line:95%,end
- I don't have a problem with that.
- Well, obviously you do.

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:41.474 line:95%,end
You just said, you weren't here,
so you have a problem with it.

00:05:41.541 --> 00:05:43.076 line:95%,end
If you're telling me that you--

00:05:43.142 --> 00:05:45.078 line:95%,end
Did you not hear me say--

00:05:45.144 --> 00:05:46.713 line:95%,end
I didn't hear you because you're--

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:49.415 line:95%,end
--I had a problem with
where she was on the pyramid.

00:05:49.482 --> 00:05:51.250 line:95%,end
I don't care where the [bleep] she works.

00:05:51.317 --> 00:05:53.486 line:95%,end
- Excuse me?
- Now did you hear me?

00:05:53.553 --> 00:05:55.088 line:95%,end
Whoa, oh, oh.

00:05:55.154 --> 00:05:56.456 line:95%,end
- Why did you say it?
- Look at.

00:05:56.522 --> 00:05:59.325 line:95%,end
- Jill dropped the F bomb.
- You're screwed in the head

00:05:59.392 --> 00:06:02.161 line:95%,end
No, you're a hot mess, because
now you're dropping F bombs.

00:06:02.228 --> 00:06:04.597 line:95%,end
Well, okay, I think you're a hot mess.

00:06:04.664 --> 00:06:06.666 line:95%,end
You only get mad when you're wrong.

00:06:06.733 --> 00:06:08.534 line:5%,start
Nope.

GIANNA: The group routine
this week is called "Just Be."

00:06:14.173 --> 00:06:16.442 line:5%,start
I'm going to keep it very
simple, very elegant.

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:18.277 line:95%,end
James is a very unique choreographer,

00:06:18.344 --> 00:06:20.246 line:95%,end
and I'm so excited that he
is helping me this week.

00:06:20.313 --> 00:06:22.615 line:95%,end
And hopefully Abby will be
appreciative, and not fire me

00:06:22.682 --> 00:06:24.016 line:95%,end
for doing our own choreography.

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:28.855 line:95%,end

- I'm calling Kelly.

00:06:32.158 --> 00:06:33.693 line:95%,end
- Why?
- Because.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.828 line:95%,end
[telephone ringing]
I don't know owe you an explanation.

00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:37.430 line:95%,end
No, you don't.
But I think it's rude.

00:06:37.497 --> 00:06:39.031 line:95%,end
- Kelly?
KELLY (ON PHONE): Hello?

00:06:39.098 --> 00:06:40.700 line:5%,start
- Hi.
CHRISTI: Hi, Kel.

00:06:40.767 --> 00:06:41.968 line:95%,end
KELLY (ON PHONE): Hi.

00:06:42.034 --> 00:06:45.872 line:95%,end
I'm just calling to let you
know that Abby is not here.

00:06:45.938 --> 00:06:48.775 line:95%,end
I don't know where she is but anyhow,


00:06:48.841 --> 00:06:50.243 line:95%,end
the girls are learning a group dance

00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:53.679 line:95%,end
and since you made your statement
that you're back on the team--

00:06:53.746 --> 00:06:56.282 line:95%,end
LESLIE (ON TV): Like Rosa Parks,
I'm not moving.

00:06:56.349 --> 00:06:58.384 line:95%,end
KELLY (ON TV): I'm either
sitting there, or I'll go home

00:06:59.152 --> 00:07:00.219 line:95%,end
LESLIE (ON TV): Bye.

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:03.055 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I don't know if you
have plans for your girls

00:07:03.122 --> 00:07:05.191 line:95%,end
to dance this week, but if you do

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:08.194 line:95%,end
or if you want them to learn the dance,
I would suggest that you--

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:09.862 line:95%,end
WOMAN: Come on down.
- --get here.

00:07:10.696 --> 00:07:12.598 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: All right.
I'll talk to you later.

00:07:12.665 --> 00:07:15.168 line:95%,end
Kelly can come back right
now because Abby's not here

00:07:15.234 --> 00:07:17.170 line:95%,end
so she's not facing that
big fight at the front door

00:07:17.236 --> 00:07:19.238 line:95%,end
and her girls can come and dance,

00:07:19.305 --> 00:07:21.808 line:95%,end
which is all Kelly really
wanted in the first place.

00:07:21.874 --> 00:07:23.776 line:95%,end
Christi, what makes you
think you have the right

00:07:23.843 --> 00:07:26.045 line:95%,end
to invite Kelly and the kids
back here, when Abby is just--

00:07:26.112 --> 00:07:27.547 line:95%,end
- I-- I didn't invite her.
- -- away for the moment?

00:07:27.613 --> 00:07:30.516 line:95%,end
I was telling her what was going
on as far as I'm concerned,

00:07:30.583 --> 00:07:32.251 line:95%,end
those kids were still on the pyramid,

00:07:32.318 --> 00:07:33.619 line:95%,end
they're still part of this team.

00:07:33.686 --> 00:07:35.221 line:95%,end
I'm giving her the information.

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:36.556 line:95%,end
What she does with it is up to her.

00:07:36.622 --> 00:07:38.558 line:95%,end
- But your name is not Abby.
CHRISTI: I didn't say it was.

00:07:38.624 --> 00:07:39.926 line:95%,end
She did not allow them back on the--

00:07:39.992 --> 00:07:40.993 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: [inaudible].

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.361 line:95%,end
--you're really crossing the line, here.

00:07:42.428 --> 00:07:44.030 line:95%,end
Does anybody think I'm crossing the line?

00:07:44.096 --> 00:07:46.232 line:95%,end
Uh, no, I don't, but Abby might.

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:48.734 line:95%,end
I don't think Kelly should come in here,
because I think Abby would freak.

00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:50.736 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I understand why Kristie thinks

00:07:50.803 --> 00:07:53.606 line:95%,end
now is a good time for Kelly to bring her
girls back onto the team.

00:07:53.673 --> 00:07:56.909 line:95%,end
I mean, she knows how upset Abby
would be if she brought back

00:07:56.976 --> 00:07:59.078 line:95%,end
her kids without permission.

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:00.947 line:95%,end
If Gia and James don't want them in there,

00:08:01.013 --> 00:08:03.015 line:95%,end
they're going to tell him to leave, so--

00:08:03.082 --> 00:08:04.116 line:95%,end
Gia knows better to--

00:08:04.183 --> 00:08:05.218 line:95%,end
I don't think Abby's
expecting it to happen, so--

00:08:05.284 --> 00:08:06.619 line:95%,end
--to do that.

00:08:06.686 --> 00:08:07.987 line:95%,end
--I'm sure she didn't cover this with Gia.

00:08:08.054 --> 00:08:09.322 line:95%,end
Gia's not going to know what to do.

00:08:09.388 --> 00:08:11.357 line:95%,end
[music playing]
- She might not even come.

00:08:11.424 --> 00:08:13.359 line:95%,end
- Right.
- We may be worrying about nothing.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.595 line:95%,end
KELLY: I always come back to this studio

00:08:15.661 --> 00:08:17.797 line:95%,end
because my girls miss their family.

00:08:17.864 --> 00:08:19.432 line:95%,end
These girls are like sisters.

00:08:19.532 --> 00:08:22.535 line:95%,end
They have been together since
they were three years old.

00:08:22.602 --> 00:08:26.339 line:5%,start
And as much as Abby doesn't like it,
we are part of this team.

00:08:26.405 --> 00:08:29.742 line:5%,start
I'm just really not looking forward
to talking to that woman.

00:08:29.809 --> 00:08:31.811 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:08:31.878 --> 00:08:33.145 line:95%,end
Excuse me.

00:08:33.212 --> 00:08:34.981 line:95%,end
My kids are here to learn the group dance.

00:08:35.047 --> 00:08:36.148 line:95%,end
GIANNA: Okay.

00:08:36.215 --> 00:08:38.751 line:95%,end
I'm already stressed out enough
with Abby not showing up,

00:08:38.818 --> 00:08:40.453 line:95%,end
and now Kelly walks in the door.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.222 line:95%,end
If I stop Kelly from entering, it'll
be a huge blow out with the moms,

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:45.258 line:95%,end
and I don't have time for that.

00:08:45.324 --> 00:08:46.592 line:95%,end
WOMAN: Ah!

00:08:46.659 --> 00:08:47.994 line:95%,end
Ah! [clapping]

00:08:48.628 --> 00:08:49.629 line:95%,end
GIRL: Boom!

00:08:50.897 --> 00:08:53.466 line:95%,end
KELLY: Well, hello.
WOMAN: [interposing voices]

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:54.867 line:95%,end
- Ah.
- New carpet.

00:08:54.934 --> 00:08:56.002 line:95%,end
Where you sitting?

00:08:56.068 --> 00:08:57.169 line:95%,end
WOMAN: - Doesn't smell
good, but I'm getting by--

00:08:57.236 --> 00:08:58.538 line:95%,end
What are you moving over for?
My seat's over here.

00:08:58.604 --> 00:08:59.639 line:95%,end
I'm not moving.

LESLIE: Payton has earned
her spot on this team.

00:09:02.408 --> 00:09:04.176 line:5%,start
Being on the elite competition team

00:09:04.243 --> 00:09:07.280 line:5%,start
is a great opportunity for any dancer,

00:09:07.346 --> 00:09:10.216 line:95%,end
and Kelly is not going to take
that away from my daughter.

00:09:10.283 --> 00:09:14.620 line:95%,end
I just want Payton to feel welcomed here,

00:09:14.687 --> 00:09:16.455 line:95%,end
and not feel awkward and uncomfortable.

00:09:16.522 --> 00:09:19.058 line:95%,end
And I have not done anything to make
Payton feel uncomfortable.

00:09:19.125 --> 00:09:20.693 line:95%,end
You just showing up makes
her feel uncomfortable.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.361 line:95%,end
- Well, that's not my problem.
- Do you blame her, though?

00:09:22.428 --> 00:09:23.462 line:95%,end
KELLY: No.

00:09:23.529 --> 00:09:25.231 line:95%,end
Every time you did show up,
she was kicked back off the team.

00:09:25.298 --> 00:09:26.933 line:95%,end
It's Abby's decision.

00:09:26.999 --> 00:09:28.501 line:95%,end
KELLY: I don't pick who
gets to be on the team.

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:30.136 line:95%,end
- But it's not going to change.
- So she should be upset with Abby--

00:09:30.202 --> 00:09:31.537 line:95%,end
LESLIE: It's not going to change--
- --not me.

00:09:31.604 --> 00:09:32.705 line:95%,end
LESLIE: --again, so you're
going to walk back in here.

00:09:32.772 --> 00:09:33.839 line:95%,end
But that's not my fault.

00:09:33.906 --> 00:09:36.309 line:95%,end
I think Leslie is just very desperate

00:09:36.375 --> 00:09:37.710 line:95%,end
to be part of this team.

00:09:37.777 --> 00:09:43.115 line:95%,end
But Abby continues to tell her, you're not
part of the team, you're filling in.

00:09:43.182 --> 00:09:45.284 line:95%,end
When Abby comes in yelling,
this is between you two.

00:09:46.018 --> 00:09:47.119 line:95%,end
She keeps saying it's my fault.

00:09:47.186 --> 00:09:48.354 line:95%,end
[laughs]

00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:50.189 line:95%,end
I think it's your fault.
I think you guys are starting

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:51.824 line:95%,end
trouble and it's unnecessary.

00:09:51.891 --> 00:09:54.660 line:95%,end
I told Abby I was coming back to the team,
at the competition.

00:09:54.727 --> 00:09:55.728 line:95%,end
LESLIE: But she's not here.

00:09:55.795 --> 00:09:56.996 line:95%,end
I don't care.

00:09:57.063 --> 00:09:58.297 line:95%,end
LESLIE: But If she is here--

00:09:58.364 --> 00:09:59.865 line:95%,end
KELLY: When she is here,
I will still be sitting here.

00:09:59.932 --> 00:10:01.701 line:95%,end
If she was here she would
probably have you removed.

00:10:02.568 --> 00:10:03.603 line:95%,end
She can try.

Guys, she's not coming.

I guess that answers my question.

00:10:23.689 --> 00:10:25.891 line:5%,start
I was just going to ask you, is she here?

00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:29.762 line:5%,start
Now, the first day of not having
Abby present was pretty good.

00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:31.430 line:95%,end
It's like having a substitute teacher,

00:10:31.497 --> 00:10:33.532 line:95%,end
you're really happy about that.

Day two, I'm not too sure.

She needs to come home,
she needs to do her job.

Moms, why don't you guys come in too

bit about this weekend.

I got a text from her

about this week's competition.

00:10:50.983 --> 00:10:53.786 line:5%,start
I guess whatever Abby is going through
this week she doesn't want to talk.

00:10:53.853 --> 00:10:55.855 line:95%,end
As you guys know, Abby's still not here.

00:10:55.921 --> 00:10:57.256 line:95%,end
I don't know if she's coming.

00:10:57.323 --> 00:10:58.991 line:95%,end
I don't know if she's coming back today.

00:10:59.058 --> 00:11:01.861 line:5%,start
I really don't think it's fair
what Abby's doing to Gianna.

00:11:01.927 --> 00:11:03.462 line:5%,start
She left her high and dry.

00:11:03.529 --> 00:11:06.365 line:5%,start
Gianna is just stepping in and making
sure that these kids are

00:11:06.432 --> 00:11:09.201 line:95%,end
getting what they need this week
because Abby doesn't care to do it.

I tried to call her, she hung up on me.

00:11:11.837 --> 00:11:14.907 line:95%,end
Did Abby give you any instructions
about this week, at all?

00:11:49.742 --> 00:11:52.044 line:95%,end
Those are all the
routines that Abby gave me.

00:11:52.111 --> 00:11:55.081 line:95%,end
Because there's only three numbers,
and we usually have four,

00:11:55.147 --> 00:11:57.850 line:95%,end
is there any way I could have a solo?

00:11:57.917 --> 00:12:00.252 line:95%,end
- Have you asked Abby?
- No.

00:12:00.319 --> 00:12:02.354 line:95%,end
Gianna announces that
there's only three dances,

00:12:02.421 --> 00:12:05.958 line:5%,start
and normally we take
four, and Abby's not here,

00:12:06.025 --> 00:12:09.895 line:95%,end
so I just feel like this is a perfect
opportunity for Brooke to ask for a solo.

00:12:09.962 --> 00:12:11.697 line:95%,end
We can maybe work something out,

00:12:11.764 --> 00:12:14.767 line:95%,end
but I can't do anything
without talking to her first.

00:12:14.834 --> 00:12:16.335 line:95%,end
You know what?

00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:19.538 line:95%,end
If Abby comes back and she takes it away
from her, I'm fine with that.

00:12:19.605 --> 00:12:21.140 line:95%,end
But at least Brooke tried.

00:12:21.207 --> 00:12:25.177 line:5%,start

00:12:28.514 --> 00:12:30.049 line:95%,end
GIANNA: Asia, your feet.

00:12:30.116 --> 00:12:31.383 line:95%,end
I want this to--

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:35.588 line:95%,end
You know, I can't really say I'm all that
sad Abby's not here.

00:12:35.654 --> 00:12:37.223 line:95%,end
Saying that you miss
Abby when she's not here

00:12:37.289 --> 00:12:40.159 line:95%,end
is like saying you miss a hemorrhoid.
Do you really?

00:12:40.226 --> 00:12:42.495 line:95%,end
- I'm sad for her mom--
- Very much.

00:12:42.561 --> 00:12:44.430 line:95%,end
--but But I'm disappointed
that Abby doesn't call us.

00:12:44.497 --> 00:12:45.531 line:95%,end
We don't know.

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:46.665 line:95%,end
Well, she did the same
thing with Broadway Baby.

00:12:46.732 --> 00:12:48.701 line:95%,end
I know, but did she
hang up on Gia, really?

00:12:48.768 --> 00:12:50.069 line:95%,end
- Yeah, she did.
- Well, she told us she did.

00:12:50.136 --> 00:12:51.637 line:95%,end
[interposing voices]
- Leslie was there with me.

00:12:51.704 --> 00:12:53.539 line:95%,end
I think she's always been there for Gia,

00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:55.708 line:95%,end
so she's really going through
a lot with her mother for her

00:12:55.775 --> 00:12:57.710 line:95%,end
not to even take Gia's phone calls.

00:12:57.777 --> 00:13:00.346 line:95%,end
All we want is a phone call.
Where are you?

00:13:00.446 --> 00:13:02.882 line:95%,end
Are you coming back? But nothing.
No word.

00:13:02.948 --> 00:13:04.517 line:95%,end
0 from Abby.

00:13:04.583 --> 00:13:06.519 line:95%,end
I was there when Abby was
on the phone with Gianna,

00:13:06.585 --> 00:13:08.587 line:95%,end
and just as easily as she could have said,

00:13:08.654 --> 00:13:11.490 line:95%,end
Hello, make sure you run the
group dance, I can't make it,

00:13:11.557 --> 00:13:13.092 line:95%,end
instead she hung up.

00:13:13.159 --> 00:13:15.561 line:95%,end
That's not professional
and it's not responsible.

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:17.029 line:95%,end
Give her a brief explanation.

00:13:17.096 --> 00:13:19.665 line:95%,end
Something's come up, I can't
make it, take care of the group

00:13:19.732 --> 00:13:21.333 line:95%,end
dance and the two solos.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.402 line:95%,end
- No, three solos.
- Three solos?

00:13:23.469 --> 00:13:24.737 line:95%,end
Oh.

00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:26.405 line:95%,end
- How about you?
- That's a surprise.

00:13:26.472 --> 00:13:27.573 line:95%,end
- How about you?
- That's right.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:28.707 line:95%,end
I would've been the same way--
[interposing voices]

00:13:28.774 --> 00:13:31.877 line:95%,end
Yeah. Kelly, can I just say, I would
take baby steps if I were you.

00:13:31.944 --> 00:13:33.512 line:95%,end
Yeah, I know.
You're pretty gutsy.

00:13:33.579 --> 00:13:35.447 line:95%,end
Any one of those kids
could've asked for a solo,

00:13:35.514 --> 00:13:36.916 line:95%,end
they just didn't raise their hand.

00:13:37.516 --> 00:13:39.084 line:95%,end
Okay, it has to look like that on stage,

00:13:39.151 --> 00:13:40.920 line:95%,end
please, please, please,
please, please, please.

00:13:40.986 --> 00:13:42.655 line:95%,end
This is the first time
we're going to a competition

00:13:42.721 --> 00:13:44.290 line:95%,end
without Abby, and it's a really big deal.

00:13:44.356 --> 00:13:46.258 line:95%,end
It's going to be tough,
but I think we can do it.

00:13:46.325 --> 00:13:48.093 line:5%,start

Is Abby with her mother?

00:13:55.601 --> 00:13:57.136 line:95%,end
I don't know.

00:13:57.203 --> 00:13:58.871 line:95%,end
Well, you are the only
one who speaks to her.

00:13:58.938 --> 00:14:00.172 line:95%,end
Why don't you find out?

00:14:00.239 --> 00:14:02.041 line:5%,start
Obviously, Abby is with her mother.

00:14:02.107 --> 00:14:03.175 line:95%,end
I'll call her.

00:14:03.242 --> 00:14:04.810 line:95%,end
LESLIE: It would probably be
better if Melissa called her.

00:14:04.877 --> 00:14:07.613 line:95%,end
Abby is probably in L.A.
scouting a new studio to get

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:09.081 line:95%,end
away from these crazy moms.

00:14:09.148 --> 00:14:10.950 line:95%,end
I'd like to be a fly on the wall

00:14:11.016 --> 00:14:14.019 line:95%,end
when she looks down and sees
your name on her caller ID.

00:14:14.086 --> 00:14:16.088 line:95%,end
I have a sneaky suspicion that Abby

00:14:16.155 --> 00:14:19.058 line:95%,end
is off with that creepy werewolf
guy that she has been seeing.

Hi, Abby it's Kelly.

00:14:25.598 --> 00:14:27.766 line:95%,end
I just wanted to let you
know that we had asked Gianna

00:14:27.833 --> 00:14:29.969 line:95%,end
if Brooke was able to do a solo,

00:14:30.035 --> 00:14:32.571 line:95%,end
and she said we had to get
approval from you first.

00:14:32.638 --> 00:14:34.673 line:95%,end
So if you could give Gianna a call

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:36.408 line:95%,end
and let her know if she's allowed or not,

00:14:36.475 --> 00:14:37.576 line:95%,end
I would appreciate it.

00:14:37.643 --> 00:14:39.011 line:95%,end
Thanks, bye.

You know what you guys, I am
not going to let her scare me.

She doesn't scare me.

00:14:47.119 --> 00:14:50.022 line:95%,end
I can handle whatever Abby wants
to do with me, I don't care.

GIANNA: Hey, girl.

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:52.324 line:95%,end
Ready?

00:14:52.391 --> 00:14:53.626 line:95%,end
When I talked to Abby last,
she was talking

00:14:53.692 --> 00:14:55.861 line:95%,end
about your emotions,
and she said every week

00:14:55.928 --> 00:14:57.696 line:95%,end
she sees the same face.

00:14:57.763 --> 00:15:00.699 line:95%,end
So she gave me this piece of
music that is so powerful,

00:15:00.766 --> 00:15:01.800 line:95%,end
we need to pull more out.

00:15:01.901 --> 00:15:03.102 line:95%,end
More emotion.

00:15:03.168 --> 00:15:04.637 line:95%,end
I need more connection
with the audience,

00:15:04.703 --> 00:15:06.672 line:95%,end
not the same old face. Okay?

00:15:07.773 --> 00:15:09.675 line:95%,end

lyrical or routine this week

I know that Abby says
she hasn't been connecting

00:15:14.613 --> 00:15:16.448 line:5%,start
with the audience recently,
so I'm making sure

00:15:16.515 --> 00:15:18.784 line:5%,start
that this is extra emotional,
that she can give something

00:15:18.851 --> 00:15:20.786 line:95%,end
more than just a typical Maddie solo.

00:15:20.853 --> 00:15:23.055 line:95%,end
More. Because--

00:15:23.122 --> 00:15:24.857 line:95%,end
Good.

00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:27.192 line:95%,end

are involved in the Starlight

come watch because she said

Awesome.

Maddie can dance for Hannah

inspiration for Maddie.

True. True.
I thought it was her mom.

00:17:35.888 --> 00:17:40.959 line:5%,start
I did talk to Abby last night,
and she didn't say much about

00:17:41.026 --> 00:17:42.761 line:95%,end
whether you're dancing,
whether you're not dancing.

00:17:42.828 --> 00:17:45.564 line:95%,end
So, let's have something prepared,

00:17:45.631 --> 00:17:47.966 line:95%,end
but if she really doesn't want you
to dance, then she'll scratch it.

00:17:48.033 --> 00:17:51.537 line:95%,end
I actually think it's great that Gia
is choreographing a solo for Brooke--

00:17:51.603 --> 00:17:53.672 line:95%,end
It's great that she picks
up and leaves this team

00:17:53.739 --> 00:17:56.175 line:95%,end
constantly, and it's great
that she walks back in here

00:17:56.241 --> 00:18:01.113 line:95%,end
when Abby does not want her back and her
daughter gets a solo. That's great.

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:03.849 line:95%,end
How does somebody that
gets thrown off the team,

00:18:03.916 --> 00:18:07.352 line:95%,end
leaves time and time again,
and walks back in here,

00:18:07.419 --> 00:18:10.355 line:95%,end
and is told that Gia will
lose her job if this child has

00:18:10.422 --> 00:18:13.992 line:95%,end
a solo, how does she still get a solo?
It's not fair.

00:18:14.059 --> 00:18:16.295 line:5%,start
This problem is between Abby and I,

00:18:16.361 --> 00:18:19.131 line:5%,start
and my kids have been here
since they were three years old,

00:18:19.198 --> 00:18:21.266 line:95%,end
so we're not going anywhere.

00:18:21.333 --> 00:18:22.768 line:95%,end
You're disappointed Brooke as a solo,

00:18:22.835 --> 00:18:24.269 line:95%,end
we're all happy Brooke--
- I'm disappointed--

00:18:24.336 --> 00:18:25.404 line:95%,end
- --has a solo.
- -- that--

00:18:25.471 --> 00:18:26.538 line:95%,end
So who is the bad guy, Leslie?

00:18:26.605 --> 00:18:28.540 line:95%,end
I'm disappointed that you can break rules,

00:18:28.607 --> 00:18:30.542 line:95%,end
you don't have to follow
anybody's authority

00:18:30.609 --> 00:18:33.412 line:95%,end
around here, and you still
get to come out on top.

00:18:33.479 --> 00:18:34.546 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Wait a minute.
- Because you know what?

00:18:34.613 --> 00:18:35.848 line:95%,end
The only person Breaking a rule this week

00:18:35.914 --> 00:18:37.883 line:95%,end
is Abby, because she's not here.

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:40.319 line:95%,end
I will not leave this team on my own.

00:18:40.385 --> 00:18:42.154 line:95%,end
The only way I'll leave this
team is if Abby kicks me off.

00:18:42.221 --> 00:18:46.091 line:95%,end
You're not running me out like
you done every other woman that

00:18:46.158 --> 00:18:50.329 line:95%,end
has sat up here with her child to try
to get the same opportunities as you have.

00:18:50.395 --> 00:18:51.763 line:5%,start
Leslie is trying to pretend that she

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:56.335 line:5%,start
is the victim, but any animosity
that the moms have towards her,

00:18:56.401 --> 00:18:58.270 line:5%,start
Leslie brought on herself.

00:18:58.337 --> 00:19:00.606 line:95%,end
I keep moving,

00:19:00.672 --> 00:19:02.774 line:5%,start
Going through the motions.

BROOKE: My solo this week
is a contemporary number.

00:19:07.012 --> 00:19:10.682 line:5%,start
And Abby and the moms
are constantly fighting,

00:19:10.749 --> 00:19:14.219 line:5%,start
so my song and my dance are about that.

00:19:14.286 --> 00:19:17.956 line:95%,end
Everybody's watching but
nobody knows who I am.

00:19:18.023 --> 00:19:19.591 line:95%,end
Just step up to the corner.

00:19:19.658 --> 00:19:21.360 line:95%,end
'Cause I--
- Finish the turn.

00:19:21.426 --> 00:19:22.961 line:95%,end
So, Kel, how do you feel about Brooke

00:19:23.028 --> 00:19:24.930 line:95%,end
doing a solo to her own song?

00:19:24.997 --> 00:19:26.798 line:95%,end
- I think it's amazing.
LESLIE: I don't know what she's--

00:19:26.865 --> 00:19:28.967 line:95%,end
- I'm excited.
- What is that song about?

00:19:29.034 --> 00:19:31.170 line:95%,end
I personally think it's a lot about Abby.

00:19:31.236 --> 00:19:34.706 line:95%,end
It talks about her hurting,
and how she keeps dancing

00:19:34.773 --> 00:19:36.074 line:95%,end
to get through it, and--

00:19:36.175 --> 00:19:37.209 line:95%,end
Yeah.

00:19:37.276 --> 00:19:38.744 line:95%,end
Obviously, emotional hurt, or physical?

00:19:38.844 --> 00:19:40.279 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Both.
- Well, both.

00:19:40.345 --> 00:19:42.047 line:95%,end
I'll just keep moving--

00:19:58.463 --> 00:20:01.633 line:95%,end
you didn't allow her
back from what I know of.

So could you please get back
to me as soon as possible?

Thank you.

Leslie, why are you
so upset about the solo?

00:20:06.705 --> 00:20:08.273 line:95%,end

KELLY: --if you're going to lose your job.

00:20:15.414 --> 00:20:16.815 line:95%,end
But you forget, you're the
one that asked for a solo--

KELLY: So did you.

00:20:17.983 --> 00:20:19.618 line:95%,end

to be on the team,

already part of the team,

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:33.298 line:95%,end

doesn't want to be on the team

if we're on the team.

00:20:34.533 --> 00:20:35.701 line:95%,end

team so she can be on the team.

- Oh, good.
- So I'm going to go get her.

Hannah, saying that she
really wanted to meet Maddie

It says, Yes I did call Gianna back,

Brooke should not do a solo,

Isn't your daughter, Brooke, doing a solo?

Yes.

But at the end, did you look at her?

00:30:34.499 --> 00:30:36.601 line:95%,end
Because it looked like when you
were finished, she was like,

00:30:36.668 --> 00:30:37.735 line:95%,end
she looked at me.

00:30:37.802 --> 00:30:39.103 line:95%,end
When you were finished and you smile?

Yeah.

straws, who got the shortest

Hello.

Okay.

00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:27.852 line:95%,end

When are you coming home to us?

You know Abby doesn't
mean what she's saying.

00:32:23.207 --> 00:32:24.542 line:95%,end
She loves you, Brooke.

00:32:24.609 --> 00:32:26.778 line:95%,end
She talks about you all the time.

00:32:26.844 --> 00:32:28.913 line:95%,end
Prove to her that you
deserve to be on this team.

No.

00:32:30.782 --> 00:32:33.584 line:95%,end
I would never make you do something
I didn't think you should do.

00:32:33.651 --> 00:32:36.187 line:95%,end
You know I would never
do something like that.

00:32:36.254 --> 00:32:38.556 line:95%,end
Brooke, you can do this.
I've watched you do your dance.

- Brooke, you know it.
- No.

00:32:43.728 --> 00:32:47.932 line:95%,end
You don't even need an
hour to learn the dance,

00:32:48.032 --> 00:32:49.634 line:95%,end
you just go on stage and you're beautiful.

00:32:49.701 --> 00:32:50.835 line:95%,end
You have almost two hours.

00:32:50.902 --> 00:32:52.136 line:95%,end
Just do it.

00:32:54.839 --> 00:32:57.108 line:5%,start
I'm not really sure about doing this dance

00:32:57.175 --> 00:33:00.411 line:5%,start
because Abby already hates us,
and she's probably

00:33:00.478 --> 00:33:03.948 line:95%,end
going to hate me more after
doing this dance, but yeah.

00:33:04.015 --> 00:33:05.950 line:95%,end

She had 15 minutes to learn this dance.

She was dancing to her own song.

And before she went on stage
she sat and listened to Abby

I can guarantee you that.

Ask me again after they dance.

Okay. That's fair.

00:38:21.832 --> 00:38:23.734 line:95%,end
and she gave it to Hannah.

00:38:23.801 --> 00:38:27.605 line:95%,end
And think that's really a sweet
thing because a big trophy's

00:38:27.672 --> 00:38:28.873 line:95%,end
kind of cool to have.

00:38:28.939 --> 00:38:31.142 line:95%,end
9 to 11, small groups.

00:38:31.208 --> 00:38:32.643 line:95%,end
Okay, here we go.

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:36.914 line:5%,start
Third place, "Teacher's Pet."

00:38:36.981 --> 00:38:38.015 line:95%,end
Okay.

00:38:38.082 --> 00:38:39.150 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:38:39.216 --> 00:38:43.654 line:95%,end
Second place, entry number 85, "Seasons."

00:38:44.755 --> 00:38:47.191 line:95%,end
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Gia!

00:38:47.258 --> 00:38:50.961 line:95%,end
Your highest scoring
9 to 11 small group will

00:38:51.028 --> 00:38:55.266 line:5%,start
be entry number 81, "Just Be."

00:38:55.333 --> 00:38:56.867 line:5%,start
[applause]

00:38:56.934 --> 00:38:58.035 line:5%,start
Ah!

00:38:58.102 --> 00:38:59.370 line:95%,end
[laughs] [cheering]

00:38:59.437 --> 00:39:00.838 line:95%,end
- Oh, my God.
- Yes.

00:39:00.905 --> 00:39:02.473 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:04.141 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:39:04.208 --> 00:39:06.344 line:95%,end
I couldn't be more thrilled right now.

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:09.213 line:95%,end
These kids just won this
group dance without Abby,

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.349 line:95%,end
and they beat really good dancers.

00:39:11.415 --> 00:39:13.984 line:95%,end
[screams]

00:39:15.619 --> 00:39:17.121 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:39:17.188 --> 00:39:18.389 line:95%,end
That was like winning the Olympics.

00:39:18.456 --> 00:39:20.524 line:95%,end
That is really-- it's a big deal.

00:39:20.591 --> 00:39:21.826 line:95%,end
[cheering]

00:39:21.892 --> 00:39:24.128 line:95%,end
I definitely think that
Abby will be back next week,

00:39:24.195 --> 00:39:26.430 line:95%,end
unless her mother takes
a turn for the worst.

00:39:26.497 --> 00:39:27.832 line:95%,end
Call her right now and tell her we won.

00:39:27.898 --> 00:39:29.266 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:39:29.333 --> 00:39:31.001 line:95%,end
Are you serious?
Do I really need to call her?

00:39:31.068 --> 00:39:32.970 line:95%,end
She probably doesn't
want to hear about our win.

00:39:33.037 --> 00:39:34.839 line:95%,end
[phone ringing]

00:39:37.541 --> 00:39:38.642 line:95%,end
I'm sorry?

00:39:42.012 --> 00:39:43.381 line:5%,start
Is Abby there?

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:47.651 line:5%,start
- [laughs]
- Okay.

00:39:47.718 --> 00:39:49.587 line:95%,end
Can you just tell her that the group won.

00:39:49.653 --> 00:39:50.988 line:5%,start
MANDY (ON PHONE): The group won.

00:39:51.055 --> 00:39:53.557 line:5%,start
And Maddie won, and Asia won.

00:39:53.624 --> 00:39:55.292 line:95%,end
How's Mrs. Miller feeling?

00:39:57.561 --> 00:39:59.296 line:95%,end
Okay. She's not the hospital, is she?

00:40:00.765 --> 00:40:01.766 line:95%,end
Okay.

00:40:01.832 --> 00:40:04.435 line:95%,end
I'm really not sure where Abby is.

00:40:04.502 --> 00:40:06.370 line:95%,end
Is she in Pittsburgh, is she in Florida?

00:40:06.437 --> 00:40:08.739 line:95%,end
She was with her mother, but
then when she called Gianna,

00:40:08.806 --> 00:40:09.940 line:95%,end
she wasn't with her mother at all.

00:40:10.007 --> 00:40:11.175 line:95%,end
That's all hearsay, though.

00:40:11.242 --> 00:40:12.777 line:95%,end
You don't know if any of that's true.

00:40:12.843 --> 00:40:14.512 line:95%,end
All right. Keep protecting her, Leslie.

00:40:14.578 --> 00:40:16.280 line:95%,end
All I'm saying is she
should have been here,

00:40:16.347 --> 00:40:19.083 line:95%,end
but if she was with her mother,
then that's understandable.

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:21.285 line:95%,end
She said she wasn't coming
back until I was gone.

00:40:21.352 --> 00:40:23.387 line:95%,end
She never mentioned a word about,

00:40:23.454 --> 00:40:26.090 line:95%,end
my mother is sick,
that's why I'm not here.

00:40:26.157 --> 00:40:27.758 line:95%,end
She's not here because I'm here.

00:40:27.825 --> 00:40:30.060 line:95%,end
She said nothing about her mother.

00:40:30.127 --> 00:40:32.296 line:95%,end
GIRLS: [screaming]

00:40:32.363 --> 00:40:34.131 line:95%,end
Woo!

00:40:34.198 --> 00:40:35.366 line:95%,end
WOMEN: [cheering]

00:40:38.702 --> 00:40:40.938 line:95%,end
Good job, honey.

00:40:41.005 --> 00:40:43.507 line:95%,end
HOLLY: That has to feel so good.

00:40:43.574 --> 00:40:47.645 line:95%,end
Can you believe Abby
was not here for one step.

00:40:47.711 --> 00:40:49.146 line:95%,end
How do you guys feel about that?

00:40:49.213 --> 00:40:52.783 line:95%,end
- I miss her.
- I do too.

00:40:58.055 --> 00:40:59.690 line:95%,end
Abby should have been here.

00:40:59.757 --> 00:41:01.225 line:95%,end
She would've been proud of
you guys, but she wasn't.

00:41:01.292 --> 00:41:03.027 line:95%,end
- Uh-huh.
- And it was her choice.

00:41:03.093 --> 00:41:04.995 line:5%,start
[music playing]

00:41:07.832 --> 00:41:09.633 line:5%,start
ABBY (VOICEOVER): Next, on "Dance Moms."

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:11.902 line:5%,start
Does anyone know if
Abby is going to be here?

00:41:11.969 --> 00:41:13.504 line:5%,start
My mother comes first.

00:41:13.571 --> 00:41:17.641 line:5%,start
I need the dancer that
can be Chloe this weekend.

00:41:17.708 --> 00:41:20.277 line:5%,start
Did Abby mention anything
about nationals, Melissa?

00:41:20.344 --> 00:41:21.612 line:5%,start
- Listen to me.
- I'm listening.

00:41:21.679 --> 00:41:22.780 line:5%,start
You're the God, I know.

00:41:22.847 --> 00:41:24.315 line:5%,start
You make a point to tell all of us.

00:41:24.381 --> 00:41:27.218 line:5%,start
Tiffany, I thought you
and I were a team, adios,

00:41:27.284 --> 00:41:29.420 line:5%,start
[inaudible] get out of here.

00:41:29.487 --> 00:41:30.888 line:5%,start
Gianna, where's Abby?

00:41:30.955 --> 00:41:33.290 line:5%,start
God. I hate this.

00:41:33.357 --> 00:41:35.493 line:5%,start
I hate It. I hate it.

00:41:35.559 --> 00:41:37.361 line:5%,start
[crying]
