ABBY (Voiceover):
Previously on "Dance Moms."

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:05.271 line:5%,start
Your replacements will
be at the competition.

00:00:05.338 --> 00:00:09.075 line:5%,start
Could you quit running up to the mirror,
so close? Think!

00:00:09.142 --> 00:00:11.244 line:5%,start
Mackenzie forgets her dance on stage.

00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:13.680 line:5%,start
She goes completely blank.
Listen to what I'm saying.

00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:16.216 line:5%,start
- I'm hearing you. And I know.
- ABBY: Nothing should get in their way.

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:19.586 line:5%,start
Same think about worrying
about a guy, instead of your own kids.

00:00:19.652 --> 00:00:21.321 line:5%,start
MELISSA: We have a happy household.

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:23.723 line:5%,start
Well, your kid doesn't look
very happy to me. You are more worried

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.559 line:5%,start
about your friendships with all of
these women than your own kids

00:00:26.626 --> 00:00:28.261 line:5%,start
and you know it, because you're an idiot!

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:29.696 line:5%,start
Yeah, go.

00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:31.331 line:5%,start
ABBY (Voiceover) Coming up on "Dance Moms"

00:00:31.498 --> 00:00:33.433 line:5%,start
Jill, she did a costume
behind Abby's back.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.337 line:5%,start
I don't like people going behind my back.
You know that's my problem with Melissa.

00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:38.772 line:5%,start
You're using hats.

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:43.143 line:5%,start
A hat is very specific to the style
of the routine.

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:45.412 line:5%,start
Put the hat on their head
and make sure it's right.

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:47.647 line:5%,start
Kendall, I don't think
you'll be doing your solo.

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:49.816 line:5%,start
It's all their fault!
Get your kid and leave.

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:51.451 line:5%,start
You're idiots if you stay.

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:54.354 line:5%,start
I knew something was up when
we hadn't seen Cathy in weeks.

00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:56.423 line:5%,start
I don't want to be fourth
in front of Cathy.

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:59.459 line:5%,start
The boys are just amazing.
[Christi] Come on, Chlo. We're done.

(SINGING) Get up.

00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:06.232 line:95%,end
Get on the floor.

00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:11.971 line:95%,end
My world is with my girls,
living on the dance floor.

MELISSA: I don't think I've ever been
so nervous to walk into pyramid

00:01:24.484 --> 00:01:25.518 line:95%,end
as I am right now.

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:28.188 line:5%,start
It's bad enough that we got fourth place
at competition last week

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:31.424 line:95%,end
but Abby and I got in a big fight.
And I know she's mad at me.

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:37.964 line:95%,end
I just want to look at
what fourth place looks like.

00:01:38.965 --> 00:01:40.100 line:95%,end
I really can't remember

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:43.903 line:5%,start
when the Abby Lee Dance Company
competition team came in fourth.

00:01:44.337 --> 00:01:47.140 line:95%,end
That had to be 20, 25 years ago.

00:01:47.207 --> 00:01:48.341 line:95%,end
It was devastating to me.

00:01:48.408 --> 00:01:52.812 line:95%,end
This weekend we will be traveling
to Voorhees, New Jersey.

00:01:53.413 --> 00:01:56.082 line:95%,end
We will be attending On Stage America.

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:57.851 line:95%,end
I don't want to be fourth, again.

00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:01.087 line:95%,end
On the bottom, Mackenzie.

00:02:01.154 --> 00:02:04.023 line:95%,end
You will not be performing in
the group routine this weekend.

00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:07.527 line:95%,end
Next, Maddie.

00:02:07.594 --> 00:02:10.130 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Maddie and Mackenzie
we're both at the bottom.

00:02:10.196 --> 00:02:11.464 line:95%,end
It was, you know, a little different.

00:02:11.531 --> 00:02:15.135 line:95%,end
It is what it is. I mean, I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:18.638 line:95%,end
ABBY: At Nationals you were
amazing, just as good as Chloe.

00:02:18.705 --> 00:02:19.873 line:95%,end
But Chloe won.

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:21.541 line:95%,end
And ever since then...

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.377 line:95%,end
KELLY: I think Melissa and Maddie need

00:02:24.444 --> 00:02:27.180 line:5%,start
to get used to taking a turn
at the bottom.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.448 line:5%,start
Because we've all been there.

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:33.686 line:95%,end
Paige, once again, it's
the same pattern, Kelly.

00:02:33.753 --> 00:02:35.555 line:95%,end
It's like she doesn't
have to work anymore.

00:02:35.622 --> 00:02:37.824 line:95%,end
Like, I went, I won.
Third was good enough for me.

00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:45.532 line:95%,end
Nia, you're doing fine. But is fine
going to make you a star?

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:52.038 line:95%,end
Kendall, you didn't pull
my eyes in a negative way.

00:02:52.205 --> 00:02:54.040 line:95%,end
You actually pulled
them in a positive way.

00:02:54.107 --> 00:02:58.978 line:95%,end
When I don't say your name and
I stop yelling at you, get worried.

00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:03.016 line:5%,start
JILL: I'm ecstatic because Kendall's never
been off the bottom row of the pyramid.

00:03:03.082 --> 00:03:06.452 line:95%,end
We're moving up. This is what
we're working towards. This is good.

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:11.024 line:95%,end
And, Chloe, I thought you looked great.
It was good.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.893 line:95%,end
Was that exactly what you're
supposed to do? No.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.363 line:95%,end
Go out there and do the
routine that you were taught

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.265 line:95%,end
the way I envision it.

00:03:19.332 --> 00:03:23.036 line:95%,end
Better yet, Chloe, do it
better than I can imagine it.

00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:24.837 line:95%,end
That's a dancer.

00:03:25.004 --> 00:03:26.306 line:95%,end
And, on top of the pyramid...

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.775 line:95%,end
I think the kids think
it's going to be Brooke.


00:03:28.841 --> 00:03:31.010 line:95%,end
Ha! Not a chance.

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:33.613 line:95%,end
is nobody.

00:03:35.315 --> 00:03:38.384 line:95%,end
Nobody in a group that got
fourth deserves that spot.

00:03:38.851 --> 00:03:40.520 line:95%,end
Brooke, I don't have you on the team.

00:03:40.587 --> 00:03:42.055 line:95%,end
KELLY: She's been here every week.

00:03:42.121 --> 00:03:44.057 line:95%,end
What is the purpose of
her coming every week

00:03:44.123 --> 00:03:45.491 line:95%,end
if you're not going
to put her on the pyramid?

00:03:46.025 --> 00:03:47.927 line:95%,end
Brooke, do you want to be here?

00:03:49.295 --> 00:03:52.966 line:95%,end
See, that to me is not a
response that I'm looking for.

00:03:53.032 --> 00:03:57.070 line:95%,end
KELLY: I've been playing by the rules
with Abby. I haven't been name calling.

00:03:57.136 --> 00:04:00.306 line:95%,end
I haven't been fighting with her and
Abby still won't put her on the pyramid.

00:04:00.373 --> 00:04:02.141 line:95%,end
It's like she's playing a game with me.

00:04:02.208 --> 00:04:05.578 line:95%,end
I really don't care because I think your
pyramid is a crock of [bleep] anyways.

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:09.249 line:95%,end
This weekend we are doing a group routine
called "Pink Lemonade."

00:04:09.315 --> 00:04:11.551 line:95%,end
Brooke, I plan for you
to be in the group routine.

00:04:12.285 --> 00:04:14.621 line:95%,end
Kendall, you have a solo.

00:04:15.054 --> 00:04:16.155 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:04:16.222 --> 00:04:19.859 line:95%,end
Your solo is entitled "Owe You Nothing."

00:04:20.526 --> 00:04:21.561 line:95%,end
Remember that.

00:04:21.628 --> 00:04:23.529 line:95%,end
I owe you nothing.

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:25.431 line:95%,end
You are very lucky.

00:04:25.498 --> 00:04:28.534 line:95%,end
Embrace this opportunity
and make the most of it.

00:04:29.502 --> 00:04:31.471 line:95%,end
Nia, you also have a solo.

00:04:31.537 --> 00:04:33.373 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:04:33.473 --> 00:04:36.609 line:95%,end
Your solo is entitled
"100 Years From Now."

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.613 line:95%,end
Is it going to take you 100 more
years to straighten those legs

00:04:40.713 --> 00:04:44.017 line:95%,end
and point those feet or
are you going to do it now?

00:04:44.484 --> 00:04:45.518 line:95%,end
And I have one more solo.

00:04:47.687 --> 00:04:49.889 line:95%,end
Chloe, do you think you can
do the dance that I teach you?

00:04:51.991 --> 00:04:54.794 line:95%,end
Have you talked to your mom
about stopping the advocacy

00:04:54.861 --> 00:04:55.995 line:95%,end
for all the other mothers?

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:58.698 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: It's obvious that
Abby is still holding a grudge

00:04:58.765 --> 00:05:00.333 line:5%,start
over our walk out a few weeks ago.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.502 line:95%,end
Well, we're here now, and
Chloe's ready to work.

00:05:02.568 --> 00:05:03.970 line:95%,end
And Abby just needs to move on.

00:05:04.537 --> 00:05:08.107 line:95%,end
Chloe, this is a contemporary routine,
as well.

00:05:08.174 --> 00:05:12.645 line:95%,end
There's lots of hits, accents, it's
stronger than you've been doing before.

00:05:12.712 --> 00:05:15.148 line:95%,end
And it is called "Left in the Dark."

00:05:15.682 --> 00:05:18.284 line:95%,end
The group routine is entitled
"Pink Lemonade."

00:05:18.685 --> 00:05:22.422 line:95%,end
You're using hats, and
the hats are a prop.

00:05:22.588 --> 00:05:25.591 line:95%,end
Drop your hat and you're off the team.

00:05:25.758 --> 00:05:28.161 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:31.030 line:95%,end
[laughter]
KELLY: God! Let's be a little harsh.

00:05:31.097 --> 00:05:32.498 line:95%,end
They think I'm joking?

00:05:32.565 --> 00:05:35.835 line:95%,end
Let somebody drop the
hat and see what happens.

00:05:35.902 --> 00:05:38.971 line:95%,end
Moms, you're dismissed.
You're going to be rhinestoning.

00:05:39.038 --> 00:05:42.442 line:95%,end
Ladies, spread apart. Start to warm up.
Grand pliÃ© in second.

(singing) The world...

00:05:48.715 --> 00:05:53.152 line:5%,start
The world was mine to give.

00:05:54.654 --> 00:05:57.156 line:95%,end
I must say, I'm surprised that Abby's up.

00:05:57.223 --> 00:05:59.292 line:95%,end
Abby must really care about this routine.

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:01.728 line:95%,end
She is actually up and out of her chair.

00:06:01.794 --> 00:06:04.530 line:95%,end
Straddle leap, cut under, two jumps.

00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:10.436 line:95%,end
Yes.

00:06:11.003 --> 00:06:13.539 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Melissa, did Abby apologize to you?

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:16.175 line:95%,end
No. Has she ever apologized to you?

00:06:16.342 --> 00:06:19.145 line:95%,end
JILL: Maddie and Mackenzie are both
at the bottom of the pyramid.

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:21.881 line:95%,end
And I know Melissa is about to explode.

00:06:22.548 --> 00:06:26.586 line:95%,end
Clearly Abby, at this point,
wants nothing to do with Melissa.

00:06:26.652 --> 00:06:29.455 line:95%,end
It surprised me that she
said all that stuff to you

00:06:29.555 --> 00:06:32.191 line:95%,end
and you did not say anything back to her.

00:06:33.025 --> 00:06:35.561 line:95%,end
You are more worried about
your friendships with all these women

00:06:35.628 --> 00:06:37.597 line:95%,end
than your own kids, and you know it.

00:06:37.663 --> 00:06:41.834 line:95%,end
Same thing about worrying about
a guy instead of your own kids! Yes!

00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:44.270 line:95%,end
Going from one husband to another

00:06:44.337 --> 00:06:46.973 line:95%,end
instead of just worrying
about your kids... please.

00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:48.741 line:95%,end
It is what it is.

00:06:48.808 --> 00:06:51.978 line:95%,end
If somebody said that stuff about me
I don't know how I couldn't say something.

00:06:52.044 --> 00:06:54.380 line:95%,end
That's-- that's-- it works for you,
I guess. You know?

00:06:54.447 --> 00:06:56.516 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: It's so funny to
me to see Melissa sit there

00:06:56.582 --> 00:06:58.618 line:95%,end
and be like, "Oh, I don't care
if Maddie doesn't have a solo."


00:06:58.684 --> 00:07:00.720 line:95%,end
She's like, "No, I don't even care."

00:07:00.787 --> 00:07:02.321 line:95%,end
Melissa's wearing glasses this week

00:07:02.388 --> 00:07:04.857 line:95%,end
because her contacts can't stand through
all those tears.

00:07:04.924 --> 00:07:08.628 line:95%,end
You sat there and did not say a word and
Maddie still didn't get a solo this week.

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:13.299 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I'm not saying
anything to her about it.

00:07:13.366 --> 00:07:15.902 line:95%,end
That's not anybody else's concern.

00:07:15.968 --> 00:07:18.237 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:07:22.809 --> 00:07:26.312 line:5%,start
CATHY: You are here because
I had a team last year.

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:31.951 line:5%,start
I was a little lenient with that team
and it bit me in the apples.

00:07:32.018 --> 00:07:36.456 line:5%,start
I haven't seen Abby since
last year's Nationals in LA.

00:07:36.522 --> 00:07:41.160 line:95%,end
Since that time, I've used all my
resources to get just that perfect team.

00:07:41.227 --> 00:07:43.596 line:95%,end
And I think I finally have it.

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:46.265 line:95%,end
It's all boys.

00:07:47.533 --> 00:07:48.668 line:95%,end
That's genius.

00:07:48.734 --> 00:07:52.405 line:95%,end
There's a dance teacher by
the name of Abby Lee Miller.

00:07:52.805 --> 00:07:53.806 line:5%,start
I need to win.

00:07:53.873 --> 00:07:55.641 line:5%,start
I need to beat her.

00:07:55.808 --> 00:07:57.109 line:5%,start
That's why you guys are here.

00:07:57.677 --> 00:08:00.813 line:95%,end
First we have Bryant.

00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:03.950 line:95%,end
I know you're going to have to
really focus on your technique,

00:08:04.016 --> 00:08:06.219 line:95%,end
but I think you have a
burning desire to get ahead.

00:08:06.385 --> 00:08:08.054 line:95%,end
- Yes?
- Yeah.

If you want to slide on your head right
past Abby Miller, you do that.

Gino, you've got excellent technique.

00:08:21.901 --> 00:08:24.737 line:95%,end
I know that you're going
to bring it to the board.

00:08:24.804 --> 00:08:27.240 line:95%,end
And at the top of the pyramid...

00:08:28.274 --> 00:08:33.513 line:95%,end
Zack, highly trained, excellent technique.

00:08:33.913 --> 00:08:37.617 line:95%,end
And I a certain teacher
by the name of Abby Miller

00:08:37.683 --> 00:08:41.521 line:95%,end
who invited you
to come dance with her team.

00:08:41.888 --> 00:08:44.190 line:95%,end
So here we have it. Yes?

00:08:44.257 --> 00:08:45.424 line:95%,end
My thoughts behind the pyramid...

00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:49.161 line:95%,end
it promotes individual as
opposed to a group effort.

00:08:49.228 --> 00:08:53.266 line:95%,end
You're right.
And team, individual, leader.

00:08:53.432 --> 00:08:55.034 line:95%,end
- Enough said.

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:56.569 line:95%,end
OK, guys, let's go.

00:08:56.636 --> 00:08:59.539 line:95%,end
Girls are a dime a dozen at competitions.

00:08:59.705 --> 00:09:02.642 line:95%,end
Boys make the judges
sit up and take notice

00:09:02.808 --> 00:09:06.612 line:95%,end
especially when the
boys are as technically

00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:09.782 line:95%,end
fabulous as the boys that I've found.

ABBY: The name of the song is
"Pink Lemonade", but it's about life.

You get lemons, you make lemonade.

00:09:20.593 --> 00:09:21.961 line:95%,end
OK, let's try that with the music.

CHRISTI: Maddie looks like
she's ready to lose her mind.

00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:28.501 line:95%,end
I don't know how much more of this Melissa
is going to be able to take.

00:09:28.668 --> 00:09:31.737 line:95%,end
Because Maddie doesn't have a solo,
Mackenzie's not even in the group dance.

00:09:31.837 --> 00:09:33.372 line:95%,end
She's over in the corner
like a little rat, like,

Blah, blah, blah, blah."

going to do about Abby?

You're not going to do anything, really?

00:09:52.458 --> 00:09:53.859 line:95%,end
I don't know what to do.

00:09:54.026 --> 00:09:56.495 line:95%,end
I mean, I-- you know, it's a
shame that my whole kid's life

00:09:56.662 --> 00:09:57.763 line:95%,end
is about Miss Abby.

00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:59.632 line:95%,end
And I don't want to hurt Abby's feelings.

00:09:59.765 --> 00:10:01.500 line:95%,end
I'm not one to confront people.

00:10:01.634 --> 00:10:04.537 line:95%,end
I'll always appreciate everything
that Abby has done for my children.

00:10:04.604 --> 00:10:08.374 line:95%,end
She has made my children into the dancers
that they've become.

00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:09.642 line:95%,end
I'm going to be honest with you.

00:10:09.742 --> 00:10:12.778 line:95%,end
I regret things and I you know, I...

00:10:12.945 --> 00:10:15.247 line:95%,end
- I do.
- Like being in the car?

00:10:15.314 --> 00:10:16.882 line:95%,end
Do you regret that? I do.

00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:19.418 line:95%,end
Abby could turn on
anyone at any given time.

00:10:19.885 --> 00:10:21.454 line:95%,end

Kendall, this is Jen.

- Boom.

JILL: I know that Abby says a
costume doesn't make a number,

00:10:45.611 --> 00:10:46.979 line:95%,end
but it helps.

00:10:47.079 --> 00:10:49.815 line:95%,end
And if I'm willing to pay
the money and spend the time

00:10:49.882 --> 00:10:52.918 line:95%,end
and hire a designer, Abby
won't be able to overlook her.

- Bye.
- Bye. Thanks.

number to "Pink Lemonade."

Chloe, you're flexing your
palms on the arch back.

The hands are clean.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.882 line:95%,end
Now the girls use hats.

00:11:22.948 --> 00:11:25.718 line:95%,end
And there's a little surprise
with the hats as the routine goes on.

00:11:25.785 --> 00:11:29.221 line:5%,start
They pull the hats off, the
hair comes tumbling all down

00:11:29.655 --> 00:11:33.092 line:95%,end

with the hat in their hand.

Get That hat! Get it! Get it! Get it!

Nobody was good.

I mean, if that kid drops their hat
on stage, it ruins the whole number.

00:11:43.035 --> 00:11:47.273 line:95%,end
This is turning, leaping, jumping.
Not one person can be off.

Because when that hat's
off, you're going to see it.

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:52.578 line:95%,end
Dancing with the hat is pretty hard.

screw up at the competition.

Take the arms down the body.

00:13:22.268 --> 00:13:24.236 line:95%,end
Push like there's a wall
on either side of you.

And, you know what?
No more second chances, Kendall.

Has anybody ever heard
of this girl, Jen Rocket?

00:13:31.377 --> 00:13:34.446 line:95%,end
I had her come over
because I don't have costumes

00:13:34.513 --> 00:13:38.784 line:95%,end
that haven't been worn with Abby
that aren't another studio's. So I...

00:13:38.851 --> 00:13:41.921 line:95%,end
Did Abby design it or
did she leave it up to you to design it?

00:13:42.388 --> 00:13:44.256 line:95%,end
No, Abby didn't design it.

00:13:44.423 --> 00:13:47.493 line:95%,end

Because I don't want you to get yelled
at for doing something behind her back.

- MELISSA: Yes?

00:13:53.699 --> 00:13:56.535 line:95%,end
Come on down to the costume shop.
I want to go over these rhinestones.

00:13:56.635 --> 00:13:57.736 line:95%,end
- JILL: Woo-hoo!
- Let's go.

00:13:57.803 --> 00:13:59.738 line:95%,end
Let's get it done so we can
get home early and pack.

00:13:59.905 --> 00:14:01.774 line:95%,end
Yeah, OK. That's never going to happen.

00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:03.709 line:95%,end
ABBY: The costumes were custom made.

00:14:03.776 --> 00:14:06.579 line:95%,end
They're ready for the girls.
All they need is rhinestones.

00:14:06.645 --> 00:14:10.816 line:95%,end
The fedora is to be worn like that.

00:14:10.883 --> 00:14:13.953 line:95%,end
So it sits, it's all in
my head and I'm pointing it

00:14:14.119 --> 00:14:15.421 line:95%,end
to the right and down.

00:14:15.487 --> 00:14:17.923 line:95%,end
I have a costume in my

Obviously, Chloe is going

All right, now Kendall, for that solo
I would have loved her to be in green.

00:14:24.663 --> 00:14:27.366 line:95%,end
Well, let me tell you,
and regarding the costume

00:14:27.433 --> 00:14:30.269 line:95%,end
I have gray bottoms and a gray top.

00:14:30.402 --> 00:14:33.439 line:95%,end
And it's going to have,
like, a lace overlay over it.

00:14:33.505 --> 00:14:34.807 line:95%,end
You know what, Abby?

00:14:34.874 --> 00:14:36.775 line:95%,end
I think you're going to
like what we came up.

00:14:36.842 --> 00:14:40.746 line:95%,end
Jill, you just have to understand,
I don't like people going behind my back.

00:14:40.946 --> 00:14:41.947 line:95%,end
I wouldn't go behind your back, Abby.

00:14:42.014 --> 00:14:44.250 line:95%,end
But you know that's my
problem with Melissa.

00:14:44.316 --> 00:14:48.153 line:95%,end
JILL: I see and feel the tension
between Abby and Melissa.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.589 line:95%,end
And I know that Abby is
used to Melissa doing

00:14:50.723 --> 00:14:52.725 line:95%,end
all these extra things for her.

00:14:52.791 --> 00:14:55.294 line:95%,end
But Abby is not asking her to do it.

00:14:55.461 --> 00:14:57.630 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I guess Jill is taking
the approach

00:14:57.696 --> 00:15:01.433 line:95%,end
that gifts didn't really get her too far
so now she's into doing favors for Abby.

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:02.902 line:95%,end
MELISSA: That's something I would do.

00:15:03.335 --> 00:15:05.170 line:95%,end
Is there anything else in
here you need me to do for you?

00:15:05.237 --> 00:15:07.106 line:95%,end
- Nope.
- You don't need any help in here?

00:15:07.172 --> 00:15:08.841 line:95%,end
No. We're all good. All right.

00:15:11.277 --> 00:15:13.379 line:95%,end
- CHRISTI: Did you start your solo?
- No?

00:15:14.113 --> 00:15:15.147 line:5%,start
Whatever.

00:15:16.649 --> 00:15:17.883 line:5%,start
I don't, either.

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:21.387 line:5%,start
Nia, I told you before, the name of
your routine is "100 Years From Now."

00:15:21.453 --> 00:15:24.657 line:95%,end
You don't have 100 years from now
to fix your feet and your legs

00:15:24.723 --> 00:15:27.559 line:95%,end
I'm giving Nia a solo.
You might think I'm off my rocker.

00:15:27.726 --> 00:15:29.762 line:95%,end
This kid keeps telling me
she's working on her legs

00:15:29.862 --> 00:15:31.830 line:95%,end
and working on her feet
and working on her turnout.

00:15:31.897 --> 00:15:34.166 line:95%,end
I want to see her do a lyrical solo.

00:15:34.233 --> 00:15:36.802 line:95%,end
This is a lyrical routine
in the 11-12 age group.

Step it up!

00:15:38.404 --> 00:15:41.040 line:95%,end
- You all right?
- No. I'm not.

00:15:41.206 --> 00:15:43.509 line:95%,end
- What's wrong?
- My daughter hasn't started her solo.

00:15:43.609 --> 00:15:44.877 line:95%,end
Nobody seems to care.

00:15:45.044 --> 00:15:47.379 line:95%,end
Christi, maybe this is Abby's test

00:15:47.446 --> 00:15:49.715 line:95%,end
when she talks about
advocating for your child.

00:15:49.882 --> 00:15:51.917 line:95%,end
Holly can't possibly
understand how I'm feeling.

00:15:51.984 --> 00:15:54.620 line:95%,end
Nia's solo is finished, and
Chloe hasn't even started hers.

00:15:54.687 --> 00:15:57.022 line:95%,end
Why does Nia need all
that more time than Chloe?

00:15:57.089 --> 00:15:58.991 line:95%,end
Maybe you just need to go
down there and just talk to Ab.

00:15:59.058 --> 00:16:01.493 line:95%,end
OK, no. I don't know if you've met Abby.

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:04.330 line:95%,end
She doesn't have conversations.
She argues.

00:16:04.396 --> 00:16:05.998 line:95%,end
I wasn't trying to suggest
that you should fight with her.

00:16:06.065 --> 00:16:07.533 line:95%,end
- OK, thanks.
- OK.

00:16:07.599 --> 00:16:09.234 line:95%,end
You know have to get snippy with me, miss.

00:16:09.401 --> 00:16:12.237 line:95%,end
I feel like Christi's overreacting
more and more these days.

00:16:12.304 --> 00:16:14.006 line:5%,start
She's constantly throwing tantrums

00:16:14.139 --> 00:16:15.941 line:5%,start
and I'm not in the mood to fuss over her.

00:16:16.241 --> 00:16:17.609 line:95%,end
Yes, Hello?

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:20.746 line:95%,end
Yes. This is Abby Lee from the
Abby Lee Dance Company

00:16:20.913 --> 00:16:22.047 line:95%,end
in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

00:16:22.181 --> 00:16:24.516 line:95%,end
We're attending your event
in Voorhees, New Jersey.

00:16:24.683 --> 00:16:27.386 line:95%,end
I had to call the competition to verify

00:16:27.453 --> 00:16:29.722 line:95%,end
that our routines were entered
in the correct categories.

00:16:30.055 --> 00:16:32.992 line:95%,end
And I asked if anybody was
coming from another state.

00:16:33.058 --> 00:16:34.860 line:95%,end
I talked to On Stage America.

00:16:34.927 --> 00:16:36.261 line:95%,end
She wouldn't give me names

00:16:36.762 --> 00:16:39.865 line:95%,end
but there was one student from
Pennsylvania, which is us

00:16:40.299 --> 00:16:43.602 line:95%,end
and one studio from Ohio.

00:16:43.669 --> 00:16:47.206 line:95%,end
That's not just any studio from Ohio.
That's got to be Cathy.

00:16:47.706 --> 00:16:51.243 line:95%,end
She's going to come back with a vengeance.
I didn't like being fourth last week.

00:16:51.777 --> 00:16:54.079 line:95%,end
I don't want to be
fourth in front of Cathy.

00:16:54.246 --> 00:16:58.384 line:95%,end
The girls have to have straight legs.
Their arms need to be placed correctly.

00:16:58.450 --> 00:16:59.718 line:95%,end
They have to nail those turns.

00:16:59.785 --> 00:17:01.920 line:95%,end
If they don't win I get
to say, "I told you so."

00:17:09.495 --> 00:17:13.032 line:5%,start
And, a one, two, one, two, three.

00:17:13.098 --> 00:17:16.668 line:5%,start
And a one, two, and one, two, three.

00:17:17.236 --> 00:17:18.437 line:95%,end
I like this. This is cool.

00:17:18.504 --> 00:17:19.805 line:95%,end
- But I like this.
- Boom.

00:17:19.872 --> 00:17:20.939 line:95%,end
That, right there.

00:17:21.006 --> 00:17:24.109 line:95%,end
As I'm watching Chloe dance, she's really
done on this creepy doll thing well.

00:17:24.176 --> 00:17:28.213 line:5%,start
And, more importantly, she's remembering
every bit of her choreography

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:29.648 line:95%,end
with so little time to practice.

00:17:29.882 --> 00:17:32.451 line:95%,end
Feel that? Slow down. Do it again.

00:17:32.518 --> 00:17:34.253 line:95%,end
- And...
- MELISSA: This is pretty.

00:17:34.319 --> 00:17:37.222 line:95%,end
- Excuse me. Chloe's costume is beautiful.
MELISSA: Yes, it is.

00:17:37.289 --> 00:17:39.058 line:95%,end
- JILL: Beautiful. You did great job.
- CHRISTI: I'm not done.

00:17:39.591 --> 00:17:40.759 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Jill, what are you doing?

00:17:40.826 --> 00:17:42.194 line:95%,end
Are you not using the
costume that lady made?

00:17:42.261 --> 00:17:43.962 line:95%,end
Yeah. She wants green in
it, so I'm going to try

00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:46.031 line:95%,end
to get some green pieces to put in it.

00:17:46.098 --> 00:17:49.668 line:95%,end
- Did you show her the picture of it?
- No.

00:17:49.902 --> 00:17:52.805 line:5%,start
KELLY: Abby asked everyone
to have their costumes done for today.

00:17:52.905 --> 00:17:56.708 line:5%,start
Like, I can't believe
Jill doesn't have hers.

00:17:56.775 --> 00:17:58.143 line:95%,end
Jill, I'm confused.

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:01.513 line:95%,end
You don't have a costume for Kendall,
but I thought you had one made.

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:03.749 line:95%,end
I don't have it. That was yesterday.

00:18:03.816 --> 00:18:06.852 line:95%,end
- Oh, well, what are you working on now?
- Oh. This is pieces for the costume.

00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:08.687 line:95%,end
- CHRISTI: Okay.
- JILL: I don't have it in my possession.

00:18:08.754 --> 00:18:10.255 line:95%,end
And then you're just going
to add those pieces...

00:18:10.355 --> 00:18:11.824 line:95%,end
- And then I was going to add this.
- Oh, OK.

00:18:11.957 --> 00:18:13.592 line:95%,end
I was just a little confused.

00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:15.761 line:95%,end
Jill's been here long enough
that you would think

00:18:15.828 --> 00:18:19.098 line:95%,end
she would be smart enough to know
you just don't do stuff like that.

00:18:24.136 --> 00:18:26.839 line:5%,start
They're so holding back
because of their hats.

00:18:26.905 --> 00:18:28.607 line:95%,end
I was thinking the same thing.

00:18:28.707 --> 00:18:30.976 line:95%,end
They can't go all-out
because they've got to hold their heads

00:18:31.043 --> 00:18:32.644 line:95%,end
a certain way so the hats don't fall off.

00:18:32.711 --> 00:18:34.246 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Mm-hmm.
Chloe was saying that before, last night.

00:18:34.313 --> 00:18:36.248 line:95%,end
So they're dancing kind of stiff, I think.

00:18:36.315 --> 00:18:37.316 line:95%,end
Slow down, there.

00:18:37.382 --> 00:18:40.452 line:95%,end
Brooke, you're never straightening out
your first leg in that jump, at all.

00:18:40.519 --> 00:18:42.721 line:95%,end
Make sure your hat's on your head.

00:18:42.888 --> 00:18:45.190 line:5%,start
We all learned, at the very
first competition

00:18:45.257 --> 00:18:47.693 line:5%,start
that we ever went to with this
particular team

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:50.395 line:95%,end
that the headpiece stays on your head.

00:18:50.462 --> 00:18:52.898 line:95%,end
Who did we learn it from? Chloe.

00:18:52.998 --> 00:18:54.333 line:95%,end
I'm totally serious.

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:56.502 line:95%,end
I mean, if that kid
drops their hat onstage

00:18:56.668 --> 00:18:57.803 line:95%,end
it ruins the whole number.

00:18:57.903 --> 00:19:00.439 line:95%,end
All the judges are going
to look at somebody's hat.

00:19:01.073 --> 00:19:02.541 line:95%,end
All right, ladies! [gasps]

00:19:02.641 --> 00:19:03.675 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Scared me.

00:19:03.742 --> 00:19:05.477 line:95%,end
I've had it with the hat situation.

00:19:06.245 --> 00:19:10.749 line:95%,end
I don't have 48 more hours to
tell each kid 100 more times

00:19:10.816 --> 00:19:11.884 line:95%,end
how to wear their hat.

00:19:12.317 --> 00:19:16.221 line:95%,end
A hat is very specific to
the style of the routine.

00:19:16.755 --> 00:19:18.957 line:95%,end
Put the hat on their head
and make sure it's right.

00:19:19.458 --> 00:19:22.094 line:5%,start
JILL: That's not the way
to approach a situation.

00:19:22.161 --> 00:19:26.632 line:5%,start
I think the kids get the point.
But, come on, situations happen.

00:19:26.698 --> 00:19:30.569 line:95%,end
A hat may drop on the floor. Big deal.

Now this is a defining
moment in Kendall's life.

Right foot, rolling over.

00:19:42.447 --> 00:19:45.184 line:95%,end
She's either going to go
out there and wow the judges

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:50.155 line:95%,end
and impress me or she's going
to go out there and blow it.

JILL: Even though Abby's been
really, really hard on Kendall

00:19:53.926 --> 00:19:57.296 line:95%,end
and it has not been an easy
road, I'm really proud of her.

00:19:57.362 --> 00:19:59.198 line:95%,end
She's working towards something
and she's seeing results.

00:19:59.298 --> 00:20:02.134 line:95%,end
This is this is really good.

ABBY: Kendall, you're marking things.

00:20:04.136 --> 00:20:05.504 line:95%,end
Why are you marking things?

00:20:05.671 --> 00:20:06.905 line:95%,end
I didn't give Maddie a solo.

00:20:07.306 --> 00:20:10.976 line:95%,end
If I did, she wouldn't be marking it.
She would do it full out every time.

00:20:11.043 --> 00:20:14.880 line:95%,end
I think sometimes Abby forgets
that Kendall is only nine years old.

00:20:15.013 --> 00:20:17.916 line:95%,end
I am so happy that Kendall
has a solo this week.

00:20:17.983 --> 00:20:20.085 line:95%,end
ABBY: Your face is
ridiculous on the turns.

00:20:20.252 --> 00:20:23.355 line:95%,end

like to introduce you

to your choreographer for this week.
And this is Nick Anthony.

00:20:38.103 --> 00:20:42.274 line:5%,start
He's come all the way from
LA to work with you guys.

00:20:42.341 --> 00:20:45.677 line:5%,start
Nick is very good with hip hop.


00:20:45.811 --> 00:20:48.247 line:95%,end
It's going to go one, two.

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:53.118 line:95%,end
It's going to go punch, punch.
One, two, three and four, step.

00:20:53.185 --> 00:20:56.555 line:95%,end
He's utilizing the
contemporary boys and the hip

00:20:56.722 --> 00:20:59.358 line:95%,end
hop boys, and gelling it all together.

00:20:59.424 --> 00:21:00.993 line:95%,end
And that's what I was looking for.

00:21:01.126 --> 00:21:02.327 line:95%,end
Let's go one more time from the top.

00:21:02.394 --> 00:21:06.698 line:95%,end
CATHY: The dance that we're doing
at the competition is very masculine.

00:21:07.332 --> 00:21:08.634 line:95%,end
And it's called "Own It."

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:11.837 line:95%,end
And I thought that that was
very appropriate because I would

00:21:11.903 --> 00:21:15.240 line:95%,end
very much like to be able
to say that we owned it.

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:19.077 line:95%,end
Punch, punch, pull, cross, slice.

00:21:19.144 --> 00:21:21.546 line:95%,end
And four, five and six.

00:21:21.713 --> 00:21:23.482 line:95%,end
Okay. We're still struggling with that.

00:21:23.815 --> 00:21:25.384 line:95%,end
NICK: Not bad. We're under the gun.

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:28.220 line:95%,end
This competition hit us really fast.

00:21:28.387 --> 00:21:30.889 line:95%,end
These boys coming in from
all over the nation...

00:21:31.056 --> 00:21:32.691 line:95%,end
they're going to have to pull it together.

00:21:32.791 --> 00:21:33.792 line:95%,end
They don't have options.

00:21:34.459 --> 00:21:39.097 line:95%,end
Five, six, seven and one, two,
three and four. Step it back.

00:21:39.331 --> 00:21:43.835 line:95%,end
Step it back. One, two, three and
four, five and six.

00:21:43.902 --> 00:21:45.404 line:95%,end
- That's better.
- Much better.

Don't get so close to her!
Look at the gap behind you!

Sloppy feet, Kendall!

Your right ankle wasn't
pressed into the ground!

This rehearsal is not going
well, especially for Kendall.

00:22:17.402 --> 00:22:21.139 line:95%,end
To be honest, I don't think this kid
can handle everything on her plate.

Your left foot's sickled
on the jazz backbend!

Not to mention, she didn't
bring the costume for her solo.

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:31.049 line:95%,end
I guess this is it.
I'm going to dismiss you.

Kendall, I don't think
you'll be doing your solo.

00:22:36.388 --> 00:22:38.890 line:95%,end
Your mother was to have
that costume here today.

00:22:38.957 --> 00:22:40.492 line:95%,end
She knows everything, fine.

00:22:40.826 --> 00:22:44.629 line:95%,end
- I don't think you're doing a solo.
- Then I'm going home.

I have other children and
other responsibilities.

00:22:47.999 --> 00:22:51.570 line:95%,end
So I haven't had time to
get Kendall's costume, yet.

00:22:52.671 --> 00:22:56.308 line:95%,end
Abby better not take it out on Kendall.
It's not her fault.

00:22:57.075 --> 00:23:00.045 line:95%,end
I can have a costume!
They told me they have it!

00:23:00.112 --> 00:23:03.815 line:95%,end
You're idiots if you stay
and let this woman destroy your children.

00:23:03.982 --> 00:23:06.585 line:95%,end
You know that. This is destruction.

KELLY: I said the same thing last season.

00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:12.023 line:95%,end
Well, why don't we all
walk out until she apologizes

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:15.560 line:95%,end
to these children for treating
them like [bleep] animals?

00:23:16.395 --> 00:23:19.331 line:95%,end
I'm not doing it, guys. I'm not doing it.

00:23:20.699 --> 00:23:22.901 line:95%,end
Let's go.

00:23:22.968 --> 00:23:26.738 line:95%,end
It's not my fault. But even
more so, it's not her fault.

00:23:27.205 --> 00:23:29.508 line:95%,end
ABBY: No. But why didn't you just take
what I was offering you?

00:23:29.875 --> 00:23:30.876 line:95%,end
You're a grown adult woman.

00:23:31.009 --> 00:23:32.177 line:95%,end
- That's right.
- Just go get it.

00:23:32.244 --> 00:23:33.645 line:95%,end
And this is-- no.

00:23:33.812 --> 00:23:37.249 line:95%,end
I am a grown adult woman and--
and we are done with this. Come on.

00:23:39.885 --> 00:23:42.053 line:5%,start
Jill was to bring a
costume and she didn't.

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:43.622 line:5%,start
What did you expect Abby to do?

00:23:43.688 --> 00:23:44.890 line:95%,end
I'm so sorry, honey.

00:23:45.056 --> 00:23:46.057 line:95%,end
[crying]

00:23:46.158 --> 00:23:48.360 line:95%,end
I know. It'll never, ever work.

00:23:48.527 --> 00:23:51.363 line:95%,end
It'll never work. Okay?

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:52.831 line:95%,end
[crying]

00:23:53.265 --> 00:23:57.536 line:95%,end
It's okay. I'm trying so hard.

00:24:00.338 --> 00:24:03.074 line:95%,end
Girls, I'll be on the bus.

00:24:03.308 --> 00:24:08.013 line:95%,end
I just find it humorous that the moms
sat in the parking lot for two days

00:24:08.079 --> 00:24:10.081 line:95%,end
because Brooke and Paige weren't here.

00:24:10.148 --> 00:24:13.051 line:95%,end
But now that Kendall's not
here, it's "Screw you, honey."

00:24:13.185 --> 00:24:14.886 line:95%,end
Every man for themselves.

00:24:15.053 --> 00:24:17.122 line:95%,end
Look at Brooke and Paige.
They didn't shed a tear.


00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:26.932 line:5%,start
[music playing]

00:24:27.098 --> 00:24:28.467 line:5%,start
I need to know what you want to do.

00:24:29.634 --> 00:24:31.937 line:5%,start
- You OK, Kendall?
- It's not good.

00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:38.043 line:5%,start
I mean... I can't believe not one mom
was on my side, especially Kelly.

00:24:38.109 --> 00:24:40.111 line:95%,end
I mean, I quit the team for her.

00:24:40.178 --> 00:24:41.680 line:95%,end
Well, I can tell you right now

00:24:42.547 --> 00:24:44.950 line:95%,end
Melissa will never stick up to Abby again.

00:24:45.617 --> 00:24:48.553 line:5%,start
We all quit just a few weeks
ago, and where did it get us?

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:50.188 line:5%,start
Abby had us replaced in days.

00:24:50.255 --> 00:24:52.190 line:5%,start
And then we came back and
Abby was still horrible.

00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:55.327 line:95%,end
I think Jill's crazy if she wants
to go through this, again.

00:24:55.427 --> 00:24:57.429 line:95%,end
I'm going to go on the
bus and talk to Abby.

00:24:59.531 --> 00:25:01.633 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:25:04.769 --> 00:25:07.239 line:95%,end
- Yes?
- JILL: I want Kendall to dance.

00:25:07.472 --> 00:25:09.574 line:95%,end
You know I fought to get her on this team.

00:25:09.641 --> 00:25:12.410 line:95%,end
What did I say? When I forget your name...

00:25:12.477 --> 00:25:14.880 line:95%,end
- I know. I know. And I...
- ABBY: that's when you start to worry.

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:18.350 line:95%,end
Maybe tell Kendall, honey,
every time she corrects you,

00:25:18.517 --> 00:25:20.819 line:95%,end
that's like mommy spent $100.

00:25:20.986 --> 00:25:25.991 line:95%,end
So by the end of the day, you've
got $10,000, Maddie got $2,000,

00:25:26.157 --> 00:25:29.060 line:95%,end
Paige got zip. Spin it. You're the parent.

00:25:29.661 --> 00:25:31.930 line:5%,start
I know that Kendall wants to dance.

00:25:32.097 --> 00:25:35.834 line:5%,start
And Jill needs to realize that I'm never
going to coddle my dancers.

00:25:36.001 --> 00:25:37.636 line:95%,end
So, Jill, get over it.

00:25:37.702 --> 00:25:41.039 line:95%,end
If Kendall wants to dance,
she wants to go with us this weekend

00:25:41.172 --> 00:25:43.341 line:95%,end
get a costume and get on the bus.

00:25:43.508 --> 00:25:44.643 line:95%,end
Okay.

00:25:45.744 --> 00:25:48.146 line:95%,end

00:25:53.852 --> 00:25:54.886 line:95%,end
ABBY: Game faces.

00:25:57.856 --> 00:26:00.792 line:95%,end
There are tons of fans waiting
at the door to meet us

00:26:00.926 --> 00:26:02.727 line:95%,end
and I don't even have time for them.

00:26:02.794 --> 00:26:05.697 line:95%,end
Because I have one thing on
my mind, and that's Cathy.

00:26:05.864 --> 00:26:07.866 line:95%,end
I've warned you over and over. Come on.

00:26:07.966 --> 00:26:09.467 line:95%,end
Listen, Paige, pay attention.

00:26:10.001 --> 00:26:12.237 line:5%,start
MELISSA: I don't know why Cathy
gets under Abby's skin so bad.

00:26:12.304 --> 00:26:14.839 line:5%,start
Because Abby knows that
we're better than her

00:26:15.006 --> 00:26:17.909 line:95%,end
so she just needs to just
not let it bother her.

00:26:18.076 --> 00:26:19.611 line:95%,end
Oh, all right.

00:26:19.878 --> 00:26:21.580 line:95%,end
[laughs]

CATHY: Smells not like
something's burning.

00:26:26.551 --> 00:26:28.520 line:95%,end
Woo! It's us, because we are hot!

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:32.424 line:95%,end
[laughs] I'm so excited to see Abby

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:35.060 line:5%,start
and to see her face drop to her toes

00:26:35.226 --> 00:26:38.530 line:5%,start
when she sees me walking in
with my entourage of boys.

00:26:38.597 --> 00:26:40.665 line:95%,end
Okay. Start to unpack.

00:26:40.765 --> 00:26:43.668 line:95%,end
Get the shoes on that
you're going to dance in.

00:26:43.768 --> 00:26:47.973 line:95%,end
Hello! I made it a point to go right
to Cathy's dressing room.

00:26:48.039 --> 00:26:54.679 line:95%,end
And lo and behold, all boys.

00:26:55.046 --> 00:26:56.715 line:95%,end
- Really?
- Yes, really.

00:26:56.781 --> 00:26:58.383 line:95%,end
- Really?
- Really.

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:00.118 line:95%,end
Man, oh, man.

00:27:00.285 --> 00:27:02.253 line:95%,end
Cathy is a snake.

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:05.790 line:95%,end
She secretly created this all boys team.

00:27:05.857 --> 00:27:09.227 line:95%,end
She knows that's the only way she could
even come close to beating me.

00:27:09.294 --> 00:27:10.528 line:95%,end
All right, guys.

00:27:10.629 --> 00:27:13.898 line:95%,end
Well, I have some gifts for you,
some Abby Lee Dance Company t-shirts.

00:27:13.965 --> 00:27:15.967 line:95%,end
Because, you know, we are
the National Champions.

00:27:16.034 --> 00:27:18.603 line:95%,end
You know what you're going to do
with those shirts. Right?

00:27:19.304 --> 00:27:22.540 line:95%,end
- You can dust with them.
- What?

00:27:22.607 --> 00:27:25.744 line:95%,end
Cathy, now come on.
Don't be rude like that.

00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:28.079 line:95%,end
- You that's it's unbecoming.
- Oh, my goodness.

00:27:28.146 --> 00:27:31.016 line:95%,end
The saddest part is,
Cathy's a great teacher.

00:27:31.082 --> 00:27:33.718 line:95%,end
She has great girls.
She just doesn't know how to teach guys.

00:27:33.785 --> 00:27:36.154 line:95%,end
Abby, do you have a boy dancing today?

00:27:36.221 --> 00:27:37.555 line:95%,end
- I don't.
- Oh.

00:27:37.622 --> 00:27:39.758 line:95%,end
- But, I'll...
- Well, I think that speaks volumes.

00:27:39.824 --> 00:27:41.960 line:95%,end
But I have lots of boys
working professionally.

00:27:43.995 --> 00:27:45.797 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:27:49.467 --> 00:27:52.771 line:95%,end
I knew something was up when
we hadn't seen Cathy in weeks.

00:27:52.937 --> 00:27:54.272 line:95%,end
And now I know what her game is.

00:27:54.439 --> 00:27:56.007 line:95%,end
She has an all boys team.

00:27:56.107 --> 00:27:59.878 line:95%,end
That's her MO because you guys
all know that a judge

00:27:59.944 --> 00:28:02.380 line:95%,end
they go for the boys all the time because
they want to keep them dancing.

00:28:02.447 --> 00:28:04.082 line:95%,end
You girls are a dime a dozen.

00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:06.685 line:5%,start
Abby is so obsessed now
with Cathy and her boys

00:28:06.751 --> 00:28:08.887 line:95%,end
that she's going to be
even harder on our girls.

00:28:09.187 --> 00:28:10.989 line:95%,end
I want that faster. Get three in there.

00:28:11.056 --> 00:28:14.225 line:95%,end
Make that mean something, Chloe.
That's the last time they see your face.

00:28:14.325 --> 00:28:15.827 line:95%,end
You got to stretch that front knee.
It's bent.

00:28:15.894 --> 00:28:18.229 line:95%,end
Where are you spotting that turn?
Don't lose steam.

00:28:18.296 --> 00:28:19.864 line:95%,end
[screams] Start over.

00:28:19.931 --> 00:28:23.868 line:95%,end
It's really important that
every single person on my team

00:28:23.935 --> 00:28:26.004 line:95%,end
goes out there and nails it.

00:28:26.071 --> 00:28:28.773 line:95%,end
We need every point we
can get to beat Cathy.

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:30.175 line:95%,end
Let's go.

[music playing]

00:28:35.647 --> 00:28:38.016 line:95%,end
Guys, whatever we get, be happy.

00:28:38.083 --> 00:28:39.617 line:95%,end
- Okay.
- And don't be mad at anybody.

00:28:40.185 --> 00:28:41.886 line:95%,end
I won't. OK.

All I have is words.

I wasn't doing so bad.

Now I'm the same as now.

But your hands show
you got nothing for me.

I can't believe it. She strutted her stuff
right on out there.

00:30:26.457 --> 00:30:29.761 line:5%,start
She captured the judges.
She had them in the palm of her hand.

You know, their eyes never left Kendall.

00:30:33.131 --> 00:30:34.833 line:95%,end
I think it was a good performance,

00:30:34.899 --> 00:30:37.669 line:95%,end

At night I'll take this whole town down

good enough for a win

Well, well, well.

The thing that takes the work, the sweat

00:33:26.337 --> 00:33:28.606 line:95%,end
when is the last time
that you went into a class

00:33:28.673 --> 00:33:31.843 line:95%,end
and actually were dripping with sweat?

00:33:31.909 --> 00:33:35.980 line:95%,end
When is the last time your feet
were so blistery on the bottom

00:33:36.047 --> 00:33:37.315 line:95%,end
that they were cracked open and bleeding?

00:33:37.382 --> 00:33:38.950 line:95%,end
When was the last time that happened?

00:33:39.017 --> 00:33:40.618 line:95%,end
That's a dancer.

00:33:40.685 --> 00:33:43.554 line:95%,end
This group routine has to be perfect.

00:33:43.621 --> 00:33:45.823 line:95%,end
Nobody better drop a hat.

00:33:45.923 --> 00:33:50.261 line:95%,end
We need every point we can get
if we have a chance to beat Cathy.

00:33:50.328 --> 00:33:53.765 line:95%,end
And you all know how I
get when Cathy shows up.

00:33:54.699 --> 00:33:56.467 line:95%,end
That was an embarrassment.

Nobody placed in the solos except Kendall,
and she was only third.

These girls better do
the group dance perfect.

00:34:11.749 --> 00:34:13.618 line:95%,end
Think about Cathy beating us.

00:34:13.684 --> 00:34:16.654 line:95%,end
Think about your reputation
as the National Champions.

00:34:16.721 --> 00:34:19.791 line:95%,end
We can't lose to Cathy not now, not ever.

00:34:19.857 --> 00:34:24.829 line:95%,end
You got picked to do a job
to beat a bunch of girls who come out

00:34:24.896 --> 00:34:26.264 line:95%,end
and do a whole lot of nothing.

00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:30.635 line:95%,end
Don't embarrass yourself. More importantly
do not embarrass me out there.

00:34:30.701 --> 00:34:31.769 line:95%,end
Come on, let's go.

00:34:31.836 --> 00:34:33.104 line:5%,start
I love "Pink Lemonade."

00:34:33.204 --> 00:34:35.273 line:5%,start
I think it's probably one
of my favorite group dances

I've ever seen the girls put together.

00:34:36.874 --> 00:34:39.877 line:95%,end
I think it really has a lot of potential

00:34:39.944 --> 00:34:42.747 line:95%,end
but I don't know if it has potential
to beat an all boys team.

One more shout out, then goodbye.

We gained sanity, split personality.

Own it.

From the outside, looking in,
grab the wheel and give a spin.

I didn't humiliate her!
