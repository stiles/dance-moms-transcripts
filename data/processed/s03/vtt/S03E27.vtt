00:00:02.635 --> 00:00:04.337 line:5%,start
JEFF: Coming up, juicy gossip.

00:00:04.404 --> 00:00:07.440 line:5%,start
There's a rumor that you
and the bus driver are doing it.

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:08.875 line:5%,start
JEFF: Some out of
control dance moms.

00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:11.745 line:5%,start
I think Holly, probably,
has the biggest butt.

00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:15.248 line:5%,start
We see each other a
lot, you know, naked.

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:17.050 line:5%,start
JEFF: And smack
-talking superfans.

00:00:17.117 --> 00:00:18.752 line:5%,start
I'm the boss,
and that's all there is to it.

00:00:18.818 --> 00:00:21.121 line:5%,start
Vivi is the mastermind
behind Cathy.

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:23.156 line:5%,start
JEFF: Plus, our very
own diva of dance.

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.491 line:5%,start
Who do you think dresses
the worst on the show?

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:26.192 line:5%,start
JEFF: Abby Lee Miller is here.

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:27.594 line:5%,start
Melissa needed to
be taught a lesson.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.729 line:5%,start
ALEC: You are unmovable.

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:31.698 line:5%,start
I went right to
the police station.

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:34.300 line:5%,start
This is "Dance Moms Chatter."

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:36.803 line:5%,start
[theme music]

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.173 line:95%,end
(SINGING) Get up,
get on the floor.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.445 line:95%,end
My world is with my girls,
living on the dance floor.

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:48.515 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:51.785 line:5%,start
Hi. I'm Jeff Collins.
And welcome to "Dance Moms
Chatter."

00:00:51.851 --> 00:00:53.920 line:5%,start
I'm here with everybody's
favorite dance teacher,

00:00:53.987 --> 00:00:56.756 line:5%,start
Miss Abby Lee Miller,
my favorite and yours.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.160 line:5%,start
Listen, if you love all things
"Dance Moms," grab a cocktail,

00:01:00.193 --> 00:01:02.195 line:95%,end
get comfy, because we're
going to dish the dirt

00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:04.464 line:95%,end
and reveal everything you've
always wanted to know

00:01:04.531 --> 00:01:06.433 line:95%,end
about your favorite
show and mine.

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:09.536 line:95%,end
We've got fan-favorite moments,
burning questions from Twitter,

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:12.005 line:95%,end
cast members, some
super-fan comedians,

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:13.807 line:95%,end
and never before seen clips.

00:01:13.873 --> 00:01:15.608 line:95%,end
Are you ready for the lowdown?

00:01:15.675 --> 00:01:17.677 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:01:19.846 --> 00:01:22.449 line:95%,end
All right. So listen, the
internet is buzzing about you
and the show,

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:25.085 line:95%,end
and we've got a lot of questions
from fans.

00:01:25.151 --> 00:01:27.587 line:95%,end
But actually, what I want to do
is take a moment to ask you

00:01:27.654 --> 00:01:28.922 line:95%,end
kind of how this
all got started.

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:32.392 line:95%,end
Why did you go straight to being
a choreographer versus being a
dancer?

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:36.062 line:95%,end
Well, I was very creative.
I had an eye for costuming.

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:37.897 line:95%,end
I had an eye for color.

00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:43.603 line:95%,end
I had a good ear to pick out
music that captured the
audience's attention.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.072 line:95%,end
A lot of people want to know
if you're one of those people

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:48.208 line:95%,end
who always dreamed of being
famous. Or is this--

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:50.043 line:95%,end
I was always a star
in my own mind.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.712 line:95%,end
It just took everybody else
a little time to catch up.

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:55.715 line:95%,end
I wanted my students
to be famous.

00:01:55.782 --> 00:02:00.320 line:95%,end
I wanted this life for them.
And now I'm living it. It's
crazy.

00:02:00.386 --> 00:02:02.388 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:07.427 line:95%,end
But I worked hard and I gave up
a lot for those kids, you know,

00:02:07.494 --> 00:02:11.631 line:95%,end
I gave up my personal life,
I gave up many, many, many, many
times

00:02:11.698 --> 00:02:15.168 line:95%,end
with my family doing things
because of my students.

00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:17.370 line:95%,end
You know, somebody
would have a wedding,

00:02:17.437 --> 00:02:20.106 line:95%,end
and I couldn't go because
my student was performing

00:02:20.173 --> 00:02:22.842 line:95%,end
at the Kennedy Center
in Washington D.C.

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:27.180 line:95%,end
You know, a Broadway opening
was the same time as my class
reunion.

00:02:27.247 --> 00:02:29.849 line:95%,end
You know, just I gave up
my personal life for these kids.

00:02:29.916 --> 00:02:32.385 line:95%,end
Right. Well, and now-- you know,
look what's happened to you now.

00:02:32.452 --> 00:02:34.754 line:95%,end
- You invested well in yourself.
- Thank you.

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:36.089 line:95%,end
JEFF: And in your kids.

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:38.158 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:40.760 line:95%,end
All right. Well, listen.
I've got a surprise for you.

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:44.764 line:95%,end
We have some guests on the show.
Not only are they super fans,
they are super funny.

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:48.301 line:95%,end
So please welcome "Ugly Betty's"
very own Alec Mapa

00:02:48.368 --> 00:02:51.638 line:95%,end
and recap queen, Nadine Rajabi.

00:02:51.704 --> 00:02:53.706 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:02:55.642 --> 00:02:57.410 line:95%,end
Hello.

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.149 line:5%,start
ALEC: Touch the money.
First rule of show business.

00:03:03.216 --> 00:03:05.885 line:5%,start
JEFF: Alec, how did you and
Nadine get to be such fans of
the show?

00:03:05.952 --> 00:03:09.022 line:5%,start
I actually heard about it after
the fact, after Season One.

00:03:09.088 --> 00:03:12.559 line:95%,end
And then I'm like,
oh, my God. What is this show?

00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:16.062 line:95%,end
And I went back. And I'm like,
oh, my God. Abby's amazing.

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:17.764 line:95%,end
- Thank you.
- You come on.

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.302 line:95%,end
And you just tell everybody
basically to [bleep] off, in a
good way.

00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:26.239 line:95%,end
ABBY: But anyway, she's cute,
and she's darling, and those
shoes are fabulous.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.609 line:95%,end
ALEC: You're like the Honey
Badger of the show.

00:03:29.676 --> 00:03:33.880 line:95%,end
Like, everybody could be going
crazy around you,

00:03:33.913 --> 00:03:35.915 line:95%,end
and you kind of, like, maintain
this demeanor

00:03:35.982 --> 00:03:37.850 line:95%,end
like, I'm the boss
and that's all there is to it.

00:03:37.917 --> 00:03:40.820 line:95%,end
And the best part is,
is that Abby goes, you know
what?

00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:43.156 line:95%,end
You're a suspended, daughter,
because your mom is a whore.

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:44.457 line:95%,end
Like, basically--

00:03:48.294 --> 00:03:51.998 line:95%,end
JEFF: What's been the worst
Dance Mom attack ever.

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:56.536 line:95%,end
Oh.
We refer to her as the sinister
minister.

00:03:56.603 --> 00:03:58.771 line:95%,end
JEFF: Let's take a look at
that infamous moment

00:03:58.838 --> 00:04:01.507 line:95%,end
and some more memorable
"Dance Moms" blowups.

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:05.478 line:95%,end
I don't care if you're taping.
I'm going in to--

00:04:05.545 --> 00:04:07.080 line:95%,end
ABBY: They were to
wear tights and a leotard.

00:04:07.146 --> 00:04:09.649 line:95%,end
I made two other children
change their clothes.

00:04:09.682 --> 00:04:12.085 line:95%,end
Because it's acro,
we're doing a lot on our knees.


00:04:12.151 --> 00:04:14.020 line:95%,end
And they have to be
in their bare feet.

00:04:16.456 --> 00:04:20.660 line:95%,end
- May I speak to you a minute?
- No. We're in rehearsal.

00:04:20.727 --> 00:04:23.630 line:95%,end
I want to speak to you.
You don't throw my kid out of
class.

00:04:23.696 --> 00:04:26.699 line:95%,end
- I paid for class.
ABBY: She's not dressed
appropriately.

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:30.870 line:95%,end
DAWN: I'm looking at every
single kid out here, Abby.

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:33.873 line:95%,end
They all look like children.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.210 line:95%,end
Isn't that crazy,
that children look like
children?

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:41.014 line:95%,end
- She's dressed appropriately.
ABBY: You're the minister.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.516 line:95%,end
look at.
The kids are not phased
whatsoever.

00:04:43.583 --> 00:04:45.852 line:95%,end
Let's play the Bible game, Abby?

00:04:45.885 --> 00:04:50.623 line:95%,end
When Jesus saw things that were
wrong, he went after it.

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.893 line:95%,end
And I'll tell you what.
You're not going to do this to
my kid.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.029 line:95%,end
Out of the room. Out, out.

00:04:56.095 --> 00:04:58.298 line:95%,end
Reagan, goodbye. Out, out.

00:04:58.364 --> 00:05:01.067 line:95%,end
DAWN: You're not throwing her
out. - Oh, yes I am, and you
with her.

00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:03.403 line:95%,end
- Go. Yes.
DAWN: No, you're not.

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:06.272 line:95%,end
Every week we put
the trash out. Go.

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:10.977 line:95%,end
Then take yourself out, because
you're the biggest piece of
trash there is.

00:05:11.544 --> 00:05:14.747 line:95%,end
- Abby, I think we need to talk.
ABBY: No. You're not gonna ruin
this day.

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:17.950 line:95%,end
No. We need to talk, Abby.
In the hallway now.

00:05:18.017 --> 00:05:20.820 line:95%,end
Are you kidding? I'm a paying
client, and you won't speak to
me.

00:05:20.887 --> 00:05:22.588 line:95%,end
No. Nothing's worth
that much money.

00:05:22.655 --> 00:05:25.358 line:95%,end
ABBY: I think the worst thing
that Christi can do

00:05:25.391 --> 00:05:29.262 line:95%,end
is talk about me
when her daughter is present.

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:34.033 line:95%,end
I can not get Chloe to trust me
if her mother doesn't trust me
herself.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.135 line:95%,end
I'm so excited for you,
because she got the best award.

00:05:36.202 --> 00:05:39.305 line:95%,end
We don't want to ruin
the way to victory.

00:05:39.372 --> 00:05:41.040 line:95%,end
- I'm not ruining today.
- No, Abby.

00:05:41.107 --> 00:05:42.442 line:95%,end
We need to go in the hallway.

00:05:42.508 --> 00:05:43.943 line:95%,end
Don't be doing this in
front of my daughter, Chris.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.180 line:95%,end
Abby. We can all go in the
hallway, because I tried to talk
to you,

00:05:47.246 --> 00:05:49.482 line:95%,end
and I tried to talk
to you personally.

00:05:49.549 --> 00:05:50.516 line:95%,end
- Let's go in the hallway.
- Why are you doing this?

00:05:50.583 --> 00:05:52.985 line:95%,end
- I'm not going anywhere.
- My daughter's happy.

00:05:53.052 --> 00:05:54.954 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Let's go in the
hallway. Do you want to talk
about

00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:56.923 line:95%,end
all the things that need to be
talked about?

00:05:56.989 --> 00:05:59.892 line:95%,end
- Not here, not now.
- Because you won't talk about
it.

00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:02.662 line:95%,end
- And you won't talk about it.
- I will never talk to you
again.

00:06:02.695 --> 00:06:05.465 line:95%,end
- Abby, I'm not talking--
- You're making my daughter cry.

00:06:05.531 --> 00:06:07.066 line:95%,end
- So shut up.
- Talk about what?

00:06:07.133 --> 00:06:10.069 line:95%,end
And how many times has my
daughter beat your daughter this
year?

00:06:10.903 --> 00:06:14.640 line:95%,end
We were stacked against
everybody this weekend because
you didn't.

00:06:14.707 --> 00:06:17.777 line:95%,end
- Get out of here now. Bitch.
- Let's go. Let's go.

00:06:17.844 --> 00:06:20.847 line:95%,end
Maybe your kids feel bad, but it
doesn't matter that my daughter
feels bad.

00:06:20.913 --> 00:06:24.851 line:95%,end
Your daughter is holding a
national title, and I will take
it away in a minute.

00:06:24.917 --> 00:06:27.720 line:95%,end
Girls. They are staying with me.

00:06:27.787 --> 00:06:31.324 line:95%,end
You are an uneducated mess.
Quit drinking.

00:06:32.992 --> 00:06:36.362 line:95%,end
I'm not going on the [bleep]
bus. That [bleep] bitch.

00:06:36.429 --> 00:06:38.464 line:95%,end
- Don't cry.
- I'm telling you.

00:06:38.498 --> 00:06:39.966 line:95%,end
Give me a phone.

00:06:40.032 --> 00:06:42.335 line:95%,end
You are out of control.

00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:46.072 line:95%,end
- I'm [bleep] for staying at
your studio. - There you go.

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:48.307 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Then I need to leave.
ABBY: You're done.

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:51.878 line:95%,end
You've had two weeks
to work on this routine.

00:06:51.944 --> 00:06:53.880 line:95%,end
KELLY: The haven't really worked
on it for two weeks, Abby. They
learned it--

00:06:53.946 --> 00:06:56.416 line:95%,end
I know. That's my point.

00:06:56.482 --> 00:06:59.018 line:95%,end
They don't self
motivate themselves.

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:01.354 line:95%,end
- They don't get out there and
work on it. - When do you want
them to work on it?

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:03.689 line:95%,end
We had privates,
but we weren't able to go to
them.

00:07:03.756 --> 00:07:06.392 line:95%,end
But Maddie went to hers.
You're so jealous of that kid.

00:07:06.459 --> 00:07:07.760 line:95%,end
- Oh, my God.
KELLY: I am not jealous of
Maddie.

00:07:07.827 --> 00:07:09.796 line:95%,end
You know, you're jealous
that I'm talking to her,

00:07:09.862 --> 00:07:11.364 line:95%,end
that I'm telling her the same
thing I tell her every week.

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:13.466 line:95%,end
Because, Abby,
we're going on a couple after
her.

00:07:13.533 --> 00:07:16.869 line:95%,end
You made sure her makeup was
perfect, her costume was
perfect.

00:07:16.903 --> 00:07:18.704 line:95%,end
You haven't looked
at these two at all.

00:07:18.771 --> 00:07:20.973 line:95%,end
Well, you handle her makeup.
She's your job.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.109 line:95%,end
- You know, I don't need a job.
- I know.

00:07:23.176 --> 00:07:25.044 line:95%,end
But your kid still needs
to point her feet.

- No money can buy that. No.
- That's your job.

00:07:27.213 --> 00:07:29.715 line:95%,end
- To teach them.
- Money can't buy talent.

00:07:32.552 --> 00:07:36.789 line:95%,end
Honey Badger don't care.
Like, you are unmovable.

00:07:36.856 --> 00:07:38.858 line:95%,end
Like, it was either her or you.

00:07:38.925 --> 00:07:41.027 line:95%,end
- And it was like, bye.
- My name's on the mortgage.

00:07:41.093 --> 00:07:42.895 line:95%,end
ALEC: I would have been like, in
the Bible,

00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:45.765 line:95%,end
Jesus wore the proper clothing
to the dance class.

00:07:46.532 --> 00:07:47.834 line:95%,end
It's in Leviticus.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:51.204 line:95%,end
But you could kind of see,
like, the crazy in her eyes
already,

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:54.640 line:95%,end
from the moment she walks into
the room. She's like Cookie
Monster.

00:07:54.674 --> 00:07:56.576 line:95%,end
Like, her eyes are,
like, [vocalizing]...

00:07:56.642 --> 00:07:57.677 line:95%,end
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.

00:07:57.743 --> 00:08:01.414 line:95%,end
ALEC: So there's no way that was
gonna end nicely for anybody.

00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:04.183 line:95%,end
JEFF: All right. So you had some
choice words for Sinister
Minister

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:05.551 line:95%,end
when she went off
on you that day.

00:08:05.618 --> 00:08:08.120 line:95%,end
So how did that situation
ultimately resolve itself?

00:08:08.187 --> 00:08:10.790 line:95%,end
ABBY: She got thrown
out, the police came,

00:08:10.857 --> 00:08:14.360 line:95%,end
hauled her out there, and said,
you're finished.

00:08:14.427 --> 00:08:17.663 line:95%,end
It's private property,
so I just dial 9-1-1,

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:19.832 line:95%,end
and they come and haul everybody
out of there.

00:08:19.899 --> 00:08:23.336 line:95%,end
Now it's up to me to sue her
for the rest of her tuition.


00:08:23.402 --> 00:08:26.506 line:95%,end
So she's not at the Abby Lee
Dance Company anymore? She
doesn't--

00:08:26.572 --> 00:08:28.140 line:95%,end
Hell no, Jeff.

00:08:28.975 --> 00:08:31.010 line:95%,end
JEFF: All right. So there's been
a lot of gossip on the blogs.

00:08:31.077 --> 00:08:32.812 line:95%,end
In case you haven't heard
or been paying attention,

00:08:32.845 --> 00:08:35.948 line:95%,end
Abby Lee Miller is officially
off the market.

00:08:36.015 --> 00:08:37.116 line:95%,end
[gasping]

00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:38.985 line:95%,end
- Take a look at this.
NADINE: Wow.

00:08:41.554 --> 00:08:43.389 line:95%,end
MAN: What is the question?
- Were you a jock in high
school?

00:08:43.456 --> 00:08:45.258 line:95%,end
Please tell me you
played football.

00:08:45.324 --> 00:08:47.360 line:95%,end
MAN: I played football,
I played basketball.

00:08:47.426 --> 00:08:49.729 line:95%,end
- I'm a 50-yard line backer.
- Oh, are you?

00:08:49.795 --> 00:08:52.331 line:95%,end
- I am.
- Cool. Were you a cheerleader?

00:08:52.398 --> 00:08:56.369 line:95%,end
No.
I just mean I did it on the 50
-yard line.

00:08:57.203 --> 00:08:59.539 line:95%,end
- You did?
- Let's just go over a few
things, Chris.

00:08:59.605 --> 00:09:02.074 line:95%,end
- I have some questions for you.
- I have some answers.

00:09:02.141 --> 00:09:04.944 line:95%,end
- Do you own your own tuxedo?
CHRIS: Yes, I do.

00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:06.913 line:95%,end
- Okay.
- As a matter of fact, I do.

00:09:06.979 --> 00:09:08.915 line:95%,end
And I can tie a bow tie,
an actual bow tie.

00:09:08.948 --> 00:09:10.683 line:95%,end
That's like a bonus point.

00:09:11.951 --> 00:09:13.653 line:95%,end
- Hi. How are you?
CARL: Good. How are you?

00:09:13.719 --> 00:09:15.488 line:95%,end
- Nice to meet you.
CARL: I'm Carl.

00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:18.558 line:95%,end
ABBY: Okay, ladies?
Carl has gum.

00:09:18.624 --> 00:09:22.094 line:95%,end
- But it must mean he has fresh
breath. - My mom used to teach
dance.

00:09:22.161 --> 00:09:23.596 line:95%,end
She used to own her
own dance studio.

00:09:23.663 --> 00:09:26.098 line:95%,end
So you grew up around
a dance studio.

00:09:27.133 --> 00:09:29.669 line:95%,end
- Oh, time's up. Time's up
- Saved by the bell.

00:09:29.735 --> 00:09:31.637 line:95%,end
I didn't even get
my tough questions.

00:09:32.872 --> 00:09:33.739 line:95%,end
Okay.

00:09:33.806 --> 00:09:36.576 line:95%,end
Why do they take me on their
field trips when I have the
worst outfits on?

00:09:36.642 --> 00:09:39.045 line:95%,end
You're only as good
as your last performance.

00:09:39.812 --> 00:09:41.380 line:95%,end
First of all-- wait,
wait, wait, wait.

00:09:41.447 --> 00:09:43.115 line:95%,end
First of all, we
have got to cover

00:09:43.182 --> 00:09:45.051 line:95%,end
what was the most shocking thing
you heard in that clip.

00:09:45.117 --> 00:09:48.854 line:95%,end
That Abby was a 50-yard line
girl. I'm just saying.

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:53.125 line:95%,end
JEFF: So let me ask you a
question, what made you decide
to go along

00:09:53.192 --> 00:09:54.894 line:95%,end
with this whole
speed-dating thing.

00:09:54.961 --> 00:09:57.396 line:95%,end
- I think I got to leave the
studio. - Did you enjoy it?

00:09:57.463 --> 00:09:58.631 line:95%,end
It was hilarious.

00:09:58.698 --> 00:10:01.400 line:95%,end
JEFF: Now, talking about on the
blogs about you dating someone.

00:10:01.467 --> 00:10:02.568 line:95%,end
So who are you dating now?

00:10:02.635 --> 00:10:05.972 line:95%,end
There's a rumor that you and
the bus driver are doing it. Is
that true?

00:10:06.038 --> 00:10:08.374 line:95%,end
ALEC: What blog did
you read that from?

00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:10.176 line:95%,end
- Jeff.
ALEC: Jeff.

00:10:10.242 --> 00:10:12.645 line:95%,end
I am not dating someone.

00:10:12.712 --> 00:10:15.448 line:95%,end
I just have someone
that cares about me.

00:10:15.514 --> 00:10:17.883 line:95%,end
Is it someone who cares about
you in Los Angeles?

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:19.018 line:95%,end
ABBY: Yes.

00:10:19.085 --> 00:10:21.153 line:95%,end
JEFF: So how weird is it
trying to date like that?

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:22.822 line:95%,end
When you go on a date like that,
and then cameras are following.

00:10:22.888 --> 00:10:25.424 line:95%,end
I know. That waiter was pretty
hot at that restaurant.

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:28.427 line:95%,end
For those of you who didn't see
that she actually went on a
date, here we go.

00:10:28.494 --> 00:10:29.729 line:95%,end
Let's take a look.

00:10:29.795 --> 00:10:32.865 line:95%,end
So you're not in a relationship
right now obviously.

00:10:32.932 --> 00:10:35.668 line:95%,end
Well, I kind of have
a long distance.

00:10:35.735 --> 00:10:38.004 line:95%,end
- We all have a long distance.
ABBY: Mhm.

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:40.673 line:95%,end
It's good to have
a long distance.

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:42.575 line:95%,end
It keeps it out there.

00:10:52.084 --> 00:10:53.753 line:95%,end
Oh, my God.

00:10:55.354 --> 00:10:56.255 line:95%,end
[gasps]

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:58.224 line:95%,end
This is the chef's specialty.

00:10:58.290 --> 00:10:59.825 line:95%,end
It's chocolate eruption.

00:10:59.892 --> 00:11:01.527 line:95%,end
He wasn't too bad.

00:11:02.228 --> 00:11:04.630 line:95%,end
- You can have the first bite.
- Mm.

00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:07.667 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:11:08.067 --> 00:11:09.435 line:95%,end
Is that good?

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:13.673 line:95%,end
- Tell me about your dance
background. - Yeah. Dance.

00:11:13.739 --> 00:11:16.208 line:95%,end
- I had a slight dance
background. - Tell me.

00:11:18.644 --> 00:11:21.113 line:95%,end
Yeah. Yeah. I was
a male stripper.

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.015 line:95%,end
ABBY: No, you weren't.
- Yeah. For a little bit.

00:11:24.116 --> 00:11:27.053 line:95%,end
- They made me do it.
- Who's they?

00:11:27.119 --> 00:11:29.221 line:95%,end
- No. I am not dancing on this
table. - Why?

00:11:29.288 --> 00:11:31.123 line:95%,end
- I'll break it.
- Wus.

00:11:31.791 --> 00:11:34.860 line:95%,end
I am 180 pounds of twisted steel
and sex appeal.

00:11:34.927 --> 00:11:36.929 line:95%,end
This table would crack.

00:11:36.996 --> 00:11:40.499 line:95%,end
- Twisted steel sex appeal.
- I'm just saying.

00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:42.201 line:95%,end
Oh hoo.

00:11:43.502 --> 00:11:44.670 line:95%,end
JEFF: What do you think, Alec?

00:11:44.737 --> 00:11:46.639 line:95%,end
I know we've just met,
but please tell me

00:11:46.706 --> 00:11:48.240 line:95%,end
you've never gone out
with this person again.

00:11:48.307 --> 00:11:49.208 line:95%,end
- No.
- Ever, ever.

00:11:49.275 --> 00:11:52.912 line:95%,end
Louie looked like a mix between
Count Chocula and "My Cousin
Vinny."

00:11:52.978 --> 00:11:54.747 line:95%,end
ALEC: With the kind of-- the
beard that kind of ends

00:11:54.814 --> 00:11:56.382 line:95%,end
like right underneath his eyes.

00:11:56.449 --> 00:11:58.451 line:95%,end
He took you to place
called Flowers in the Attic,

00:11:58.517 --> 00:12:00.319 line:95%,end
and you guys were the
only people there.

00:12:00.386 --> 00:12:03.689 line:95%,end
- Like, that's not creepy.
- He's my worst nightmare.

00:12:03.756 --> 00:12:05.958 line:95%,end
That date where you're, like,
laughing your head off,

00:12:06.025 --> 00:12:07.927 line:95%,end
and you're having a good time,
and he's looking at you

00:12:07.993 --> 00:12:10.096 line:95%,end
like you just
farted in his hand.

00:12:10.162 --> 00:12:12.264 line:95%,end
ABBY: No.
You know what I was thinking
about?

00:12:12.331 --> 00:12:13.566 line:95%,end
I was thinking of--

00:12:13.632 --> 00:12:15.501 line:95%,end
NADINE: "Teen Wolf."
ABBY: "Teen Wolf." Yes.

00:12:15.568 --> 00:12:18.204 line:95%,end
But then he had that weird
bleach streak going through.

00:12:18.237 --> 00:12:21.640 line:95%,end
He's, like,
I'm Count Vladimir of
Pittsburgh.

00:12:21.707 --> 00:12:24.410 line:95%,end
So what's more terrifying,
going on a first date with a
stranger

00:12:24.477 --> 00:12:27.246 line:95%,end
or being attacked
by a crazy dance mom?

00:12:27.313 --> 00:12:30.783 line:95%,end
Oh. Going on a first date with a
stranger. Definitely.

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:32.351 line:5%,start
The dance mom I can handle.


00:12:33.652 --> 00:12:35.721 line:5%,start
JEFF: I'm here with Abby Lee
Miller, the star of our show,

00:12:35.788 --> 00:12:39.658 line:5%,start
and superfan comedians,
Alec Mapa and Nadie Rajabi,

00:12:39.725 --> 00:12:42.595 line:5%,start
dishing the dirt
on "Dance Moms."

00:12:42.661 --> 00:12:44.964 line:95%,end
All right. Now we've seen what
happens when dance moms attack.

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:48.300 line:95%,end
But what happens about the rare
mom Abby calls friend?

00:12:48.367 --> 00:12:49.668 line:95%,end
- Well, sometimes.
- Sometimes.

00:12:49.735 --> 00:12:52.037 line:95%,end
Please welcome
dance mom Melissa.

00:12:52.104 --> 00:12:54.106 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:12:57.309 --> 00:12:58.511 line:5%,start
- Good to see you.
- Good. How are you?

00:12:58.577 --> 00:13:00.579 line:5%,start
JEFF: Melissa, you and Abby
have been friends for a long
time.

00:13:00.646 --> 00:13:02.281 line:95%,end
You guys have a long
history together.

00:13:02.348 --> 00:13:05.618 line:95%,end
So the fans want to know, like,
what's going on with the two of
you with this,

00:13:05.684 --> 00:13:07.219 line:95%,end
you know, on again,
off again relationship.

00:13:07.286 --> 00:13:09.588 line:95%,end
Because you had a little bit
of a rocky thing that happened.

00:13:09.655 --> 00:13:10.823 line:95%,end
MELISSA: We're always
going to be friends.

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:12.625 line:95%,end
JEFF: So this past season,
how did your friendship go?

00:13:12.691 --> 00:13:14.293 line:95%,end
You know, you were always
known as, like, best friends.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.562 line:95%,end
And then this last season, you
had a bit of a bump in the road.

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:18.998 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Oh. The standoff.
The standoff.

00:13:19.064 --> 00:13:24.570 line:95%,end
ABBY: Oh. Well, you know, I have
been telling Melissa, since day
one,

00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:27.173 line:95%,end
that she shouldn't do
what the other moms do.

00:13:27.239 --> 00:13:30.476 line:95%,end
If Maddie-- and I didn't
mean any offense by this--

00:13:30.543 --> 00:13:32.244 line:95%,end
was a racehorse,

00:13:32.311 --> 00:13:34.780 line:95%,end
she wouldn't be in the barn
with all the other horses.

00:13:35.581 --> 00:13:38.050 line:95%,end
She's winning the race.
She's a thoroughbred.

00:13:38.117 --> 00:13:39.752 line:95%,end
She is in the winner's circle.

00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:42.555 line:95%,end
The other horses that didn't
win, that aren't in the race--

00:13:42.621 --> 00:13:43.856 line:95%,end
Not so much.

00:13:43.923 --> 00:13:46.759 line:95%,end
ABBY: They're just getting the
oats or whatever, you know and
the apple.

00:13:46.826 --> 00:13:48.961 line:95%,end
And they're getting hosed off.
That's right.

00:13:49.028 --> 00:13:51.764 line:95%,end
So people say, oh,
she's your favorite.

00:13:51.831 --> 00:13:54.500 line:95%,end
She's on time. She's prepared.
She's warmed up.

00:13:54.567 --> 00:13:56.368 line:95%,end
She's dressed appropriately.

00:13:56.435 --> 00:13:57.736 line:95%,end
If you want to be the favorite,
do that too.

00:13:57.803 --> 00:13:59.872 line:95%,end
JEFF: What it really
boils down to-- and if I may--

00:13:59.939 --> 00:14:03.509 line:95%,end
you're upset because Melissa
sided with the moms and not you.

00:14:04.176 --> 00:14:05.010 line:95%,end
- Yes.
JEFF: All right.

00:14:05.077 --> 00:14:07.046 line:95%,end
So for anybody who missed it
or wants to see it again,

00:14:07.112 --> 00:14:09.081 line:95%,end
let's take a look at
what actually happened.

00:14:09.148 --> 00:14:10.583 line:95%,end
- You guys want to see it, Alec?
ALEC: Yes.

00:14:10.616 --> 00:14:11.784 line:95%,end
All right. Let's take a look
at what actually happened--

00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:14.854 line:95%,end
- Where's my popcorn?
- --And Abby.

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.255 line:95%,end
Here we go.

00:14:16.322 --> 00:14:18.624 line:95%,end
Ab, can I talk to you
for a sec before you leave?

00:14:18.691 --> 00:14:19.925 line:95%,end
ABBY: Yeah. What?

00:14:19.992 --> 00:14:25.130 line:95%,end
I really would love for Maddie
to prove to you that she can
win.

00:14:25.197 --> 00:14:27.299 line:95%,end
I know, Melissa,
but you have to realize that

00:14:27.366 --> 00:14:29.635 line:95%,end
she was just in a
duet with Kendall.

00:14:29.702 --> 00:14:32.705 line:95%,end
And even though she was a lot
better than Kendall and a lot
stronger,

00:14:32.771 --> 00:14:33.973 line:95%,end
she didn't blow me away either.

00:14:34.039 --> 00:14:36.075 line:95%,end
She is special.
And my daughter wants to dance.

00:14:36.141 --> 00:14:37.743 line:95%,end
But why am I telling you that?

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:41.647 line:95%,end
Why wouldn't a kid
that had the potential to make
it,

00:14:41.714 --> 00:14:43.349 line:95%,end
to have a career
in this business,

00:14:43.415 --> 00:14:47.586 line:95%,end
not have her own integrity,
her own ambition,

00:14:47.653 --> 00:14:48.988 line:95%,end
to get out of the
car and walk in?

00:14:49.021 --> 00:14:50.456 line:95%,end
MELISSA: She wanted to come.
- Then why didn't you--

00:14:50.522 --> 00:14:52.391 line:95%,end
What kind of parent were you
to not let her?

00:14:52.458 --> 00:14:54.059 line:95%,end
I've been committed
to the studio.

00:14:54.126 --> 00:14:57.062 line:95%,end
But your daughter has been given
opportunity after opportunity.

00:14:57.129 --> 00:15:00.799 line:95%,end
- And I realize that.
- I sent her to New York for
auditions.

00:15:00.866 --> 00:15:02.134 line:95%,end
- And she's gone every time.
ABBY: I took her to LA.

00:15:02.201 --> 00:15:04.703 line:95%,end
- I do all of these things,
Melissa. - And I know that.

00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:07.406 line:95%,end
ABBY: And I called you.
- I know you did.

00:15:07.473 --> 00:15:09.808 line:95%,end
ABBY: I called you.
I didn't call every one of those
mothers.

00:15:09.875 --> 00:15:13.913 line:95%,end
You risked--
Your kids special--

00:15:15.214 --> 00:15:16.248 line:95%,end
--on Paige and Brook.

00:15:16.315 --> 00:15:19.385 line:95%,end
I would have never picked up the
phone and called Sophia

00:15:19.451 --> 00:15:21.553 line:95%,end
if Maddie would've been
in this building working her
butt off.

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:23.122 line:95%,end
Well, you know, we
all make mistakes, Abby.

00:15:23.489 --> 00:15:26.959 line:95%,end
Yeah. But what you did,
you hurt your own kid. You
didn't hurt me.

00:15:26.992 --> 00:15:30.062 line:95%,end
- I realize that, Abby.
- No solo this weekend.

00:15:30.129 --> 00:15:33.999 line:95%,end
There is no way, Melissa.
You did this to Maddie. Not me.

00:15:34.767 --> 00:15:37.269 line:95%,end
JEFF: So Abby, did you feel like
you could trust Melissa after
what happened?

00:15:37.336 --> 00:15:40.105 line:95%,end
ABBY: I just think that Melissa
needed to be taught a lesson.

00:15:40.172 --> 00:15:43.709 line:95%,end
Her friendships have to be
separate from raising her
children.

00:15:43.776 --> 00:15:45.611 line:95%,end
Those kids should come first.

00:15:45.678 --> 00:15:49.081 line:95%,end
And there's other
talented kids out there.

00:15:49.148 --> 00:15:53.585 line:95%,end
Forget about this confrontation.
What the hell was Jill wearing
again?

00:15:53.652 --> 00:15:55.854 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I know.
She tries to be 20.


00:15:55.921 --> 00:15:57.990 line:95%,end
NADINE: She was wearing
a black poodle around her neck.

00:15:58.057 --> 00:16:01.927 line:95%,end
ABBY: Jill has two teenage
daughters, and I think she wants
to be them.

00:16:01.994 --> 00:16:03.996 line:95%,end
ALEC: Can I borrow this sweater,
you guys?

00:16:04.029 --> 00:16:06.732 line:95%,end
It's 14 sizes too small,
and too short, and--

00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:08.834 line:95%,end
JEFF: Well, there's
one dance mom, Cathy.

00:16:08.901 --> 00:16:11.603 line:95%,end
Cathy not only left the studio,
but she's been on a seemingly

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:14.740 line:95%,end
relentless campaign
to beat Abby at every turn.

00:16:14.807 --> 00:16:16.675 line:95%,end
- Take a look at this.
- Really?

00:16:18.711 --> 00:16:21.880 line:95%,end
There's a dance teacher in our
area whose kid--

00:16:23.882 --> 00:16:27.019 line:95%,end
went to New York city with him
while he was away from us.

00:16:29.121 --> 00:16:31.123 line:95%,end
- Stretch it out. Stretch it
out. JOHN: Hey, Abby.

00:16:32.291 --> 00:16:34.126 line:95%,end
JOHN: How are you?
- I'm good.

00:16:36.228 --> 00:16:38.430 line:95%,end
Good to see you.

00:16:38.497 --> 00:16:40.432 line:95%,end
ABBY: I'm so glad you're here.

00:16:40.499 --> 00:16:43.369 line:95%,end
ABBY: John is a brilliant,
brilliant choreographer.

00:16:43.402 --> 00:16:46.939 line:95%,end
- John, is that your LA man?
- No. That's my Miami John.

00:16:47.006 --> 00:16:49.341 line:95%,end
- That's your Miami John.
- She has Johns in every state.

00:16:51.543 --> 00:16:54.279 line:95%,end
Love you. Okay,
let's go. Come on.

00:16:55.681 --> 00:16:59.284 line:95%,end
Ooh. Cathy did not like that,
that you knew somebody.

00:16:59.351 --> 00:17:00.552 line:95%,end
Like, there's, like, daggers
coming out of her eyes.

00:17:00.619 --> 00:17:01.520 line:95%,end
I know everybody.

00:17:01.587 --> 00:17:03.322 line:95%,end
ALEC: You know everybody,
so you're the real deal.

00:17:03.389 --> 00:17:05.324 line:95%,end
ABBY: I've been doing
this for 33 years.

00:17:05.391 --> 00:17:07.259 line:95%,end
I take kids all
over the country.

00:17:07.326 --> 00:17:10.162 line:95%,end
She's at home
with her husband and her kid.

00:17:10.229 --> 00:17:14.700 line:95%,end
I leave my family,
I leave my studio, my hometown.

00:17:14.767 --> 00:17:17.603 line:95%,end
Every other studio in my town is
at home. Where am I?

00:17:17.669 --> 00:17:21.240 line:95%,end
Orlando, New York, Vegas, LA.
I'm with my students.

00:17:21.273 --> 00:17:24.209 line:95%,end
I meet people. I
network. I take my kids.

00:17:24.276 --> 00:17:27.212 line:95%,end
I walk in, I go... I throw them
at the producer, at the
director,

00:17:27.279 --> 00:17:28.380 line:95%,end
at the choreographers.

00:17:28.447 --> 00:17:29.948 line:95%,end
Here's the difference
between you and Cathy.

00:17:30.015 --> 00:17:32.317 line:95%,end
You tell it like it is.
She reminds me of that joke.

00:17:32.384 --> 00:17:35.788 line:95%,end
What's the difference between
a bitchy queen and an evil
queen?

00:17:35.854 --> 00:17:38.057 line:95%,end
A bitchy queen will say,
are you going to wear that?

00:17:38.123 --> 00:17:40.893 line:95%,end
And the evil queen will say,
you look terrific.

00:17:40.959 --> 00:17:42.194 line:95%,end
That's who Cathy is.

00:17:42.261 --> 00:17:44.730 line:95%,end
NADINE: I actually think Vivi
is the mastermind behind Cathy.

00:17:44.797 --> 00:17:46.899 line:95%,end
She's actually not a baby.
She's actually 47.

00:17:46.965 --> 00:17:48.967 line:95%,end
She's a 47-year-old woman.

00:17:50.669 --> 00:17:52.404 line:95%,end
NADINE: She doesn't speak,
because she actually controls--

00:17:52.471 --> 00:17:56.875 line:95%,end
She never speaks. She kind of
just lurks by the table, like,
during the auditions--

00:17:56.909 --> 00:17:59.912 line:95%,end
Right. And then he eats ice
cream. And she's just like--

00:17:59.978 --> 00:18:01.847 line:95%,end
JEFF: So listen, a lot of fans
have been asking about

00:18:01.914 --> 00:18:03.982 line:95%,end
where Cathy's money comes from.

00:18:04.049 --> 00:18:06.485 line:95%,end
So I think we may have found the
answer. Take a look at this.

00:18:07.753 --> 00:18:10.889 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: We got a
phone call from Cathy.

00:18:10.956 --> 00:18:12.458 line:95%,end
That--

00:18:12.524 --> 00:18:16.695 line:95%,end
I know that she is up to no
good. So whatever it is, it's
manipulative.

00:18:16.762 --> 00:18:18.997 line:95%,end
You know how her husband owns
that beef jerky thing, right?

00:18:19.064 --> 00:18:22.534 line:95%,end
Well, he was doing a commercial
for the store.

00:18:22.601 --> 00:18:27.106 line:95%,end
And Cathy called. And she
offered Chloe a job to go be in
the commercial.

00:18:27.172 --> 00:18:29.975 line:95%,end
ABBY: Oh.
So that's where you were
yesterday.

00:18:30.042 --> 00:18:31.844 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: So here's a commercial.

00:18:33.645 --> 00:18:37.082 line:95%,end
MAN (ON TV): We got beef jerky,
turkey jerky, chicken jerky.

00:18:37.116 --> 00:18:39.651 line:95%,end
Hell, my mouth's on fire jerky.

00:18:39.718 --> 00:18:44.389 line:95%,end
If you can jerk it, Tommy's got
it, because no one jerks it like
Tommy.

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:47.025 line:95%,end
This ain't my first rodeo.

00:18:47.092 --> 00:18:49.428 line:95%,end
GIRLS: Mm. Good.

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:52.931 line:95%,end
KELLY: She's a piece of meat.

00:18:52.998 --> 00:18:57.169 line:95%,end
Do you think she had her come
to, like, humiliate her?

00:18:57.236 --> 00:18:58.871 line:95%,end
Absolutely.

00:19:00.305 --> 00:19:03.041 line:95%,end
Isn't that every
dancer's worst nightmare,

00:19:03.108 --> 00:19:06.178 line:95%,end
that my beef jerky past
is going to come up at some
point?

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:10.249 line:95%,end
JEFF: You know, Dr. Holly,
she lost it this year.

00:19:10.315 --> 00:19:12.851 line:95%,end
And she called Abby a
monstrosity of evil.

00:19:13.519 --> 00:19:15.454 line:95%,end
JEFF: And I said to Abby,
do you even know what that
means?

00:19:15.521 --> 00:19:16.522 line:95%,end
- Yes.
JEFF: I don't know what that
means.

00:19:16.588 --> 00:19:21.226 line:95%,end
- A monstrosity.
- She used great words, you
know?


00:19:21.293 --> 00:19:23.128 line:95%,end
All right. So the conflicts and
rivalries on the show

00:19:23.195 --> 00:19:26.732 line:95%,end
not only make for some great
television, they coin some
interesting insults.

00:19:26.798 --> 00:19:30.269 line:95%,end
You might want to grab a pen
and take notes on this one.

00:19:31.537 --> 00:19:34.239 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: So what's your
group dance this week?

00:19:34.306 --> 00:19:37.075 line:95%,end
- Are you riding unicycles?
- You're a smart girl.

00:19:37.142 --> 00:19:39.444 line:95%,end
- What's it look like?
- Oh, I don't know.

00:19:39.511 --> 00:19:42.181 line:95%,end
- It's like a bicycle wheel.
- So what's it to you?

00:19:42.247 --> 00:19:43.815 line:95%,end
I'm just asking what
your gimmick is this week.

00:19:43.882 --> 00:19:45.250 line:95%,end
- You always have one.
- There's no gimmick.

00:19:45.317 --> 00:19:48.020 line:95%,end
That gimmick tends to beat you,
every once in a while.

00:19:48.086 --> 00:19:50.489 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Every once in a while.
- Where did you guys get these?

00:19:50.522 --> 00:19:53.158 line:95%,end
- From Cathy's wheelchair?
CATHY: Ah, no, Jill.

00:19:53.225 --> 00:19:56.395 line:95%,end
JILL: You gotta admit, that's
funny. That's funny. Come on.

00:19:56.461 --> 00:19:57.996 line:95%,end
CATHY: Oh, yeah.
We're all laughing.

00:19:58.063 --> 00:20:00.299 line:95%,end
And how old are
you, double chin?

00:20:01.533 --> 00:20:04.836 line:95%,end
- Not as old as you.
CATHY: Oh, really?

00:20:04.903 --> 00:20:07.439 line:95%,end
Who would know
with all the work you've had
done?

00:20:07.506 --> 00:20:10.442 line:95%,end
- Okay. Turn around if you don't
like it. - I don't need to turn
around, Jill.

00:20:10.509 --> 00:20:12.744 line:95%,end
- Then shut up.
- No. I don't need to shut up
either.

00:20:12.811 --> 00:20:14.846 line:95%,end
- Yes, you do. Okay.
CATHY: No. I don't.

00:20:14.913 --> 00:20:17.482 line:95%,end
- I don't think you can.
JILL: And listen, there are
children here.

00:20:17.549 --> 00:20:19.351 line:95%,end
- So watch your mouth.
- I don't have to watch my
mouth, Jill.

00:20:19.418 --> 00:20:21.954 line:95%,end
- Watch your ugly mouth.
- I don't have to watch my ugly
mouth.

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:23.655 line:95%,end
- It's ugly, like you.
- You should talk about ugly.

00:20:23.722 --> 00:20:25.891 line:95%,end
Everybody thinks you're
a man in disguise.

00:20:27.659 --> 00:20:31.196 line:95%,end
CATHY: Jaylen, you have to
continue to take dance classes.

00:20:31.263 --> 00:20:33.599 line:95%,end
And you want to be
well-rounded, yes?

00:20:33.665 --> 00:20:35.300 line:95%,end
Just not well-rounded like Abby.

00:20:36.668 --> 00:20:40.572 line:95%,end
ABBY: Do you think I've given up
my whole life in all the
organizations

00:20:40.639 --> 00:20:44.142 line:95%,end
that I belong to
to deal with that piece of crap?

00:20:44.209 --> 00:20:47.446 line:95%,end
No. She is dirt under my feet.

00:20:48.513 --> 00:20:50.882 line:95%,end
She hit me. There's
no going back.

00:20:50.949 --> 00:20:53.852 line:95%,end
- I'm sorry you guys are
miserable. - I'm not miserable.

00:20:53.919 --> 00:20:57.422 line:95%,end
- Our kids are happy. They--
- Look at me when you talk to
me.

00:20:57.489 --> 00:21:00.425 line:95%,end
I don't want to look at you
when I talk to you.

00:21:00.492 --> 00:21:03.462 line:95%,end
You guys are so caught
up on, oh, my God,

00:21:03.528 --> 00:21:06.365 line:95%,end
complaining about every little
[bleep] thing that happens.

00:21:06.398 --> 00:21:09.835 line:95%,end
- I'm looking you in the eye,
bitch. - Bitch, let's go. Let's
go.

00:21:09.901 --> 00:21:11.403 line:95%,end
- I'm not that way.
- Exactly. Sit down.

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:13.939 line:95%,end
Do not call me a bitch
if you can't back it up.

00:21:14.873 --> 00:21:16.541 line:95%,end
Oh, my gosh, guys,
where do we begin?

00:21:16.608 --> 00:21:19.878 line:95%,end
First of all, I think
that skinny Christi

00:21:19.945 --> 00:21:24.149 line:95%,end
is, like, the Queen Latifah
of "Dance Moms." Is she not?

00:21:24.216 --> 00:21:27.853 line:95%,end
She has to sit like
this to hold up her boobs.

00:21:27.919 --> 00:21:30.622 line:95%,end
NADINE: I felt like she was
gonna float away a little bit.

00:21:33.091 --> 00:21:35.427 line:95%,end
I wanted to say something
about Cathy though.

00:21:35.494 --> 00:21:38.163 line:95%,end
The last time I saw her,
she got lots of work done.

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:40.599 line:95%,end
- Did you notice that? She's
like this? - Did she?

00:21:40.666 --> 00:21:42.768 line:95%,end
- Is she?
- Oh.

00:21:42.801 --> 00:21:45.070 line:95%,end
ABBY: Really?
- And Jill said, look. I said, I
know.

00:21:45.137 --> 00:21:47.105 line:95%,end
- I saw.
ABBY: Ooh.

00:21:47.172 --> 00:21:49.041 line:95%,end
Oh, she did something.
There was something going on.

00:21:49.107 --> 00:21:51.543 line:95%,end
- Well, the meat didn't pay for
that. MELISSA: Something going
on there.

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:53.545 line:95%,end
The jerky didn't pay for that.

00:21:54.813 --> 00:21:56.915 line:95%,end
I think they could take
the insults even further.

00:21:56.982 --> 00:21:59.451 line:95%,end
Do a whole round of
your dance mama is so--

00:21:59.518 --> 00:22:00.519 line:95%,end
Are we going there?

00:22:00.585 --> 00:22:02.988 line:95%,end
Your dance mama so dumb

00:22:03.055 --> 00:22:05.157 line:95%,end
she bought point
shoes for her fingers.

00:22:06.825 --> 00:22:08.527 line:95%,end
NADINE: Your dance mama's
so dumb,

00:22:08.593 --> 00:22:12.731 line:95%,end
when they told her she was
pigeon toed, she went to the vet
and got X-rays.

00:22:14.132 --> 00:22:19.104 line:95%,end
Your dance mama's so stupid, she
doesn't know what comes after
five, six, seven.

00:22:20.806 --> 00:22:24.142 line:95%,end
NADINE: Your dance
mama is so stupid

00:22:24.209 --> 00:22:27.212 line:95%,end
that when Abby told her to put
her daughter's hair in a bun,

00:22:27.279 --> 00:22:29.448 line:95%,end
she went and got out a baguette.

00:22:30.215 --> 00:22:33.018 line:95%,end
ALEC: The level of that caliber,
perhaps. Thank you.


00:22:36.021 --> 00:22:38.890 line:5%,start
I'm here with our star, Abby Lee
Miller, Dance Mom, Melissa,

00:22:38.957 --> 00:22:43.562 line:5%,start
and super comedians and fans,
Alec Mapa and Nadine Rajabi.

00:22:45.897 --> 00:22:47.699 line:95%,end
The show has become
a huge success.

00:22:47.766 --> 00:22:50.569 line:95%,end
And as we all know,
imitation, and in this case,
parody,

00:22:50.635 --> 00:22:53.171 line:95%,end
is the sincerest form
of flattery sometimes.

00:22:53.238 --> 00:22:57.242 line:95%,end
So take a look at this clip
from "Dance Moms, The Musical."

00:23:46.391 --> 00:23:48.760 line:5%,start
[vocalization]

00:24:16.388 --> 00:24:18.390 line:5%,start
[evil laugh]

00:24:36.174 --> 00:24:37.742 line:5%,start
That girl's a good singer.

00:24:43.915 --> 00:24:45.917 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:24:47.319 --> 00:24:48.687 line:95%,end
How funny is that?

00:24:48.753 --> 00:24:51.256 line:95%,end
There were, like, three lyrics
to that song. Don't mess with
Abby Lee.

00:24:51.289 --> 00:24:54.025 line:95%,end
Do they really need the music
in front of them to remember
that?

00:24:54.092 --> 00:24:56.294 line:95%,end
NADINE: Right. Like, there were
no verses. - It was like, no
other words.

00:24:56.361 --> 00:24:59.231 line:95%,end
Don't mess. Don't
mess. I got it.

00:25:00.799 --> 00:25:04.903 line:95%,end
There's a really, really good
studio in South Carolina.

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:09.975 line:95%,end
And their big production number
this year with 70 kids in it is
"Dance Moms."

00:25:10.041 --> 00:25:14.279 line:95%,end
And they took clips from the
show, like voice bites from the
show.

00:25:14.346 --> 00:25:16.982 line:95%,end
Now, how do you find out about
it? Do people send you stuff all
the time?


00:25:17.048 --> 00:25:20.151 line:95%,end
ABBY: No. I just I know them,
and I've heard through the--

00:25:20.218 --> 00:25:21.920 line:95%,end
No. I heard through
the grapevine.

00:25:21.987 --> 00:25:23.522 line:95%,end
I haven't seen it yet,
but I want to see it.

00:25:23.588 --> 00:25:24.689 line:95%,end
ALEC: That's so neat.
JEFF: All right.

00:25:24.756 --> 00:25:26.892 line:95%,end
So, Nadine and Alec, I'm gonna
mix things up here for a second.

00:25:26.958 --> 00:25:29.194 line:95%,end
I'm going to give you
guys 10 seconds each

00:25:29.227 --> 00:25:31.796 line:95%,end
to ask as many questions
as you can to Abby.

00:25:31.863 --> 00:25:34.299 line:95%,end
ALEC: All right. okay.
JEFF: All right. Nadine, you go
first. Go.

00:25:34.366 --> 00:25:35.800 line:95%,end
Who do you think dresses
the worst on the show?

00:25:35.867 --> 00:25:36.635 line:95%,end
Kelly.

00:25:36.701 --> 00:25:39.104 line:95%,end
Do you think that Jill kisses
your ass because she wants to
take Melissa's place?

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:40.572 line:95%,end
Jill buys nice gifts.

00:25:40.639 --> 00:25:42.807 line:95%,end
Do you think that Jill
is a horrible dresser?

00:25:43.041 --> 00:25:45.644 line:95%,end
- No comment.
- All right, times up.

00:25:47.078 --> 00:25:50.916 line:95%,end
JEFF: So Alec, I'll give you 10
seconds too. Ready? Go.

00:25:50.982 --> 00:25:54.786 line:95%,end
How do you manage to teach an
entire class without ever
moving?

00:25:54.853 --> 00:25:57.422 line:95%,end
Because I'm damn good.

00:25:57.489 --> 00:26:00.292 line:95%,end
Which celebrity have you met so
far that you were star struck
the most about?

00:26:00.358 --> 00:26:02.394 line:95%,end
- Whoopi Goldberg.
ALEC: Oh, that's a good one.

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:04.763 line:95%,end
JEFF: There you go. Time's up.
- Oh, rats.

00:26:04.829 --> 00:26:07.365 line:95%,end
JEFF: All right. Okay.
Fair enough, fair enough.

00:26:07.399 --> 00:26:09.367 line:95%,end
Whoopi Goldberg's a good one.

00:26:10.502 --> 00:26:11.770 line:95%,end
JEFF: Melissa,
here's one for you.

00:26:11.836 --> 00:26:15.740 line:95%,end
Which one of the dance moms
do you think has the biggest
butt?

00:26:15.807 --> 00:26:17.943 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Well, this is a good
question because

00:26:18.009 --> 00:26:21.613 line:95%,end
we see each other a
lot, you know, naked.

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:23.381 line:95%,end
- When?
MELISSA: Oh, my gosh.

00:26:23.448 --> 00:26:25.750 line:95%,end
We always walk in each other's
rooms when we get ready in the
morning.

00:26:25.817 --> 00:26:27.252 line:95%,end
JEFF: We've heard all
about your boobs, Melissa.

00:26:27.319 --> 00:26:30.589 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Oh, my gosh. I think
Holly probably has the biggest
butt.

00:26:30.655 --> 00:26:34.593 line:95%,end
ABBY: No way. Holly's bottom is
proportionate with the rest of
her--

00:26:34.659 --> 00:26:37.662 line:95%,end
- Well, her derriere. Kelly?
- Right.

00:26:37.729 --> 00:26:41.433 line:95%,end
When she buys all those dresses
that she thinks looks fabulous
on her,

00:26:41.499 --> 00:26:43.835 line:95%,end
the skirt is up in the back
and down in the front.

00:26:43.902 --> 00:26:46.738 line:95%,end
She doesn't, like, have
them hemmed correctly.

00:26:46.771 --> 00:26:51.242 line:95%,end
Therefore, by dressing,
Kelly has the biggest butt.

00:26:51.309 --> 00:26:53.044 line:95%,end
ALEC: I can't believe
that's the one big question

00:26:53.111 --> 00:26:55.413 line:95%,end
in the Twitter-sphere right now.
It's, like--

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:58.917 line:95%,end
That's the burning question out
there. Who has the biggest butt?

00:26:58.984 --> 00:27:01.252 line:95%,end
And that's not even--
that's not even an opinion
question.

00:27:01.319 --> 00:27:04.889 line:95%,end
There's, like, reality.
I mean, we could whip out a tape
measure.

00:27:05.857 --> 00:27:09.194 line:95%,end
JEFF: Another burning question
is, will we ever see Abby doing
some choreography?

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:10.929 line:95%,end
Will we ever see you dancing?

00:27:10.996 --> 00:27:12.831 line:95%,end
Well, I mean, that was like my
question is, like,

00:27:12.897 --> 00:27:15.533 line:95%,end
we see the end result
in the dance competitions.

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:18.103 line:95%,end
And we see you coach the kids
and make adjustments.

00:27:18.169 --> 00:27:21.072 line:95%,end
But we never actually see you
do the dance moves yourself.

00:27:21.139 --> 00:27:24.776 line:95%,end
Well, when dancers are
auditioning for professional
work

00:27:24.809 --> 00:27:27.045 line:95%,end
let's say, here in
LA or in New York.

00:27:27.112 --> 00:27:30.448 line:95%,end
You could have somebody
that is 75 years old

00:27:30.515 --> 00:27:32.717 line:95%,end
choreographing the show,
directing the show.

00:27:32.784 --> 00:27:36.054 line:95%,end
And they say, [inaudible],
glissade, gran jete.

00:27:36.121 --> 00:27:38.223 line:95%,end
You better know what it is,
If you have to have somebody get
up

00:27:38.289 --> 00:27:40.825 line:95%,end
and do it for you,
you're screwed.

00:27:40.892 --> 00:27:42.627 line:95%,end
I mean, I think that we
should just get to the point

00:27:42.694 --> 00:27:44.195 line:95%,end
where Abby just starts
pointing at people

00:27:44.262 --> 00:27:45.964 line:95%,end
and not even speaking at all.
Wouldn't that be the greatest?

00:27:46.031 --> 00:27:48.833 line:95%,end
Yeah. Just telepathically. It's,
like, you have to know what I'm
thinking.

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:50.301 line:95%,end
NADINE: With, like,
a laser pointer.

00:27:50.368 --> 00:27:53.071 line:95%,end
Some kids would get it,
and some kids wouldn't.


00:27:54.372 --> 00:27:56.307 line:5%,start
JEFF: I'm here with
the star of our show, Abby Lee
Miller,

00:27:56.374 --> 00:27:58.643 line:5%,start
dance mom, Melissa,
and superfan comedians,

00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:01.479 line:5%,start
Alec Mapa and Nadine Rajabi.

Moms." Cheers, guys.

00:28:04.582 --> 00:28:07.018 line:95%,end
Now, look, dance has
never been hotter.

00:28:07.085 --> 00:28:11.089 line:95%,end
How much of that do you think,
Abby, is due to the success of
your show?

00:28:11.156 --> 00:28:13.291 line:95%,end
- All of it.
- I'll drink to that.

00:28:13.358 --> 00:28:17.062 line:95%,end
ABBY: I have so many parents
and children telling me

00:28:17.128 --> 00:28:20.365 line:95%,end
that the child started to dance
because of our show.

00:28:20.432 --> 00:28:25.070 line:95%,end
They watch the kids on TV, and
they want to get up and do the
routines.

00:28:25.136 --> 00:28:29.507 line:95%,end
I believe that every child
should dance, for their posture,
for their self-esteem,

00:28:29.574 --> 00:28:31.943 line:95%,end
to get in front of a mirror,
to get in front of a live
audience,

00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:33.578 line:95%,end
to learn theater etiquette.

00:28:33.645 --> 00:28:36.214 line:95%,end
They're learning all of
those things in dance class.

00:28:37.048 --> 00:28:38.683 line:95%,end
ALEC: I want to go to dance
class right now.

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:41.653 line:95%,end
NADINE: I do too.
I want to do the grand jete.

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:43.688 line:95%,end
Me too.

00:28:43.755 --> 00:28:45.090 line:95%,end
JEFF: Speaking of
the grand jete,

00:28:45.156 --> 00:28:47.592 line:95%,end
why don't we take a look at
some of Abby's favorite dances.

00:28:47.659 --> 00:28:50.328 line:95%,end

clips for you. Take a look.

00:29:01.072 --> 00:29:04.008 line:95%,end
(SINGING) The sky was so blue

00:29:04.075 --> 00:29:04.843 line:95%,end
So good.

00:29:04.909 --> 00:29:08.246 line:95%,end
(SINGING) That it
wasn't blue any longer.

00:29:08.313 --> 00:29:13.318 line:95%,end
Every time that sky comes back
into my mind, the colors shift.

00:29:13.384 --> 00:29:17.522 line:95%,end
The blue gets bluer
and the horizon widens.

00:29:17.555 --> 00:29:19.824 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: When the words start
speaking for the group dance,

00:29:19.891 --> 00:29:23.361 line:95%,end
because there is no music, the
girls start crawling around on
the floor

00:29:23.428 --> 00:29:26.865 line:95%,end
and, like, punching themselves
in the face. And I thought,
well, okay.

00:29:26.931 --> 00:29:28.933 line:95%,end
At least you're being
the best that you can be.

nine to 10, Black Swan.

She was.

Ah.

00:30:40.972 --> 00:30:42.907 line:95%,end
You see her look at--

00:30:43.942 --> 00:30:45.844 line:95%,end
Ya.

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:48.947 line:95%,end
ALEC: How are you not
a nervous wreck watching that
live,

00:30:49.013 --> 00:30:50.481 line:95%,end
in the moment that it happens?

00:30:50.548 --> 00:30:52.984 line:95%,end
NADINE: Can I just go back to,
"I See the Kite Flying."

00:30:53.051 --> 00:30:55.854 line:95%,end
First of all, I thought that
I was in, like, a speakeasy

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:58.323 line:95%,end
in Williamsburg
and want to just snap it out.

00:30:58.389 --> 00:31:00.558 line:95%,end
ALEC: It was so emo. I thought
they were going to start
cutting.

00:31:00.625 --> 00:31:03.194 line:95%,end
ALEC: At some point.
ABBY: I think somebody was
cutting.

ALEC: Throughout, the moms are
like, what? What's going on?

00:31:07.165 --> 00:31:09.167 line:95%,end
Holly's face was great.

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:12.036 line:95%,end
NADINE: The Helen Keller was
fantastic because she committed.

00:31:12.103 --> 00:31:14.906 line:95%,end
She went full deaf and full
blind, because she couldn't find
her teddy bear.

00:31:14.973 --> 00:31:16.407 line:95%,end
And it was amazing.

00:31:16.474 --> 00:31:19.711 line:95%,end
ALEC: I love the topical dances,
like the texting dance.

00:31:19.777 --> 00:31:23.481 line:95%,end
You know, the dangers of
texting. You should get even
more political.

00:31:23.548 --> 00:31:27.619 line:95%,end
Like, all the girls should play,
like, missiles from North Korea.

00:31:27.685 --> 00:31:33.258 line:95%,end
And I could come in as Kim Jong
Un. You know, and have a solo.

00:31:33.324 --> 00:31:35.360 line:95%,end
You could do a dance
about gluten allergies.

00:31:35.426 --> 00:31:37.495 line:95%,end
Oh, my God.
That would be perfect in LA.

00:31:37.562 --> 00:31:39.430 line:95%,end
The kids could be dressed
up as wheat

00:31:39.497 --> 00:31:42.367 line:95%,end
and, like, slices of
bread and spaghetti.

00:31:42.433 --> 00:31:44.602 line:95%,end
And some of--
one of the kids could play,
like,

00:31:44.669 --> 00:31:48.873 line:95%,end
an intestinal tract that's being
attacked by all the gluten, you
know?

00:31:48.907 --> 00:31:51.509 line:95%,end
We could do Lindsay Lohan
going to rehab again,

00:31:51.576 --> 00:31:53.244 line:95%,end
and the girls can
all be the rehab.

00:31:53.311 --> 00:31:56.581 line:95%,end
ALEC: They could all be the
different mug shots are Lindsay
Lohan.


00:31:57.548 --> 00:31:59.083 line:95%,end
ALEC: Like through the years.

00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:01.252 line:95%,end
Like, they are each had,
like, a number in front of them.

00:32:01.319 --> 00:32:03.888 line:95%,end
ABBY: That's kind of what
the "I See A Kite" routine is.

00:32:03.955 --> 00:32:06.658 line:95%,end
- The kids are all locked up.
ALEC: This show has so many
levels.

00:32:06.724 --> 00:32:08.626 line:95%,end
- It's so good.
- It's like an onion.

00:32:08.693 --> 00:32:10.295 line:95%,end
Oh, my God. I love it.

00:32:10.361 --> 00:32:12.664 line:95%,end
JEFF: So guys, not everyone who
watches the show is an expert.

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:16.100 line:95%,end
So Alec and Nadine have come
up with a cheat sheet of dance
moves

00:32:16.167 --> 00:32:18.169 line:95%,end
so you can follow along.
You guys want to take it from
here.

00:32:18.236 --> 00:32:21.439 line:95%,end
Okay. Yeah. Hit it, hit it.
Roll them. Roll the clips.

00:32:22.473 --> 00:32:25.276 line:95%,end
ABBY: That's the PK turn of
death. NADINE: I think it's
called the spinner.

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:27.312 line:95%,end
The spinner. The spin-a-roony.

00:32:28.746 --> 00:32:30.915 line:95%,end
ALEC: Oh. okay. This one I
call-- I know this one.

00:32:30.982 --> 00:32:32.750 line:95%,end
This one is called the
chinny chinny chin.

00:32:32.817 --> 00:32:34.619 line:95%,end
- That's mine. I love that.
- Oh.

00:32:34.686 --> 00:32:36.854 line:95%,end
I was either going to call it
the chinny chin chin or the
bottoms up.

00:32:36.921 --> 00:32:39.524 line:95%,end
Either way, it's uncomfortable
for everybody to watch.

00:32:40.191 --> 00:32:42.393 line:95%,end
- Reminds me of prom night.
- Right.

00:32:45.763 --> 00:32:47.231 line:95%,end
So you're really tough.

00:32:47.298 --> 00:32:50.401 line:95%,end
Have you ever seen a kid
react to you in such a way,
like,

00:32:50.468 --> 00:32:52.203 line:95%,end
Oh. I was too tough on that kid.

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:55.273 line:95%,end
ABBY: Yeah. But I think I'm a
very good judge of character.

00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:59.077 line:95%,end
And I know what child can
take it and do it in private.

00:32:59.143 --> 00:33:02.113 line:95%,end
And which kid I'm going to go
after in front of 800 other
people.

00:33:02.146 --> 00:33:04.849 line:95%,end
ALEC: So are your kids the kind
of kids that can take criticism?

00:33:04.916 --> 00:33:06.317 line:95%,end
Are they-- they
have thick skins?

00:33:06.384 --> 00:33:09.253 line:95%,end
MELISSA: When Abby gives her
correction, Maddie fixes it
right away.

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:11.222 line:95%,end
ALEC: She doesn't take it
personally, and go off.

00:33:11.289 --> 00:33:13.124 line:95%,end
MELISSA: No.
She goes home and works on it.

00:33:13.191 --> 00:33:15.093 line:95%,end
It's kind of crazy how
she's a perfectionist.

00:33:15.159 --> 00:33:18.129 line:95%,end
I would take it personally,
because I'm a people pleaser.

00:33:18.196 --> 00:33:20.999 line:95%,end
I'm, like, a bottomless pit of
need aching to be loved.

00:33:21.065 --> 00:33:23.368 line:95%,end
So, like, if you criticized me,
I would disintegrate.

00:33:23.434 --> 00:33:25.169 line:95%,end
I would, like, turn
into a pillar of salt.

00:33:25.236 --> 00:33:28.639 line:95%,end
- But aren't you too the
Maddies? - Yes, I am.

00:33:28.706 --> 00:33:33.244 line:95%,end
ALEC: I'm a Maddie. Here, here.
Here's to Maddie.

00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:39.283 line:95%,end
JEFF: All right. So let's take a
look at some fan-favorite
costumes.

00:33:39.317 --> 00:33:41.019 line:95%,end
Here we go.

00:33:41.085 --> 00:33:44.288 line:95%,end
One, two, three.
Here's our bird.

00:33:44.756 --> 00:33:47.792 line:95%,end
- Here's our bird.
- With the bell.

00:33:47.859 --> 00:33:49.394 line:95%,end
Is that a misfire or favorite?

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:52.330 line:95%,end
I feel like the lion
ate the bird in this one.

00:33:53.031 --> 00:33:54.599 line:95%,end
It's like a bird that's already
been eaten.

00:33:54.665 --> 00:33:56.100 line:95%,end
- Right.
- Yeah.

00:33:56.167 --> 00:33:59.270 line:95%,end
ALEC: She shrunk in the wash.
- I'm sorry.

00:33:59.337 --> 00:34:00.671 line:95%,end
NADINE: Like the Shrinky Dinks.
You remember?

00:34:00.738 --> 00:34:01.672 line:95%,end
You put them in the
oven and they got all--

00:34:01.739 --> 00:34:04.142 line:95%,end
She heated up.
She got a little smaller.

00:34:04.208 --> 00:34:07.178 line:95%,end
Oh, my God. That's amazing.

00:34:07.245 --> 00:34:09.047 line:95%,end
- Oh.
- Jetsons.

00:34:09.113 --> 00:34:11.949 line:95%,end
It's Jetsons.
It's a little Judy Jetson.

00:34:12.016 --> 00:34:14.652 line:95%,end
- Oh, my gosh. She's so cute.
- So cute. I can't. I can't.

00:34:14.719 --> 00:34:17.355 line:95%,end
It's like Judy Jetson
meets Hello Kitty.

00:34:17.388 --> 00:34:19.957 line:95%,end
From back to the future.

00:34:20.024 --> 00:34:21.426 line:95%,end
You're not even supposed
to be seeing this.

00:34:21.492 --> 00:34:24.228 line:95%,end
It's messing up the space-time
continuum completely.

00:34:25.296 --> 00:34:26.564 line:95%,end
ANNOUNCER: Junior Small Groups--

00:34:26.631 --> 00:34:30.535 line:95%,end
NADINE: Oh, my God. Cyndi Lauper
called and wants her hair back.

00:34:30.601 --> 00:34:34.338 line:95%,end
ALEC: Oh. It's the
circle of life.

00:34:34.405 --> 00:34:35.606 line:95%,end
Oh, it's Bollywood.

00:34:35.673 --> 00:34:37.041 line:95%,end
[imitating Indian talking].

00:34:37.108 --> 00:34:40.144 line:95%,end
It's Bollywood.
This is a dance of your people.

00:34:40.211 --> 00:34:43.081 line:95%,end
Indian, Indian, Indian.

00:34:43.147 --> 00:34:45.883 line:95%,end
[vocalizing] Bollywood.

00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:49.187 line:95%,end
There aren't enough people
in the group for Bollywood, by
the way.

00:34:49.253 --> 00:34:50.721 line:95%,end
She got more crooked every day.

00:34:50.788 --> 00:34:53.458 line:95%,end
ALEC: You do that whole dance--
you choreographed this whole
thing

00:34:53.524 --> 00:34:54.959 line:95%,end
by just telling them what to do.

00:34:54.992 --> 00:35:00.131 line:95%,end
Yeah. But they take class,
and they are trained in class.

00:35:00.198 --> 00:35:02.733 line:95%,end
Oh. 1940s.

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:05.703 line:95%,end
They've got the [inaudible].
I heard tell about it.

00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:07.305 line:95%,end
I'm not that old.

00:35:09.407 --> 00:35:12.810 line:95%,end
JEFF: Wow. What do you think?
ALEC: How does it feel watching
that?

00:35:12.877 --> 00:35:15.480 line:95%,end
Can you remember all the work
that you put into it?

00:35:15.546 --> 00:35:16.681 line:95%,end
Yes. It's exhausting.

00:35:16.747 --> 00:35:19.517 line:95%,end
NADINE: I know the costumes
vary, but what do they range
from?

00:35:19.584 --> 00:35:21.919 line:95%,end
ABBY: Costumes range
anywhere from street clothing

00:35:21.986 --> 00:35:24.255 line:95%,end
that I went to the
mall and bought.

00:35:24.322 --> 00:35:28.025 line:95%,end
For $50 bucks a kid,
up to $350 bucks a kit.

00:35:28.092 --> 00:35:30.761 line:95%,end
We are doing new routines
every, single week.

00:35:30.828 --> 00:35:32.497 line:95%,end
So when you see the
kids go to competition

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:34.999 line:95%,end
and they're competing
against other studios,

00:35:35.066 --> 00:35:37.268 line:95%,end
those kids at
those other studios

00:35:37.335 --> 00:35:40.404 line:95%,end
have been working on
those routines for months.

00:35:40.471 --> 00:35:43.174 line:95%,end
Sometimes the costume
isn't about the money,

00:35:43.241 --> 00:35:45.943 line:95%,end
but about how quickly
we can get them done.

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:47.578 line:95%,end
We get the music on Tuesday.

00:35:47.645 --> 00:35:50.481 line:95%,end
And Friday,
we're on a bus going somewhere.

00:35:50.548 --> 00:35:54.418 line:95%,end
So when I sketch the costume
is after I've heard the music,

00:35:54.485 --> 00:35:56.354 line:95%,end
and I know what the
theme is going to be.


00:35:57.421 --> 00:35:59.857 line:5%,start
JEFF: I'm here with Abby Lee
Miller, the star of "Dance
Moms,"

00:35:59.924 --> 00:36:04.061 line:5%,start
Melissa, comedian superfans,
Alec Mapa and Nadine Rajabi.

00:36:04.762 --> 00:36:07.198 line:5%,start
JEFF: And this is
"Dance Moms Chatter."

00:36:07.265 --> 00:36:10.101 line:95%,end
All right. So one of the huge
topics that fans love to talk
about

00:36:10.134 --> 00:36:12.136 line:95%,end
on the chat sites is
Abby, and why we never

00:36:12.203 --> 00:36:14.338 line:95%,end
get to see her showing
the girls moves.

00:36:14.405 --> 00:36:17.441 line:95%,end
So you think you've seen it all
on "Dance Moms?" Think again.

00:36:17.508 --> 00:36:19.210 line:95%,end
Take a look at this.

00:36:20.244 --> 00:36:25.349 line:95%,end
ABBY: The world
was mine to give.

00:36:27.051 --> 00:36:29.620 line:95%,end
I must say, I'm surprised
that Abby is up.

00:36:29.687 --> 00:36:33.724 line:95%,end
Abby must really care about this
routine. She is actually up and
out of her chair.

00:36:33.791 --> 00:36:36.060 line:95%,end
ABBY: You don't understand.
I figure it all out ahead of
time,

00:36:36.127 --> 00:36:37.728 line:95%,end
before they get in there.

00:36:37.795 --> 00:36:40.031 line:95%,end
And hit it, hit it, hit it.

00:36:40.097 --> 00:36:43.134 line:95%,end
Stroll two, three,
four. Grand Plie.

00:36:44.202 --> 00:36:45.970 line:95%,end
- Wow.
- Try that.

00:36:46.404 --> 00:36:49.373 line:95%,end
Abby is funny looking
when she tries to do hip hop.

00:36:49.407 --> 00:36:53.211 line:95%,end
Cross. [inaudible]
turn, bevel. Kiss.

00:36:56.814 --> 00:36:58.950 line:95%,end
I love this one. Dig it.

00:37:00.484 --> 00:37:01.852 line:95%,end
[laughter]

00:37:01.919 --> 00:37:03.921 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:37:04.822 --> 00:37:07.225 line:95%,end
I love that you did that.

00:37:07.291 --> 00:37:09.894 line:95%,end
She really needs
to go on a date.

00:37:13.164 --> 00:37:15.833 line:95%,end
Oh here is--
Abby is going to do her drag
queen walk.

00:37:17.034 --> 00:37:19.403 line:95%,end
She's revving up
from head to toe.

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:21.973 line:95%,end
Mama's in the house.

00:37:22.039 --> 00:37:24.742 line:95%,end
- Pull down her shirt.
- Look. She's got her foot
beveled.

00:37:24.775 --> 00:37:27.378 line:95%,end
- Oh, the head's going.
- God.

00:37:27.445 --> 00:37:29.480 line:95%,end
The torpedoes are out.

00:37:31.382 --> 00:37:34.552 line:95%,end
Abby loves herself
a drag queen dance.

00:37:34.619 --> 00:37:36.754 line:95%,end
- Oh, lord help us all.
- Oh, watch out.

00:37:36.821 --> 00:37:38.956 line:95%,end
Everybody get out your
mental scrub brush.

00:37:39.023 --> 00:37:40.491 line:95%,end
- Okay. Here she goes.
- Oh, my God.

00:37:40.558 --> 00:37:42.627 line:95%,end
I hope you didn't do
that for her date.

00:37:42.693 --> 00:37:45.263 line:95%,end
- Oh, the wrists are limp.
- Oh, gross.

00:37:45.329 --> 00:37:48.032 line:95%,end
- Whatever that move is--
- Here it comes.

00:37:49.533 --> 00:37:51.736 line:95%,end
Did you see Holly's face?

00:37:52.737 --> 00:37:55.072 line:95%,end
Oh, my God. I think she thinks
she looks good doing that stuff.

00:37:55.139 --> 00:37:57.341 line:95%,end
I don't think that looks good.

00:38:01.579 --> 00:38:03.948 line:95%,end
What, what, what?

00:38:04.815 --> 00:38:06.217 line:95%,end
Thank you.

00:38:06.284 --> 00:38:08.686 line:95%,end
She's marking it.
She's marking the routine,
right?

00:38:10.421 --> 00:38:13.157 line:95%,end
- Listening to some music?
- Always.

00:38:13.224 --> 00:38:15.293 line:95%,end
Looks like you're
having a good time.

00:38:15.359 --> 00:38:16.994 line:95%,end
Hello.

00:38:21.365 --> 00:38:24.969 line:95%,end
I think that's one of
the big things of the show,

00:38:25.036 --> 00:38:27.338 line:95%,end
is that you get so
much accomplished

00:38:27.405 --> 00:38:29.907 line:95%,end
without ever moving
all that much.

00:38:29.974 --> 00:38:33.477 line:95%,end
It's like if there was a cooking
show where somebody stood off to
the side

00:38:33.544 --> 00:38:36.881 line:95%,end
and said, a pinch of salt.
Add some pepper.

00:38:36.947 --> 00:38:40.785 line:95%,end
Easy with the coriander. And
somebody was able to prepare
this gourmet meal.

00:38:40.818 --> 00:38:44.555 line:95%,end
- I mean, that's what it's like.
NADINE: It's like the IKEA of
dancing.

00:38:45.723 --> 00:38:47.591 line:95%,end
It's almost like you could just
diagram it, and they do it.

00:38:47.658 --> 00:38:49.226 line:95%,end
ALEC: Like you just
shout out the instructions,

00:38:49.293 --> 00:38:50.828 line:95%,end
and these kids do
whatever you want.

00:38:50.895 --> 00:38:52.330 line:95%,end
She does that,
and people just do things for
her.

00:38:52.396 --> 00:38:53.964 line:95%,end
ABBY: I delegate.
NADINE: She is the owner.

00:38:54.031 --> 00:38:55.666 line:95%,end
- She's allowed to, right?
ABBY: I delegate. That's right.

00:38:55.733 --> 00:38:57.468 line:95%,end
Yeah. But it goes beyond
the dance studio, right?

00:38:57.535 --> 00:39:00.237 line:95%,end
ABBY: I've been doing
this for 33 years.

00:39:00.371 --> 00:39:03.240 line:95%,end
- I got it down pat.
- It's her world. We just live
in it.

00:39:03.307 --> 00:39:05.843 line:95%,end
JEFF: Alec and Nadine, I want to
thank you guys for being our
guests.

00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:07.812 line:95%,end
- You're welcome.
JEFF: Before you go.

00:39:07.878 --> 00:39:09.780 line:95%,end
I want to know, do you have any
questions you want to ask Abby?

00:39:09.847 --> 00:39:12.983 line:95%,end
Yes. Are you moving to Los
Angeles, because I want you to
be my neighbor.

00:39:14.585 --> 00:39:16.921 line:95%,end
- She wants to move to Los
Angeles. - How about you?

00:39:16.987 --> 00:39:19.557 line:95%,end
My burning question is,
how would you rate me

00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:22.326 line:95%,end
and put me in your pyramid,
based on today?

00:39:22.393 --> 00:39:25.296 line:95%,end
Oh, I think you'd
make the middle tier.

00:39:25.363 --> 00:39:27.832 line:95%,end
But then again, I
haven't met your mother.

00:39:27.898 --> 00:39:29.734 line:95%,end
- That's true.
- Ah!

00:39:30.534 --> 00:39:32.937 line:95%,end
Nadine and Alec,
it's been fantastic having you.

00:39:33.003 --> 00:39:36.507 line:95%,end
I'm Jeff Collins, and this is
"Dance Moms Chatter" signing
off.

00:39:36.574 --> 00:39:41.545 line:95%,end
Join us next time for more dish
and much more drama from "Dance
Moms."

00:39:42.346 --> 00:39:44.348 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:39:47.585 --> 00:39:48.886 line:95%,end
ABBY: Next on "Dance Moms."

00:39:48.953 --> 00:39:52.089 line:5%,start
ABBY: All of you have the
opportunity to come and see me
in LA.

00:39:52.156 --> 00:39:53.290 line:5%,start
Maddie came out.

00:39:53.357 --> 00:39:55.493 line:5%,start
We made an agreement.
We all stood by that, and you
didn't.

00:39:55.526 --> 00:39:58.562 line:5%,start
ABBY: It has to be bigger. It's
boring. Boring.

00:39:58.629 --> 00:40:01.832 line:5%,start
She's going to die
alone with no friends.

00:40:01.899 --> 00:40:04.235 line:5%,start
I'm sure you wish I would die
in a car accident too.

00:40:05.069 --> 00:40:08.406 line:5%,start
ABBY: If you have any
regrets about your solo, Maddie,

00:40:08.472 --> 00:40:11.809 line:5%,start
now isn't the time to go out and
prove how wonderful you are.

00:40:11.876 --> 00:40:13.944 line:5%,start
I think today proved a lot.

00:40:14.011 --> 00:40:16.213 line:5%,start
I'm done. I'm so over it.
