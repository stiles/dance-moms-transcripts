ABBY LEE MILLER (VOICEOVER):
Previously, on Dance Moms.

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:06.272 line:5%,start
I have been officially
invited to be on The View.

00:00:07.574 --> 00:00:11.411 line:5%,start
I am going to have the competition team
perform The Last Text.

00:00:11.478 --> 00:00:13.747 line:5%,start
My foot doesn't hurt anymore.

00:00:14.147 --> 00:00:18.985 line:5%,start
-- only score that received
an absolute perfect entry, 124A.

00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:23.456 line:5%,start
Anybody have a broom for the clean sweep?

00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:24.791 line:5%,start
MOM: Mackenzie's injured, right?

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:26.259 line:5%,start
She was, you saw her crying.

00:00:26.326 --> 00:00:28.595 line:5%,start
I want to know where
the miracle came from.

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:30.663 line:5%,start
Why don't you call the
[bleep] doctor and ask him?

00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:33.133 line:5%,start
ABBY LEE MILLER (VOICEOVER):
Coming up on Dance Moms.

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:34.801 line:5%,start
Here we are, New York City.

00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:38.805 line:5%,start
Thank you for letting me on the team.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.142 line:5%,start
MELISSA GISONI: What do I have to do
to get Mackenzie to dance again?

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:44.110 line:5%,start
I really think that she
needs to go on The View.

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:49.249 line:5%,start
We are holding an open audition
for a contemporary dancer.

00:00:49.315 --> 00:00:50.984 line:5%,start
I danced with Mariah Carey.

00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:52.052 line:5%,start
Wow.

00:00:52.118 --> 00:00:53.086 line:5%,start
KRISTIE RAY: Who's going
to be in the dance?

00:00:53.153 --> 00:00:54.220 line:5%,start
ABBY LEE MILLER: I'm not sure yet.

00:00:54.287 --> 00:00:55.688 line:5%,start
MELISSA GISONI: I have
to fight for my daughter.

00:00:55.755 --> 00:00:57.323 line:5%,start
Let it die.

00:00:58.158 --> 00:00:59.692 line:5%,start
This is my decision.

00:01:01.661 --> 00:01:04.230 line:5%,start
[THEME - NIKKO LOWE, "LIVING ON
THE DANCE FLOOR"]

00:01:04.297 --> 00:01:07.567 line:95%,end
THEME SONG: Get up, get on the floor.

00:01:07.634 --> 00:01:10.737 line:95%,end
My world is with my girls.

00:01:10.804 --> 00:01:13.006 line:95%,end
Living on the dance floor.

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:23.083 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: Something
really exciting has happened.

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:26.252 line:5%,start
I have been called and
asked to co-host The View.

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:27.821 line:5%,start
Sitting next to Whoopi Goldberg.

00:01:27.887 --> 00:01:29.889 line:95%,end
This is crazy!

00:01:29.956 --> 00:01:31.524 line:95%,end
And I'm really excited about it.

00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:33.426 line:95%,end
The kids are coming along.

00:01:33.827 --> 00:01:37.030 line:95%,end
All right, here we are, New York City.

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:39.532 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:01:41.034 --> 00:01:44.571 line:95%,end
Remember, if you can make it here,
you can make it anywhere.

00:01:45.705 --> 00:01:50.743 line:95%,end
This week, we will be attending
the Masters of Dance competition,

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.245 line:95%,end
and it's going to be tough.

00:01:52.312 --> 00:01:54.180 line:95%,end
This is our first time showing up.

00:01:54.347 --> 00:01:56.883 line:95%,end
We will be the underdog.

00:01:57.117 --> 00:01:59.552 line:95%,end
And Cathy, who we
thought would be in Ohio,

00:02:00.253 --> 00:02:01.588 line:95%,end
she's here in New York City.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.593 line:95%,end
Last time she beat you, it was bad.

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.628 line:95%,end
A perfect score?

00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:10.063 line:95%,end
That doesn't happen too often.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.631 line:95%,end
She wants to do it again.

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:14.367 line:95%,end
You going to let it happen?

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.671 line:95%,end
Now, let's get to the pyramid.

00:02:19.706 --> 00:02:22.408 line:95%,end
On the bottom, Mackenzie.

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:24.844 line:95%,end
You don't dance,
there's nothing to critique.

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:29.916 line:95%,end
And next, Nia and Asia.

00:02:31.751 --> 00:02:35.021 line:95%,end
That wasn't a duet,
it wasn't partners working together.

00:02:35.088 --> 00:02:37.457 line:95%,end
It was you double-timing everything,

00:02:37.524 --> 00:02:39.192 line:95%,end
and it was you trying to keep up.

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:41.427 line:95%,end
[dance music]

00:02:45.632 --> 00:02:47.634 line:95%,end
And next I have Brooke.

00:02:48.902 --> 00:02:50.837 line:95%,end
You do that side aerial to one knee,

00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:53.139 line:95%,end
you're the first face that comes forward.

00:02:53.206 --> 00:02:56.109 line:95%,end
[dance music]

00:02:58.778 --> 00:03:00.280 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: You need to lock eyes

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:01.581 line:95%,end
with one of those judges.

00:03:01.915 --> 00:03:04.150 line:95%,end
You need to draw them in
and tell them that story.

00:03:04.217 --> 00:03:05.818 line:95%,end
All we saw was the top of your head.

00:03:06.252 --> 00:03:08.454 line:95%,end
And moving up, Paige.

00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:11.291 line:95%,end
Paige, you didn't draw my focus.

00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:13.793 line:95%,end
Not in a good way, not in a bad way.

00:03:13.993 --> 00:03:16.196 line:95%,end
I think that's a good thing.

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:19.832 line:95%,end
And next, Kendall.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.101 line:95%,end
Kendall, you've had a good run lately.

00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:24.070 line:95%,end
This week, you flew under the radar.

00:03:26.172 --> 00:03:27.340 line:95%,end
JILL VERTES: I'll take it any day.

00:03:27.407 --> 00:03:29.876 line:5%,start
Kendall's third on the pyramid,
I think it's great.

00:03:29.943 --> 00:03:32.745 line:5%,start
I think that's close to where she belongs.

00:03:33.146 --> 00:03:35.815 line:95%,end
And next, Maddie.

00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:41.454 line:95%,end
Last week, there was 11 points
between you and the next contestant.

00:03:41.521 --> 00:03:43.656 line:95%,end
This week, there was one.

00:03:44.557 --> 00:03:46.392 line:95%,end
You did not have your head in the game.

00:03:47.026 --> 00:03:48.027 line:95%,end
Wake up.

00:03:48.094 --> 00:03:51.297 line:95%,end
Taking a bite out of the Big Apple,
is Chloe.

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:53.166 line:95%,end
CHRISTI LUKASIAK: This is the first time

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:56.402 line:5%,start
Chloe's been at the top of the pyramid
this entire competition season.

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:59.572 line:5%,start
So it really goes to show
that she's back in the game,

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:01.074 line:95%,end
and you can't count Chloe out.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.842 line:95%,end
You stayed on your music Chloe,

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:06.379 line:95%,end
you remembered the choreography,
you applied the corrections,

00:04:06.446 --> 00:04:07.480 line:5%,start
you were beautiful.

00:04:07.547 --> 00:04:08.748 line:5%,start
Thank you.


00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:11.918 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: So this week
at the Masters of Dance,

00:04:11.985 --> 00:04:14.387 line:95%,end
everybody is in the group routine.

00:04:14.454 --> 00:04:16.856 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:20.126 line:95%,end
Asia, you're certainly
better on stage alone.

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.028 line:95%,end
You will be performing a solo.

00:04:24.864 --> 00:04:27.100 line:95%,end
I have another solo going to Chloe.

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:32.405 line:95%,end
Maddie, you will also be doing a solo.

00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:38.911 line:95%,end
I have one more routine to give out.

00:04:39.312 --> 00:04:40.613 line:95%,end
One more solo.

00:04:44.751 --> 00:04:49.055 line:95%,end
My last and final routine
is going to Kendall.

00:04:52.325 --> 00:04:55.094 line:95%,end
Now Jill, you can run along
to Henri Bendal and buy me a gift.

00:04:55.428 --> 00:04:56.396 line:95%,end
OK.

00:04:57.096 --> 00:04:59.232 line:95%,end
We have a lot
of choreography to get through,

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:00.700 line:95%,end
but first things first.

00:05:01.034 --> 00:05:03.970 line:95%,end
We need to work
on The Last Text for The View.

00:05:04.037 --> 00:05:07.206 line:95%,end
I've arranged for the kids
to perform on The View,

00:05:07.273 --> 00:05:09.709 line:95%,end
and we're going to do
our award-winning number

00:05:09.776 --> 00:05:12.645 line:95%,end
from the National Finals, The Last Text.

00:05:12.812 --> 00:05:15.581 line:95%,end
And Asia, you will be doing The Last Text.

00:05:19.385 --> 00:05:22.221 line:95%,end
MELISSA GISONI: Mackenzie's
been in the dance since the get go.

00:05:22.288 --> 00:05:23.790 line:95%,end
I mean and she's fine, you know?

00:05:23.856 --> 00:05:25.091 line:95%,end
She hasn't been dancing.

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:26.926 line:95%,end
And I would like her to be in it.

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:28.661 line:95%,end
Which, that's just it,
she hasn't been dancing.

00:05:28.728 --> 00:05:30.663 line:95%,end
Yeah, but I would like her to be in it.

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.966 line:95%,end
She's part of this team and she's been
here since she's three years old.

00:05:34.534 --> 00:05:36.102 line:95%,end
I think you should give her a chance.

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:39.872 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: Melissa, I need
you to let me work, understand?

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:42.308 line:5%,start
I think Mackenzie should be dancing
on The View, for sure.

00:05:42.375 --> 00:05:45.712 line:5%,start
She's been a part of this team
since the beginning.

00:05:45.778 --> 00:05:47.013 line:95%,end
And Asia just came.

00:05:55.254 --> 00:05:56.889 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: Come on,
let's move over here.

00:05:56.989 --> 00:05:59.892 line:95%,end
I want this to be on your
mind first, but you know it.

00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:01.260 line:95%,end
So we're just going to review it

00:06:01.327 --> 00:06:03.629 line:95%,end
and you all had some corrections,
that's we're going to do.

00:06:04.997 --> 00:06:08.935 line:95%,end
Mackenzie was originally
in The Last Text, but now I have Asia.

00:06:09.001 --> 00:06:11.804 line:95%,end
I really don't know what's
going on with Mackenzie's foot.

00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:14.407 line:95%,end
Melissa is the one that said
Mackenzie was hurt,

00:06:14.474 --> 00:06:17.443 line:95%,end
Mackenzie's crying, Mackenzie's in pain,
we went to a doctor.

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.078 line:95%,end
Blah blah blah blah blah.

00:06:19.145 --> 00:06:20.913 line:95%,end
And now we're here in New York City

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:22.815 line:95%,end
and the kids have a chance
to be on The View,

00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:25.985 line:95%,end
suddenly her foot's fine
and Melissa's back-pedalling again.

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:29.555 line:95%,end
Somebody's has to hold Melissa
accountable for her words,

00:06:29.622 --> 00:06:30.857 line:95%,end
and it's going to be me.

00:06:30.923 --> 00:06:33.292 line:95%,end
You don't want to hit your
grand jete behind Kendall.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.329 line:95%,end
Really straighten those knees
on that back handspring.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.233 line:95%,end
There wasn't enough energy in that arm.

00:06:40.299 --> 00:06:44.237 line:95%,end
It's like-- you can't put
your head on the floor, Paige.

00:06:47.173 --> 00:06:49.075 line:95%,end
Melissa, who do you--
what do you think is going to go on

00:06:49.142 --> 00:06:50.176 line:95%,end
with The Last Text?

00:06:50.243 --> 00:06:51.544 line:95%,end
Do you think that Asia's doing it,

00:06:51.611 --> 00:06:52.845 line:95%,end
or do you think she's
going to put Kenzie in it?

00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:54.680 line:95%,end
MELISSA GISONI: I would
assume that Asia's in it.

00:06:55.381 --> 00:06:56.449 line:95%,end
I don't know.

00:06:56.816 --> 00:06:59.118 line:95%,end
CHRISTI LUKASIAK: I think
at this point, I think it's Asia.

00:06:59.385 --> 00:07:00.486 line:95%,end
I'm going to talk to Abby about it.

00:07:00.953 --> 00:07:03.556 line:95%,end
- JILL VERTES: You did or--
- I'm going to. Absolutely.

00:07:03.623 --> 00:07:06.793 line:95%,end
I'm not going to let my daughter
just be here and not do anything.

00:07:06.859 --> 00:07:07.693 line:95%,end
It's not right.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.296 line:95%,end
That little girl has been dragged around

00:07:10.396 --> 00:07:13.366 line:95%,end
for the last three weeks, ready to dance,

00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:14.333 line:95%,end
and she's not allowed.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.235 line:95%,end
I'm totally backing Melissa.

00:07:16.702 --> 00:07:20.239 line:95%,end
Mackenzie feels better,
Mackenzie was in the dance,

00:07:20.306 --> 00:07:21.774 line:95%,end
it's Mackenzie's spot.

00:07:21.841 --> 00:07:22.809 line:95%,end
It's a no-brainer.

00:07:22.875 --> 00:07:24.610 line:95%,end
Asia's just practicing really hard so--

00:07:24.677 --> 00:07:26.579 line:95%,end
MELISSA GISONI: Why can't
they both be in the group?

00:07:26.646 --> 00:07:28.181 line:95%,end
Well, I don't know, you have to ask Abby.

00:07:28.247 --> 00:07:30.216 line:95%,end
That's Abby's call, it's not my call.

00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:32.051 line:95%,end
It's not the Asia's call, so--

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:34.620 line:95%,end
JILL VERTES: So you understand,
this was our national winning number,

00:07:34.687 --> 00:07:37.490 line:95%,end
why Mackenzie should be in it
and not Asia?

00:07:37.557 --> 00:07:39.225 line:95%,end
Have her add Kenzie to the group.

00:07:39.692 --> 00:07:41.794 line:95%,end
Mackenzie has put her time in.

00:07:41.861 --> 00:07:43.663 line:95%,end
KRISTI RAY: But I'm not
going to sit there and go,

00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:45.064 line:95%,end
Asia go, tell Abby.

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:46.332 line:95%,end
No.

00:07:46.399 --> 00:07:49.268 line:5%,start
Whoever Abby picks, I'm fine with.

00:07:49.335 --> 00:07:52.171 line:5%,start
But I do think that if Mackenzie
is really hurt,

00:07:52.238 --> 00:07:54.807 line:95%,end
that she shouldn't just be
automatically OK because

00:07:54.874 --> 00:07:55.875 line:95%,end
we we're going on The View.

00:07:59.679 --> 00:08:01.113 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: Mackenzie, come here.

00:08:02.348 --> 00:08:08.855 line:95%,end
I don't understand why your mom
is letting Asia walk in and take over.

00:08:09.522 --> 00:08:12.525 line:95%,end
She's had all this and all that,
and everyone's loving her,

00:08:12.592 --> 00:08:14.360 line:95%,end
and they're going to forget about you.

00:08:15.094 --> 00:08:18.264 line:95%,end
And your mom's just sitting out there
letting this woman come from California,


00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:20.566 line:95%,end
and take over everything.

00:08:21.033 --> 00:08:22.869 line:95%,end
Try to be overstretching your splits,

00:08:22.935 --> 00:08:24.237 line:95%,end
do something while you're in here.

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:28.541 line:95%,end
All right, now listen to me.

00:08:28.608 --> 00:08:32.612 line:95%,end
This is a very important opportunity
for your dance teacher.

00:08:32.945 --> 00:08:36.182 line:95%,end
This is national television.

00:08:36.249 --> 00:08:40.319 line:95%,end
This is The View, and I'm co-hosting it
for the entire hour episode.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.955 line:95%,end
I'm nervous. I am.

00:08:43.022 --> 00:08:47.226 line:95%,end
I'm going to count on you being
respectful, being well-behaved,

00:08:47.293 --> 00:08:48.628 line:95%,end
being perfect young ladies.

00:08:48.895 --> 00:08:53.666 line:95%,end
Acting like you are professional,
trained dancers.

00:08:53.733 --> 00:08:54.634 line:95%,end
Understood?

00:08:55.101 --> 00:08:55.968 line:95%,end
All right.

00:08:56.836 --> 00:09:00.540 line:95%,end
We do have a great number,
it's a very competitive week.

00:09:00.606 --> 00:09:04.310 line:95%,end
It's really important,
especially if it's such a--

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:06.612 line:95%,end
The boys scored a perfect score last time.

00:09:07.013 --> 00:09:09.015 line:95%,end
What if she is a co-host with Abby?

00:09:09.081 --> 00:09:11.017 line:95%,end
Abby will freak.

00:09:11.083 --> 00:09:14.820 line:95%,end
I would love it if Cathy
was a co-host on The View with Abby.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.595 line:95%,end
CATHY NESBITT-STEIN: Moms and dads,
come on in.

00:09:25.298 --> 00:09:28.000 line:95%,end
Welcome to the Big Apple.

00:09:28.067 --> 00:09:30.736 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:09:30.803 --> 00:09:33.172 line:95%,end
First of all, I want to tell you boys,

00:09:33.506 --> 00:09:36.776 line:95%,end
thank you so much for our clean sweep.

00:09:36.842 --> 00:09:38.611 line:95%,end
You were awesome.

00:09:38.811 --> 00:09:40.246 line:95%,end
Awesome.

00:09:40.546 --> 00:09:46.452 line:95%,end
So, I was very upset with Abby's
demeanor and behavior towards me.

00:09:46.752 --> 00:09:48.621 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: You
never produced anything.

00:09:49.622 --> 00:09:51.324 line:95%,end
She is dirt under my feet.

00:09:51.624 --> 00:09:54.694 line:95%,end
She also said that I was a joke,
a hack job,

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.396 line:95%,end
I don't have a nice studio.

00:09:57.463 --> 00:09:59.165 line:95%,end
She has to lose again.

00:09:59.565 --> 00:10:02.101 line:95%,end
My team is going to be competing
at a competition,

00:10:02.168 --> 00:10:04.704 line:5%,start
and I know that
the Abby Lee Dance Company

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:05.838 line:5%,start
is going to be here.

00:10:05.905 --> 00:10:11.043 line:95%,end
So, we are here in pursuit
of another win against Abby.

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:13.746 line:95%,end
So first we have Nick.

00:10:13.946 --> 00:10:16.816 line:95%,end
Nick, you were spectacular.

00:10:16.882 --> 00:10:19.652 line:95%,end
I mean, there wasn't
a dry eye at the competition.

00:10:19.719 --> 00:10:21.020 line:95%,end
- You were fabulous.
- NICK DANIELS: Thank you.

00:10:21.087 --> 00:10:23.055 line:95%,end
CATHY NESBITT-STEIN: Next we have Jalen.

00:10:23.122 --> 00:10:25.524 line:95%,end
You're in the middle,
right where you need to be,

00:10:25.591 --> 00:10:28.060 line:95%,end
in between the two tall towers.

00:10:28.127 --> 00:10:30.129 line:95%,end
And then we have Brandon.

00:10:30.196 --> 00:10:33.366 line:95%,end
And at the top of the pyramid is Zack.

00:10:33.432 --> 00:10:38.337 line:95%,end
And Zack, you are there
because you were top soloist.

00:10:38.404 --> 00:10:41.574 line:95%,end
And you are going to have a solo
again this week.

00:10:42.074 --> 00:10:42.908 line:95%,end
OK.

00:10:42.975 --> 00:10:45.845 line:95%,end
CATHY NESBITT-STEIN: I have brought
back Anthony Burrell

00:10:45.911 --> 00:10:47.813 line:5%,start
as our guest choreographer.

00:10:48.814 --> 00:10:51.784 line:95%,end
I think he's going to show
us some stuff this week

00:10:51.851 --> 00:10:55.287 line:95%,end
that is more what Anthony
has a passion for.

00:10:55.354 --> 00:10:56.722 line:95%,end
- Absolutely.
- Yeah,

00:10:56.789 --> 00:10:59.759 line:95%,end
CATHY NESBITT-STEIN: So we are going
to do a contemporary group.

00:11:00.359 --> 00:11:04.530 line:95%,end
We are holding an open audition here today

00:11:04.597 --> 00:11:06.732 line:95%,end
for a contemporary dancer.

00:11:09.969 --> 00:11:13.572 line:95%,end
The dance that Anthony
has choreographed and has visioned

00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:15.775 line:95%,end
is going to require a girl.

00:11:15.841 --> 00:11:17.543 line:95%,end
And our team is all boys.

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:19.245 line:95%,end
So we're coming into New York City

00:11:19.311 --> 00:11:22.081 line:95%,end
and we're going to hold an open audition
and look for a new dancer.

00:11:22.148 --> 00:11:25.718 line:95%,end
So I hope that everybody's happy
and pleased with what is going on,

00:11:25.785 --> 00:11:26.886 line:95%,end
because I know that I am.

00:11:26.952 --> 00:11:29.922 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:11:29.989 --> 00:11:32.992 line:95%,end
[cars honking]

00:11:33.793 --> 00:11:36.595 line:95%,end
MELISSA GISONI: Kenzie, come here.
So what did Miss Abby say to you?

00:11:44.003 --> 00:11:45.638 line:5%,start
But, what did you say?

00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:47.440 line:5%,start
I'm an eight-year-old kid,
what am I supposed to do?

00:11:52.478 --> 00:11:54.780 line:5%,start
MELISSA GISONI: OK, but what am I
supposed to do about it Kenzie?

00:11:55.114 --> 00:11:57.516 line:95%,end
I'm going to talk to Miss Abby about it,
because it's ridiculous.

00:11:57.583 --> 00:11:59.618 line:95%,end
You're a team member, you're fine,

00:11:59.685 --> 00:12:01.921 line:95%,end
you need to be in this dance.

00:12:01.987 --> 00:12:04.790 line:95%,end
I have to convince Abby
to let Mackenzie dance.

00:12:04.857 --> 00:12:08.427 line:95%,end
I'm not allowing this new Kristie
to come in and just take over.

00:12:08.494 --> 00:12:11.230 line:95%,end
Ab, what do I have to do to
get Mackenzie to dance again?

00:12:11.297 --> 00:12:13.833 line:95%,end
I've been very dedicated to you,
I would do anything you asked.

00:12:13.899 --> 00:12:15.067 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: This isn't about you.

00:12:15.134 --> 00:12:16.435 line:95%,end
I really have to teach her the solo.

00:12:16.535 --> 00:12:17.603 line:95%,end
This is about Mackenzie.

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:20.272 line:95%,end
I want her to dance
and she wants to dance, Ab.

00:12:20.339 --> 00:12:21.941 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: Asia, come on.


00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:30.082 line:5%,start
What do I have to do to
get Mackenzie to dance again?

00:12:30.149 --> 00:12:32.518 line:95%,end
I mean, I really think that
she needs to go on The View.

00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:34.353 line:95%,end
I just feel like you're
replacing Mackenzie

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.522 line:95%,end
and you don't want her anymore,
in the group anymore.

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:39.325 line:95%,end
And she really wants to dance, so bad.

00:12:39.391 --> 00:12:40.860 line:95%,end
And I've been very dedicated to you,

00:12:40.926 --> 00:12:42.128 line:95%,end
I would do anything you ask me to do.

00:12:42.194 --> 00:12:43.295 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: This isn't about you.

00:12:43.362 --> 00:12:44.897 line:95%,end
She just dances like a little kid.

00:12:44.964 --> 00:12:46.132 line:95%,end
MELISSA GISONI: She's eight.

00:12:46.198 --> 00:12:48.033 line:95%,end
I gave her one older routine this season,

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.735 line:95%,end
and she forgot it and stood on stage.

00:12:49.802 --> 00:12:52.238 line:95%,end
I think she draws eyes,
I think she's too short.

00:12:53.539 --> 00:12:54.707 line:95%,end
MELISSA GISONI: Asia's just as small.

00:12:54.774 --> 00:12:56.909 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: I know, but she wants it.
Her mother wants it

00:12:56.976 --> 00:12:58.677 line:95%,end
MELISSA GISONI: Mackenzie wants it too.

00:12:58.744 --> 00:13:00.546 line:95%,end
This is what this is about Mackenzie.

00:13:00.613 --> 00:13:03.382 line:95%,end
I want her to dance,
and she wants to dance, Ab.

00:13:03.449 --> 00:13:04.917 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: Asia, come on.

00:13:04.984 --> 00:13:06.452 line:95%,end
MELISSA GISONI: I'm definitely frustrated,

00:13:06.519 --> 00:13:08.988 line:5%,start
because Abby's like, nope, Asia's here,
she's going to dance.

00:13:09.054 --> 00:13:12.558 line:5%,start
Abby has always told me that she
wants my kids to stay as cute

00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:13.959 line:95%,end
as long as they can.

00:13:14.026 --> 00:13:17.696 line:95%,end
I don't want my daughter to be
sassy on stage at age eight.

00:13:18.197 --> 00:13:19.098 line:95%,end
Not at all.

00:13:19.165 --> 00:13:20.132 line:95%,end
What? What happened?

00:13:20.199 --> 00:13:22.201 line:95%,end
Did you have the courage to say something?

00:13:22.268 --> 00:13:24.804 line:95%,end
MELISSA GISONI: I said to Abby,
I said Mackenzie wants to dance.

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:26.272 line:95%,end
She wants to dance.

00:13:26.338 --> 00:13:28.040 line:95%,end
She says, well, you know,
Mackenzie's too short.

00:13:28.107 --> 00:13:30.409 line:95%,end
I said Asia's the same size as Mackenzie.

00:13:30.676 --> 00:13:32.578 line:95%,end
KELLY HYLAND: So what was the
outcome of the conversation?

00:13:33.045 --> 00:13:35.347 line:95%,end
MELISSA GISONI: She said Asia
wants it more than Mackenzie.

00:13:35.414 --> 00:13:37.149 line:95%,end
I'm like, OK.

00:13:37.216 --> 00:13:39.485 line:95%,end
She said you want more from Asia.

00:13:39.785 --> 00:13:42.288 line:95%,end
What am I here every freaking day--

00:13:42.354 --> 00:13:46.292 line:95%,end
OK, but Melissa, now you're getting mad
because she's saying that about Asia.

00:13:46.358 --> 00:13:50.262 line:95%,end
But whenever she says to me,
Maddie wants it more than your kids,

00:13:50.329 --> 00:13:52.665 line:95%,end
you two look at me and say I'm jealous.

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:54.533 line:95%,end
So like how do you like it?

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.136 line:95%,end
It's hard for me that
a stranger comes in--

00:13:57.203 --> 00:13:58.704 line:95%,end
KELLY HYLAND: Yeah it's hard for us too.

00:13:58.771 --> 00:14:00.039 line:95%,end
That's the same thing.

00:14:00.105 --> 00:14:03.809 line:95%,end
But you have to also respect
what they're feeling every week.

00:14:03.876 --> 00:14:06.045 line:95%,end
It's hard to see my
eight-year-old not dance.

00:14:06.111 --> 00:14:09.114 line:95%,end
I'm fully on Christi and Kelly's side.

00:14:09.181 --> 00:14:11.050 line:95%,end
JILL VERTES: Well, Of course you are,
because you want Asia in the number.

00:14:11.116 --> 00:14:12.117 line:95%,end
KRISTI RAY: It has
nothing to do about that.

00:14:12.184 --> 00:14:14.687 line:95%,end
If it was me,
I'd put agent Kenzie head to head.

00:14:15.588 --> 00:14:16.622 line:95%,end
Toe to toe.

00:14:17.122 --> 00:14:18.858 line:95%,end
So there's nothing for me to prove.

Do you know who
Candy Apples Dance Center is?

Yes.

She has to be dazzled.

00:14:52.691 --> 00:14:54.393 line:95%,end
So just go ahead
and give me your name, please.

we want another Maddie.

because of the name.

Sorry.

Let's go, let's move on.

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:28.761 line:95%,end
Oh, Hannah!

00:15:28.827 --> 00:15:30.162 line:95%,end
Drop your back, heads to the floor.

00:15:30.229 --> 00:15:31.497 line:95%,end
I was on the Katie Couric show.

00:15:31.563 --> 00:15:33.432 line:95%,end
I made it into ABT.

00:15:33.499 --> 00:15:35.234 line:95%,end
I danced with Mariah Carey.

00:15:35.301 --> 00:15:36.235 line:95%,end
Wow.

00:15:36.302 --> 00:15:38.103 line:95%,end
You have to be bigger than life, OK?

00:15:39.038 --> 00:15:40.572 line:95%,end
- Next group?
- CATHY NESBITT-STEIN: Next group.

00:15:40.973 --> 00:15:42.608 line:95%,end
Stop. Did you guys bring your resumes?

00:15:42.675 --> 00:15:43.542 line:95%,end
Yeah.

00:15:43.609 --> 00:15:44.510 line:95%,end
CATHY NESBITT-STEIN: I love that.

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:46.111 line:95%,end
ANTHONY BURRELL: Where's
the face, the emotion?

00:15:47.513 --> 00:15:49.381 line:95%,end
CATHY NESBITT-STEIN: The technique
that we're looking for,

00:15:49.448 --> 00:15:51.784 line:95%,end
I'm not really seeing with you guys.

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:53.185 line:95%,end
Nothing in that group.

00:15:53.252 --> 00:15:54.553 line:95%,end
ANTHONY BURRELL:
Don't be yourself, be beautiful.

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:57.489 line:95%,end
She was good but she wasn't like,
knocked me off my seat.

00:16:00.993 --> 00:16:04.096 line:95%,end
OK, so guys, thank you
so much for coming today.

00:16:04.163 --> 00:16:05.931 line:95%,end
ANTHONY BURRELL: Great job though, ladies.
Great job.

00:16:05.998 --> 00:16:06.999 line:95%,end
CATHY NESBITT-STEIN: Very nice job.

00:16:07.066 --> 00:16:09.468 line:95%,end
This is hard work auditioning people,
isn't it?

00:16:09.535 --> 00:16:11.470 line:95%,end
- I'm hungry.
- You're hungry also?

00:16:11.537 --> 00:16:14.139 line:95%,end
I asked for chocolate,
and we didn't get any.

00:16:14.206 --> 00:16:17.843 line:5%,start
Vivi like my little buddy and I trust her

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:20.312 line:5%,start
because Vivi has a really good insight.

00:16:20.713 --> 00:16:21.814 line:95%,end
How's your eyes?

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:22.781 line:95%,end
Are they burning?

00:16:22.848 --> 00:16:24.016 line:95%,end
Yeah, I don't know why.

00:16:24.083 --> 00:16:24.950 line:95%,end
I don't either.

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:27.252 line:95%,end
Hi there.

00:16:27.486 --> 00:16:28.787 line:95%,end
You are a dancer.

00:16:29.121 --> 00:16:30.155 line:95%,end
Yeah.

00:16:30.222 --> 00:16:31.724 line:95%,end
Yeah, OK.

00:16:32.157 --> 00:16:35.728 line:95%,end
Real quickly, what I'd like to know
is your name and your age.

00:16:35.794 --> 00:16:37.596 line:95%,end
Charles, I'm 10.

00:16:37.663 --> 00:16:38.797 line:95%,end
Are you sure you dance?

00:16:39.565 --> 00:16:40.432 line:95%,end
Yeah.

00:16:40.499 --> 00:16:41.834 line:95%,end
What type of dance do you do?

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:44.336 line:95%,end
I like to express myself while I dance.

00:16:44.403 --> 00:16:48.640 line:95%,end
Sometimes when I get mad,
I just dance and just it calms me down.

00:16:48.907 --> 00:16:50.442 line:95%,end
Very good. OK.

00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:51.810 line:95%,end
All right, let's go.

00:16:51.877 --> 00:16:52.878 line:95%,end
ANTHONY BURRELL: Dance, go.

00:16:52.945 --> 00:16:54.580 line:95%,end
Let me see who you are.

00:16:55.481 --> 00:16:57.950 line:95%,end
Yes, let go, let go, be free, be free.

00:16:58.017 --> 00:16:59.451 line:95%,end
Express yourself.


00:17:01.253 --> 00:17:03.889 line:95%,end
Go in guys, I'm not seeing enough.
I need face.

00:17:03.956 --> 00:17:06.825 line:95%,end
CATHY NESBITT-STEIN: OK guys.
OK. OK.

00:17:07.426 --> 00:17:08.994 line:95%,end
ANTHONY BURRELL: That was inspiring man.

00:17:09.061 --> 00:17:10.863 line:95%,end
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Never give up dancing, OK?

00:17:10.929 --> 00:17:12.664 line:95%,end
From a male dancer to another.

00:17:12.731 --> 00:17:14.666 line:95%,end
You have something special
and keep working hard, OK?

00:17:14.733 --> 00:17:17.169 line:95%,end
Are you the only boy that's out there?

00:17:17.236 --> 00:17:19.705 line:95%,end
- Please tell me no.
- Yes.

00:17:20.439 --> 00:17:21.940 line:95%,end
I said please tell me no.

00:17:25.844 --> 00:17:28.380 line:95%,end
KRISTI RAY: Asia, come here,
come over here.

00:17:29.114 --> 00:17:32.951 line:95%,end
This is for Abby for letting you
go on The View with the team,

00:17:33.018 --> 00:17:35.554 line:95%,end
because you're new here.
And for her to pick you to go on the team,

00:17:35.621 --> 00:17:37.723 line:95%,end
it's very important that
you show her appreciation.

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:40.092 line:95%,end
And I want you to sign this
and want you to take it in there

00:17:40.159 --> 00:17:42.428 line:95%,end
and show your appreciation
for letting you, OK?

00:17:46.231 --> 00:17:47.199 line:95%,end
OK, go on.

00:17:49.001 --> 00:17:50.702 line:95%,end
- ABBY LEE MILLER: What's that?
- KELLY HYLAND: What's this?

00:17:50.769 --> 00:17:51.770 line:95%,end
What's she doing?

00:17:51.837 --> 00:17:54.206 line:95%,end
It's a thank you card
for letting me be on the team.

00:17:54.273 --> 00:17:56.608 line:95%,end
Oh!

00:17:56.675 --> 00:17:59.044 line:95%,end
"They had written thank you cards,

00:17:59.378 --> 00:18:02.481 line:95%,end
but this one fit my gratitude better."

00:18:02.548 --> 00:18:03.382 line:95%,end
Thank you.

00:18:03.449 --> 00:18:05.317 line:95%,end
KELLY HYLAND: Maybe you should
have Kenzie give her one,

00:18:05.384 --> 00:18:07.052 line:95%,end
saying, "Please let me go."

00:18:07.753 --> 00:18:09.855 line:95%,end
JILL VERTES: It's a big pink elephant
on the front of the card.

00:18:09.922 --> 00:18:12.324 line:95%,end
CHRISTI LUKASIAK:
There is a pink elephant in the room.

00:18:12.891 --> 00:18:14.493 line:95%,end
For once it's not Abby.

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:17.396 line:95%,end
Thank you for letting me be
on The View with the other girls.

00:18:17.463 --> 00:18:20.199 line:95%,end
I appreciate this.
Very nice, sweetheart, thank you.

00:18:20.265 --> 00:18:22.101 line:95%,end
It was a very thoughtful gift,

00:18:22.167 --> 00:18:25.471 line:95%,end
and I really appreciate the time
and the energy

00:18:25.537 --> 00:18:27.072 line:95%,end
that she put into that gift.

00:18:27.139 --> 00:18:30.709 line:95%,end
I still haven't decided who is going
to be in the number and who isn't.

00:18:30.776 --> 00:18:34.513 line:5%,start
The jury is still out,
you might be in, you might not be in.

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:37.316 line:95%,end
All right, you have a solo
because we need the points.

00:18:37.382 --> 00:18:39.885 line:95%,end
You're in the mini division
and you need to win.

00:18:40.853 --> 00:18:41.854 line:5%,start
Let's go.

00:18:42.387 --> 00:18:45.290 line:5%,start
[dance music]

00:18:47.025 --> 00:18:50.195 line:95%,end
Asia has an amazing solo this week,
it's called the robot.

00:18:50.262 --> 00:18:53.832 line:95%,end
And it's going to be hard
to keep her a little stiff,

00:18:53.899 --> 00:18:54.967 line:95%,end
but we're going to try.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:58.103 line:95%,end
Ball change, glissade, jete.

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:00.339 line:95%,end
Hurry up!

00:19:00.405 --> 00:19:01.473 line:95%,end
Your foot sickled.

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:02.741 line:95%,end
All one motion.

00:19:02.808 --> 00:19:04.343 line:95%,end
Now you're going to push
away on your left foot.

00:19:05.544 --> 00:19:06.612 line:95%,end
No.

00:19:06.678 --> 00:19:07.679 line:95%,end
Your other left foot.

00:19:07.746 --> 00:19:13.152 line:95%,end
What part do I come up
and hold like this part?

00:19:13.218 --> 00:19:15.187 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: It's just like one, two.

00:19:19.124 --> 00:19:21.293 line:95%,end
JILL VERTES: I was actually
surprised Asia's doing a solo.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.095 line:95%,end
CHRISTI LUKASIAK: I think
it would be smarter if she would

00:19:23.162 --> 00:19:24.930 line:95%,end
have had Brooke do a solo.

00:19:24.997 --> 00:19:27.266 line:95%,end
You could have had solos
in an older age category,

00:19:27.332 --> 00:19:29.101 line:95%,end
the middle age category,
and the younger.

00:19:29.168 --> 00:19:31.203 line:95%,end
How long has it been since
my kids have had a solo?

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:33.438 line:95%,end
Like, they don't expect
to get a solo anymore.

00:19:33.505 --> 00:19:35.207 line:95%,end
JILL VERTES: But I heard
you say you don't--

00:19:35.274 --> 00:19:36.775 line:95%,end
I don't care.
I don't care anymore.

00:19:36.842 --> 00:19:38.010 line:95%,end
You know what, when I'm in New York,

00:19:38.076 --> 00:19:40.579 line:95%,end
I'm going to go and do things on my own,
without Abby.

00:19:40.646 --> 00:19:44.216 line:95%,end
Because obviously, Abbey really
could give a [bleep] about my two kids.

00:19:44.283 --> 00:19:46.518 line:95%,end
Asia has been on our
team for how many weeks,

00:19:46.585 --> 00:19:48.687 line:95%,end
and she's had how many duets and solos?

00:19:48.754 --> 00:19:50.856 line:95%,end
And that right there tells you.

00:19:51.223 --> 00:19:52.391 line:95%,end
Do it myself.

00:19:52.457 --> 00:19:54.459 line:95%,end
Are you going to try
to do the modeling thing for Paige?

00:19:54.526 --> 00:19:55.727 line:95%,end
I would love to, yes.

00:19:55.794 --> 00:19:57.930 line:95%,end
Because isn't that a big agencies--

00:19:57.996 --> 00:19:59.464 line:95%,end
CHRISTI LUKASIAK: Preach, sister, preach.

00:19:59.631 --> 00:20:02.000 line:5%,start
I'm going to play
the momager role this week.

00:20:02.067 --> 00:20:05.504 line:5%,start
I'm in New York City,
neither one of my kids have a solo.

00:20:05.571 --> 00:20:08.640 line:95%,end
I'm going to take them out,
and I'm going to do things for them

00:20:08.707 --> 00:20:09.841 line:95%,end
to get them ahead.

00:20:15.047 --> 00:20:17.449 line:5%,start
CATHY NESBITT-STEIN: Vivi,
what do you think about that last group?

00:20:17.816 --> 00:20:19.618 line:95%,end
No I don't really like them that much.

00:20:19.685 --> 00:20:21.386 line:95%,end
They were terrible.

00:20:21.853 --> 00:20:22.754 line:95%,end
I know.

00:20:22.821 --> 00:20:25.524 line:95%,end
I mean, the little girl in the mint,
she's borderline.

00:20:25.591 --> 00:20:28.994 line:95%,end
And I liked Maddie,
only because she's experienced.

00:20:29.061 --> 00:20:31.797 line:95%,end
And she's had,
she had good ballet training.

00:20:31.863 --> 00:20:33.365 line:95%,end
You could tell just by
the way she held herself.

00:20:33.432 --> 00:20:35.400 line:95%,end
- Yeah.
- What do you think about the 12-year-old?

00:20:35.467 --> 00:20:38.103 line:95%,end
I think she's too big for the guys,
like mass-wise.

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:39.471 line:95%,end
She's very mature looking.

00:20:39.538 --> 00:20:41.807 line:95%,end
I like that one that's 10 better than her.

00:20:41.873 --> 00:20:44.076 line:95%,end
I mean, she has the facility
and information,

00:20:44.142 --> 00:20:47.112 line:95%,end
but I think with her instrument,
it's enough.

00:20:47.179 --> 00:20:49.414 line:95%,end
CATHY NESBITT-STEIN: The three boys that
are going to be doing the group dance

00:20:49.481 --> 00:20:51.450 line:95%,end
all have such wonderful qualities.

00:20:51.516 --> 00:20:55.320 line:95%,end
So I'm looking for another team
player that's just going to fit

00:20:55.387 --> 00:20:56.388 line:95%,end
right in with these boys.

00:20:56.455 --> 00:20:58.257 line:95%,end
That's going to gel immediately.

00:20:58.323 --> 00:21:01.927 line:95%,end
So, guys, you are the
finalists, which in itself,

00:21:01.994 --> 00:21:03.362 line:95%,end
that was a big win, OK?

00:21:03.428 --> 00:21:05.197 line:95%,end
Charles, step forward please.

00:21:06.131 --> 00:21:09.901 line:95%,end
You are like very inspirational.

00:21:09.968 --> 00:21:12.671 line:95%,end
I want to tell you to keep up
the good work,

00:21:12.738 --> 00:21:16.241 line:95%,end
because the boys are few and far between.

00:21:16.308 --> 00:21:17.509 line:95%,end
I got chills right now,

00:21:17.576 --> 00:21:20.312 line:95%,end
because I know being who you are,
a young little boy,

00:21:20.379 --> 00:21:23.048 line:95%,end
you get teased and called
names for doing what you do.

00:21:23.115 --> 00:21:24.516 line:95%,end
And I was once this little kid.

00:21:24.583 --> 00:21:27.886 line:95%,end
Wherever this leads today, continue.
Continue man.

00:21:27.953 --> 00:21:30.422 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:21:30.489 --> 00:21:32.190 line:95%,end
You did-- all did an awesome job,

00:21:32.257 --> 00:21:36.461 line:95%,end
but we both have decided upon number--


00:21:39.231 --> 00:21:40.899 line:95%,end
All right guys, in a straight line please.

00:21:40.966 --> 00:21:42.668 line:95%,end
You did-- all did an awesome job,

00:21:43.001 --> 00:21:47.239 line:95%,end
but we both have decided
upon number,

00:21:49.808 --> 00:21:52.411 line:95%,end
number 80516.

00:21:52.477 --> 00:21:54.012 line:95%,end
Victoria!

00:21:54.079 --> 00:21:55.981 line:95%,end
It was a hard decision.

00:21:56.048 --> 00:21:57.949 line:5%,start
Victoria comes from Studio Larken,

00:21:58.016 --> 00:22:00.919 line:5%,start
and they have a fabulous reputation.

00:22:00.986 --> 00:22:04.723 line:95%,end
Not only that, I think that
Abby has seen them before

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:08.527 line:95%,end
and it's going to be kind of fun
if she recognizes Victoria,

00:22:08.593 --> 00:22:10.495 line:95%,end
and now Victoria's on our team.

00:22:10.829 --> 00:22:12.397 line:95%,end

00:22:13.732 --> 00:22:15.500 line:95%,end

Five, six, seven, eight.

00:22:24.576 --> 00:22:29.915 line:5%,start
Step, fan, behind, push,
back black isn't high enough.

00:22:29.981 --> 00:22:32.384 line:95%,end
The group dance this week
is called runaways.

00:22:32.918 --> 00:22:35.620 line:95%,end
They end up all alone and on the streets.

00:22:35.687 --> 00:22:37.956 line:95%,end
It's a topic that needs attention.

00:22:38.023 --> 00:22:40.025 line:95%,end
So if you think it's bad at home,

00:22:40.092 --> 00:22:44.029 line:95%,end
believe me it's much worse
to be cold and hungry

00:22:44.096 --> 00:22:45.697 line:95%,end
and alone on the streets.

00:22:45.764 --> 00:22:48.500 line:95%,end
Brooke, you're still bending
your knee every time you fan.

00:22:48.567 --> 00:22:51.503 line:95%,end
It's like you're walking
through mud or water.

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:53.071 line:95%,end
Push, push.

00:22:53.138 --> 00:22:55.474 line:95%,end
Imagine trying to get down
the sidewalk in New York City,

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:57.943 line:95%,end
and all these people
are rushing towards you.

00:22:59.244 --> 00:23:01.446 line:95%,end
Push them out of the way, use your elbows.

00:23:03.415 --> 00:23:05.884 line:95%,end
CHRISTI LUKASIAK: I'm really
worried about the theme.

00:23:06.985 --> 00:23:09.054 line:95%,end
It is a relevant topic.

00:23:09.121 --> 00:23:11.323 line:95%,end
I think it's going to be like
The Last Text,

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:13.492 line:95%,end
where it's like sending a message.

00:23:13.558 --> 00:23:15.694 line:95%,end
Like, don't text and drive.

00:23:15.761 --> 00:23:17.429 line:95%,end
Like that's sending a good message.

00:23:17.496 --> 00:23:19.297 line:95%,end
Like I don't see it as being negative.

00:23:19.364 --> 00:23:22.134 line:95%,end
But I think it's one
of those opportunities that's

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.903 line:95%,end
a great way to raise
awareness and educate,

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:26.004 line:95%,end
if it's done tastefully.

00:23:26.071 --> 00:23:28.206 line:95%,end
I always think those
are the numbers that do well.

00:23:28.273 --> 00:23:29.608 line:95%,end
MELISSA GISONI: Like the children dance.

00:23:29.674 --> 00:23:31.743 line:95%,end
And I think that was freaky
when she explained to them.

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:33.345 line:95%,end
KELLY HYLAND: It was one
of their best numbers they ever did.

00:23:33.412 --> 00:23:34.513 line:95%,end
It was.

00:23:36.948 --> 00:23:39.217 line:95%,end
Paige, Brooke, you forgot what to do.

00:23:40.619 --> 00:23:41.820 line:95%,end
You forgot what to do again.

00:23:41.887 --> 00:23:44.055 line:95%,end
Now, I saw mistakes in the group routine.

00:23:44.489 --> 00:23:45.557 line:95%,end
I saw a lot of mistakes.

00:23:45.624 --> 00:23:48.059 line:5%,start
The girls just don't look clean,
they don't look sharp,

00:23:48.126 --> 00:23:49.528 line:95%,end
they don't look tight.

00:23:49.594 --> 00:23:51.696 line:95%,end
They need to win.

00:23:51.763 --> 00:23:54.332 line:95%,end
We need to go out there
and beat Cathy's boys.

00:23:54.666 --> 00:23:56.601 line:95%,end
Girls, get it together.

00:23:56.668 --> 00:23:59.805 line:95%,end
You need to step on stage,
and you need to beat her.

00:24:00.105 --> 00:24:01.440 line:95%,end
All right, that's it.

00:24:01.506 --> 00:24:03.375 line:95%,end
Wrap them. Done.
I can't look at them anymore.

00:24:04.943 --> 00:24:07.746 line:95%,end
I am not reviewing one step.

00:24:09.014 --> 00:24:11.583 line:95%,end
If you come in here
and you do something wrong,

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:13.852 line:95%,end
or you forgot something, eeh.

00:24:14.653 --> 00:24:16.621 line:95%,end
Do something for yourself.

00:24:16.688 --> 00:24:20.292 line:95%,end
The whole world does not hand you
your life on a silver platter.

00:24:22.994 --> 00:24:23.995 line:95%,end
Figure it out.

00:24:26.698 --> 00:24:28.700 line:95%,end
CATHY NESBITT-STEIN: Let's go.
Let's go get some cheesecake.

00:24:29.167 --> 00:24:31.436 line:95%,end
- So, you're having fun?
- Yep

00:24:31.503 --> 00:24:32.771 line:95%,end
Ready for some cheesecake?

00:24:34.005 --> 00:24:35.240 line:95%,end
- WAITER: Hi ladies, how are you?
- Hi. Good.

00:24:35.307 --> 00:24:37.142 line:95%,end
Good afternoon. Welcome to Juniors.

00:24:37.209 --> 00:24:38.343 line:95%,end
CATHY NESBITT-STEIN:
We're actually here for dessert.

00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:40.545 line:95%,end
I want one with raspberry in it.

00:24:40.612 --> 00:24:42.380 line:95%,end
CATHY NESBITT-STEIN:
I'll just have a plain one of those, then.

00:24:42.447 --> 00:24:43.348 line:95%,end
- OK, thank you.
- Thank you, ladies.

00:24:43.415 --> 00:24:44.249 line:95%,end
All right.

00:24:44.316 --> 00:24:46.351 line:95%,end
And I want to tell you what,
I need this break.

00:24:47.252 --> 00:24:49.387 line:95%,end
Do you like the way we have
to get around New York?

00:24:49.454 --> 00:24:50.288 line:95%,end
No.

00:24:50.355 --> 00:24:53.325 line:95%,end
It's hard to get a taxi,
and then when you have to walk,

00:24:53.391 --> 00:24:54.659 line:95%,end
your feet start to hurt.

00:24:54.726 --> 00:24:55.861 line:95%,end
CATHY NESBITT-STEIN: Yeah.

00:24:55.927 --> 00:24:57.696 line:95%,end
What's your favorite thing
so far about New York?

00:24:57.762 --> 00:25:00.932 line:95%,end
Probably the shopping and stuff like--

00:25:00.999 --> 00:25:02.400 line:95%,end
Really? The shopping?

00:25:02.467 --> 00:25:04.970 line:95%,end
Oh honey, mommy's teaching you so well.

00:25:05.036 --> 00:25:07.772 line:95%,end
- And I like the pizza.
- I think you've had how many pieces?

00:25:07.839 --> 00:25:10.342 line:95%,end
About like five already.

00:25:11.443 --> 00:25:13.411 line:95%,end
So, what do you think of Victoria?

00:25:13.478 --> 00:25:15.013 line:95%,end
I think she's nice.

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:17.048 line:95%,end
Is she nice?
Have you guys had a moment to talk?

00:25:17.115 --> 00:25:19.885 line:95%,end
No, not really, but she seems
like she's probably nice.

00:25:19.951 --> 00:25:22.420 line:95%,end
I haven't really got to see
your dance again that much.

00:25:22.487 --> 00:25:23.688 line:95%,end
She's cute, huh?

00:25:23.755 --> 00:25:25.357 line:95%,end
Yes she's a cute little girl.

00:25:25.757 --> 00:25:27.993 line:95%,end
Why do you keep making rabbit noses at me?

00:25:28.059 --> 00:25:30.362 line:95%,end
Because my nose is stuffed up,
because I a cold.

00:25:30.428 --> 00:25:31.329 line:95%,end
Wipe it off.

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:33.532 line:95%,end
Go straight down.

00:25:33.598 --> 00:25:35.500 line:95%,end
I know, I know,
I know how to do that, yeah.

00:25:35.567 --> 00:25:38.069 line:95%,end
WAITER: Ladies, your dessert is here.

00:25:38.703 --> 00:25:40.305 line:95%,end
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

00:25:40.639 --> 00:25:43.174 line:95%,end
So, why do you think that
you and Jalen are so close?

00:25:43.475 --> 00:25:44.676 line:95%,end
I don't know.

00:25:45.043 --> 00:25:45.977 line:95%,end
Do you think that he's cute?

00:25:47.379 --> 00:25:48.513 line:95%,end
You don't think Jalen is cute?

00:25:49.347 --> 00:25:51.716 line:95%,end
Like you wouldn't consider
him like a boyfriend?

00:25:52.817 --> 00:25:53.919 line:95%,end
Just a friend?

00:25:53.985 --> 00:25:59.658 line:95%,end
I don't think it would hurt
if you admitted that you think

00:25:59.724 --> 00:26:01.526 line:95%,end
Jalen's pretty cute.

00:26:02.827 --> 00:26:04.195 line:95%,end
Don't you like his swag?

00:26:05.797 --> 00:26:07.265 line:95%,end
Do you like his dad swag?

00:26:08.767 --> 00:26:11.036 line:95%,end
Well, I think he's pretty doggone cute.

00:26:11.102 --> 00:26:12.938 line:95%,end
I think that you guys make a cute couple.


00:26:28.553 --> 00:26:31.489 line:5%,start
Oh! Look at that-
This is so exciting!

00:26:33.391 --> 00:26:35.126 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER:
It's the morning of The View,

00:26:35.193 --> 00:26:37.929 line:95%,end
and I was a little bit
nervous before I got here,

00:26:37.996 --> 00:26:40.699 line:5%,start
but now that I'm here at the studio,

00:26:40.765 --> 00:26:42.200 line:5%,start
I just can't wait to get out there.

00:26:42.267 --> 00:26:44.002 line:95%,end
OK, is that good girls?

00:26:44.069 --> 00:26:45.804 line:5%,start
You want to check it out? Check it out.

00:26:46.237 --> 00:26:48.139 line:5%,start
All right guys, places.

00:26:48.807 --> 00:26:52.077 line:95%,end
I need you not to pay attention
to anything that's going on,

00:26:52.911 --> 00:26:54.479 line:95%,end
but to me.

00:26:56.047 --> 00:26:58.083 line:95%,end
The girls are going
to perform The Last Text.

00:26:58.149 --> 00:27:01.820 line:95%,end
Putting choreography
on live TV is difficult.

00:27:02.187 --> 00:27:03.989 line:95%,end
We start out rehearsing the girls,

00:27:04.055 --> 00:27:06.625 line:95%,end
all the cameramen are there,
all the sound guys.

00:27:06.691 --> 00:27:08.026 line:95%,end
They're watching the girls.

00:27:08.093 --> 00:27:09.995 line:95%,end
They're serious about their jobs.

00:27:10.061 --> 00:27:13.665 line:95%,end
And I love being here with
all this professionalism.

00:27:13.732 --> 00:27:16.334 line:95%,end
Five, six, seven and Asia.

00:27:21.439 --> 00:27:22.607 line:95%,end
Did you see where you are?

00:27:22.674 --> 00:27:24.442 line:95%,end
Are you in line with that first pole?

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:26.511 line:95%,end
Yes.

00:27:26.578 --> 00:27:28.046 line:95%,end
You came too far downstage.

00:27:28.113 --> 00:27:30.482 line:95%,end
You know what, Asia, come out of there.

00:27:30.548 --> 00:27:33.718 line:95%,end
You go in, right now,
so she can see what you do.

00:27:34.219 --> 00:27:38.356 line:95%,end
I am swapping Asia and Mackenzie out,
in and out, in and out,

00:27:38.423 --> 00:27:40.859 line:95%,end
because I want to see who's
going to actually perform.

00:27:40.925 --> 00:27:42.961 line:5%,start
All right, Mackenzie, what happened?

00:27:43.028 --> 00:27:44.863 line:5%,start
I give you the opportunity to practice it,

00:27:44.929 --> 00:27:48.633 line:5%,start
I want to use Asia,
and now you do a cartwheel,

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:51.336 line:5%,start
you stop, then you move forward
and do a back handspring.

00:27:51.403 --> 00:27:52.470 line:5%,start
What was going on?

00:27:54.639 --> 00:27:56.408 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: Thought you were
going to fall off the stage?

00:27:56.574 --> 00:27:59.544 line:95%,end
I really want Mackenzie to do it
because she was part

00:27:59.611 --> 00:28:01.446 line:95%,end
of the original award winning number,

00:28:01.513 --> 00:28:05.850 line:95%,end
but Melissa has to learn that she
doesn't get her cake and eat it too.

00:28:06.117 --> 00:28:08.286 line:95%,end
And Asia is just raring to go.

00:28:09.387 --> 00:28:12.824 line:95%,end
Bigger, Paige. When it gets hit,
when the car hits the impact,

00:28:12.891 --> 00:28:15.493 line:95%,end
you need to levitate out of that car.

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:18.630 line:95%,end
Like if you-- if the seat
that would be holding you in,

00:28:18.697 --> 00:28:19.831 line:95%,end
you need to boom.

00:28:21.032 --> 00:28:23.768 line:95%,end
It's bigger, like that your
butt up out of the seat almost.

00:28:23.835 --> 00:28:24.669 line:95%,end
Go.

00:28:27.072 --> 00:28:28.973 line:95%,end
Paige, you're doing this.

00:28:29.841 --> 00:28:30.975 line:95%,end
The wheels there.

00:28:31.042 --> 00:28:32.043 line:95%,end
Don't, don't.

00:28:38.183 --> 00:28:39.517 line:95%,end
Bigger, sharper.

00:28:40.985 --> 00:28:42.721 line:95%,end
I'm embarrassed as a teacher.

00:28:42.787 --> 00:28:45.457 line:95%,end
I'm sitting over here
and it's like I'm humiliated.

00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:46.925 line:95%,end
I mean, come on.

00:28:46.991 --> 00:28:48.393 line:95%,end
This is The View.

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:50.028 line:95%,end
All right, let's go guys.

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:54.532 line:95%,end
KRISTI RAY: Asia's fine,
but she did practice it,

00:28:54.599 --> 00:28:57.502 line:95%,end
but you keep going back
and forth with Abby about getting

00:28:57.569 --> 00:28:58.636 line:95%,end
Kenzie in the dance, and--

00:28:58.703 --> 00:28:59.537 line:95%,end
MELISSA GISONI: Yeah, I should.

00:28:59.604 --> 00:29:00.505 line:95%,end
I'm sticking up for my kid.

00:29:00.572 --> 00:29:01.606 line:95%,end
KRISTI RAY: But I'm
sticking up for mine too.

00:29:01.673 --> 00:29:02.507 line:95%,end
That's fine.

00:29:02.574 --> 00:29:03.942 line:95%,end
KRISTI RAY: Because she's
mature enough to understand,

00:29:04.008 --> 00:29:07.612 line:95%,end
but also it keeps being
an issue in her face.

00:29:07.712 --> 00:29:10.648 line:95%,end
And then you have Jill chiming
in and everyone chiming in.

00:29:10.715 --> 00:29:11.950 line:95%,end
That is what's not fair.

00:29:12.016 --> 00:29:14.619 line:95%,end
I have Melissa here crying
about Mackenzie going on.

00:29:14.686 --> 00:29:18.623 line:5%,start
Asia is fine with whatever,
but let's just get it over with,

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:20.492 line:95%,end
and let's just say who's going on stage,

00:29:20.558 --> 00:29:23.161 line:95%,end
so I don't have the peanut gallery
here in the corner

00:29:23.328 --> 00:29:25.263 line:95%,end
talking madness on Asia.

00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:26.898 line:95%,end
CHRISTI LUKASIAK:
Didn't you already talk to Abby?

00:29:26.965 --> 00:29:27.899 line:95%,end
MELISSA GISONI: At the studio.

00:29:27.966 --> 00:29:30.769 line:95%,end
Because you were really upset,
and now you're like kind of--

00:29:30.835 --> 00:29:32.403 line:95%,end
MELISSA GISONI: I'm ti-ti-ti-ti-di.
I'm still upset.

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:33.404 line:95%,end
CHRISTI LUKASIAK: No, you're not.

00:29:33.471 --> 00:29:34.606 line:95%,end
I'm not going to do it in
front-- my kids are here,

00:29:34.672 --> 00:29:35.807 line:95%,end
Christi, and we're on The View.

00:29:35.874 --> 00:29:38.309 line:95%,end
So we're happy to be on The View, OK?

00:29:38.376 --> 00:29:39.811 line:95%,end
If Mackenzie is not it,
Mackenzie is not in it.

00:29:39.878 --> 00:29:41.513 line:95%,end
No, but I think that you know--

00:29:41.579 --> 00:29:42.714 line:95%,end
I want Mackenzie-
I do not know.

00:29:42.781 --> 00:29:44.349 line:95%,end
- CHRISTI LUKASIAK: I think you know.
- No I don't.

00:29:44.415 --> 00:29:45.483 line:95%,end
CHRISTI LUKASIAK:
I think you do know, Melissa.

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:47.519 line:95%,end
- MELISSA GISONI: I don't know.
- Why don't you ever just like--

00:29:47.585 --> 00:29:50.054 line:95%,end
MELISSA GISONI: Because I don't know
that Mackenzie is in it or not.


00:29:50.121 --> 00:29:52.457 line:95%,end
I want her in it.
She's been on this team for years.

00:29:52.524 --> 00:29:54.092 line:95%,end
CHRISTI LUKASIAK: No,
nobody's saying that.

00:29:54.159 --> 00:29:56.561 line:95%,end
What I'm calling you out on is the fact

00:29:56.628 --> 00:29:58.997 line:95%,end
that you always do stuff
behind everybody's back.

00:29:59.063 --> 00:29:59.898 line:95%,end
MELISSA GISONI: Oh, OK.

00:29:59.964 --> 00:30:00.965 line:95%,end
You do, you do.

00:30:01.032 --> 00:30:03.968 line:95%,end
She doesn't know,
and neither do I. That's what--

00:30:04.068 --> 00:30:06.971 line:95%,end
KRISTI RAY: I just wish that
you would stop going, OK,

00:30:07.038 --> 00:30:07.972 line:95%,end
Abby is Mackenzie--

00:30:08.039 --> 00:30:09.574 line:95%,end
- MELISSA GISONI: Why?
- Because she's my daughter.

00:30:09.641 --> 00:30:11.543 line:95%,end
I have to fight for my daughter.

00:30:11.609 --> 00:30:13.478 line:95%,end
KRISTI RAY: It's like this whole
big charade about this foot,

00:30:13.578 --> 00:30:15.246 line:95%,end
all I keep hearing is about
this foot, and I'm like OK--

00:30:15.313 --> 00:30:16.781 line:95%,end
MELISSA GISONI: I'm not
bringing it up. The foot's done.

00:30:16.848 --> 00:30:18.483 line:95%,end
KRISTI RAY: Let Abby pick
and be done with it.

00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:20.118 line:95%,end
Let it die.

00:30:20.785 --> 00:30:23.054 line:5%,start
HOLLY FRAZIER: Unfortunately,
Melissa dug herself a hole.

00:30:23.121 --> 00:30:25.123 line:5%,start
Melissa said from the very beginning

00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:30.662 line:5%,start
that Mackenzie was injured,
and how Melissa initially framed

00:30:30.728 --> 00:30:32.964 line:95%,end
it sounded like we didn't know
when Mackenzie was going to be

00:30:33.031 --> 00:30:34.098 line:95%,end
well enough to dance again.

00:30:34.165 --> 00:30:35.934 line:95%,end
It was like an indefinite injury.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.003 line:95%,end
I think the point is, is that
Melissa is the one who made

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:41.973 line:95%,end
such a big deal about the foot,
and she couldn't do it

00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:45.176 line:95%,end
if it was competing against
Asia in a competition.

00:30:45.243 --> 00:30:46.244 line:95%,end
Now that it's for The View,

00:30:46.311 --> 00:30:48.179 line:95%,end
all of a sudden
Mackenzie's miraculously better.

00:30:48.246 --> 00:30:50.014 line:95%,end
Oh, please.
Give me a [bleep] BREAK.

00:30:50.081 --> 00:30:51.883 line:95%,end
I wanted Mackenzie
to dance last week, Christi.

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:52.784 line:95%,end
OK.

00:30:52.851 --> 00:30:54.819 line:95%,end
It's an overuse injury, Christi, get it.

00:30:54.886 --> 00:30:56.054 line:95%,end
It's not a broken bone.

00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:57.822 line:95%,end
CHRISTI LUKASIAK: I get it,
but you're the one who made it

00:30:57.889 --> 00:30:59.090 line:95%,end
into a huge thing!

00:30:59.157 --> 00:31:01.159 line:95%,end
I mean, what else am I supposed to do?

00:31:01.492 --> 00:31:04.529 line:95%,end
I mean, I want my daughter to dance,
I'm sorry.

00:31:04.596 --> 00:31:07.131 line:95%,end
But she's, you know, she's on the team.

00:31:07.198 --> 00:31:08.833 line:95%,end
I want her to dance.

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:10.568 line:5%,start
I want Mackenzie to dance.

00:31:10.668 --> 00:31:11.936 line:5%,start
She's ready to dance.

00:31:12.003 --> 00:31:14.038 line:95%,end
When we're in our hotel room, all she does

00:31:14.105 --> 00:31:16.007 line:95%,end
is dance, and practice, and stretch.

00:31:16.074 --> 00:31:17.909 line:95%,end
She is ready.

00:31:17.976 --> 00:31:20.011 line:95%,end
KRISTI RAY: Melissa, you're
acting like a jealous mom.

00:31:20.078 --> 00:31:21.412 line:95%,end
MELISSA GISONI: No!
No, I'm just saying.

00:31:21.479 --> 00:31:22.146 line:95%,end
What was that--

00:31:22.213 --> 00:31:23.648 line:95%,end
Careful.

00:31:23.715 --> 00:31:25.016 line:95%,end
She doesn't like that it's
happening to someone else.

00:31:25.083 --> 00:31:27.819 line:95%,end
I'm trying to explain,
but you don't let me [bleep] talk.

00:31:27.886 --> 00:31:28.953 line:95%,end
I'm telling you--

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:29.954 line:95%,end
KRISTI RAY: You need to
be clearer, because--

00:31:30.021 --> 00:31:31.656 line:95%,end
MELISSA GISONI: I'm talking!

00:31:31.723 --> 00:31:32.423 line:95%,end
So I can understand you.

00:31:32.523 --> 00:31:34.192 line:95%,end
I'm not talking.

00:31:35.426 --> 00:31:36.861 line:95%,end
[cheering]

00:31:36.928 --> 00:31:38.496 line:95%,end
Kristi, look at you!

00:31:38.563 --> 00:31:39.864 line:95%,end
KRISTI RAY: Here in person, I was just--

00:31:39.931 --> 00:31:40.798 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: Fabulous.

00:31:40.865 --> 00:31:42.066 line:95%,end
KRISTI RAY: Thank you.

00:31:42.166 --> 00:31:43.902 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: I want to be
like that when I grow up.

00:31:44.569 --> 00:31:46.004 line:95%,end
She looks great.

00:31:46.337 --> 00:31:47.338 line:95%,end
Who's is going to be in the dance?

00:31:47.405 --> 00:31:51.042 line:95%,end
I'm not sure yet if Asia
or Mackenzie are doing the dance.

00:31:51.109 --> 00:31:53.511 line:95%,end
Mackenzie already got to do it,
and she's been hurt,

00:31:53.578 --> 00:31:56.447 line:95%,end
and it's, you know, I'm kind of getting

00:31:57.582 --> 00:32:01.052 line:95%,end
that she was hurt because she didn't want
to go up against Asia.

00:32:01.119 --> 00:32:03.288 line:95%,end
So I need to go,
I need to get into hair and makeup.

00:32:03.888 --> 00:32:05.290 line:95%,end
That's show business, ladies.

00:32:08.426 --> 00:32:09.394 line:95%,end
Have them ready.

00:32:09.627 --> 00:32:10.895 line:95%,end
- OK.
- OK

00:32:13.364 --> 00:32:14.532 line:95%,end
JILL VERTES: There they are!

00:32:14.599 --> 00:32:17.268 line:95%,end
The stars of the day!

00:32:17.568 --> 00:32:19.070 line:95%,end
HOLLY FRAZIER:
Abby said by the time she comes in here,

00:32:19.137 --> 00:32:22.607 line:95%,end
she wants you dressed and ready,
so be nice and warmed up.

00:32:22.674 --> 00:32:25.209 line:95%,end
For the most part, Melissa is very guarded

00:32:25.276 --> 00:32:29.247 line:95%,end
and not letting you see
how upset she is that Asia

00:32:29.547 --> 00:32:31.749 line:95%,end
is basically taking over Mackenzie's role.

00:32:31.816 --> 00:32:33.051 line:95%,end
I mean, I think there's a perception

00:32:33.117 --> 00:32:37.288 line:95%,end
that Mackenzie's space,
or her place on the team,

00:32:38.222 --> 00:32:40.058 line:95%,end
is a little threatened by Asia.

00:32:41.292 --> 00:32:43.194 line:95%,end
MELISSA GISONI: Oh, don't,
don't do that again, Kenz.

00:32:43.261 --> 00:32:44.562 line:95%,end
No more doing that, OK?

00:32:44.629 --> 00:32:45.530 line:95%,end
Just leave it.

00:32:45.596 --> 00:32:46.664 line:95%,end
KRISTI RAY: This is life.

00:32:46.731 --> 00:32:48.633 line:95%,end
It's not always fair, right?

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:51.669 line:95%,end
So, whatever she decides,
we're going to go with it.

00:32:51.736 --> 00:32:53.404 line:95%,end
If you're not in the dance,

00:32:53.471 --> 00:32:55.473 line:95%,end
You kn- I know you're mature
enough to understand.

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:57.075 line:95%,end
MELISSA GISONI: You know,
most likely you're not

00:32:57.141 --> 00:32:58.109 line:95%,end
going to be in the dance, OK?

00:32:58.176 --> 00:32:59.344 line:95%,end
So don't get upset.

00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:02.013 line:95%,end
No pouting, no crying, OK?

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:03.181 line:95%,end
KRISTI RAY: That's how it is, right?

00:33:03.247 --> 00:33:08.619 line:95%,end
OK, so, you just watch and be happy,
and hope the group just does really well.

00:33:08.686 --> 00:33:09.654 line:95%,end
If you're in it--

00:33:09.721 --> 00:33:10.822 line:95%,end
MELISSA GISONI: It is what it is.


00:33:19.197 --> 00:33:20.999 line:5%,start
PRODUCER: Sherri's going
to talk about a shout out

00:33:21.065 --> 00:33:23.034 line:5%,start
to her ex-husband, complimenting him,

00:33:23.101 --> 00:33:24.836 line:95%,end
which we talked about in Hot Topic.

00:33:24.902 --> 00:33:27.305 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: Yeah,
I get the last word there.

00:33:27.839 --> 00:33:29.207 line:95%,end
- You love that.
- I love that.

00:33:29.273 --> 00:33:30.208 line:95%,end
Postal Service fashions.

ABBY LEE MILLER: Co-hosting
The View is huge.

00:33:32.043 --> 00:33:34.946 line:5%,start
I mean, I'm a dance teacher
from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

00:33:35.013 --> 00:33:38.716 line:5%,start
And here I am dealing with
Oscar winner Whoopi Goldberg?

00:33:38.783 --> 00:33:39.951 line:95%,end
This is crazy.

00:33:40.018 --> 00:33:42.387 line:95%,end
WHOOPI GOLDBERG: Today,
our guest co-host week

00:33:42.453 --> 00:33:44.422 line:95%,end
continues with Abby Lee Miller.

00:33:44.489 --> 00:33:47.425 line:95%,end
[applause]

CHRISTI LUKASIAK:
The fake smile is killing me.

00:33:50.061 --> 00:33:51.329 line:95%,end
JILL VERTES: No, I told you.

00:33:51.396 --> 00:33:54.699 line:95%,end
I told you she would be on
her best, charming behavior.

00:33:54.766 --> 00:33:55.867 line:95%,end
CHRISTI LUKASIAK: She'll be on cloud nine.

00:33:57.902 --> 00:33:59.337 line:95%,end
WHOOPI GOLDBERG: Abby, listen to me.

00:33:59.404 --> 00:34:01.172 line:95%,end
You're thought to be a tough teacher.

00:34:01.239 --> 00:34:02.073 line:95%,end
I am tough.

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:04.942 line:95%,end
I think that there's a way to coach,
and there's a way not to coach.

00:34:05.009 --> 00:34:06.344 line:95%,end
I don't think you can necessarily

00:34:06.411 --> 00:34:10.648 line:95%,end
break a kid on field if they
feel supported at home, right?

00:34:10.982 --> 00:34:13.818 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: There's a child
and I could say, honey,

00:34:13.885 --> 00:34:17.188 line:5%,start
when your foot comes through,
so cou-de-pied into passe,

00:34:17.255 --> 00:34:20.158 line:5%,start
you need to open your hip
and tuck your derriere under.

00:34:20.224 --> 00:34:23.127 line:95%,end
One time, very nicely,
[snap], it's fixed.

00:34:23.194 --> 00:34:27.565 line:95%,end
Another kid, you have to yell at them
until you're blue in the face.

00:34:28.599 --> 00:34:29.867 line:95%,end
HOLLY FRAZIER: I'm a little surprised.

00:34:29.934 --> 00:34:33.738 line:5%,start
It seems as though that most
of the hosts really like Abby.

00:34:33.805 --> 00:34:37.375 line:5%,start
Like she has a fan club on The View.

00:34:37.575 --> 00:34:39.010 line:95%,end
All right girls, we're ready for you.

00:34:40.278 --> 00:34:43.114 line:95%,end
[excited chatting]

00:34:50.421 --> 00:34:52.090 line:95%,end
Do what you got to do.
This is your moment.

00:34:52.156 --> 00:34:53.858 line:95%,end
You're on national TV.

00:34:54.225 --> 00:34:55.927 line:95%,end
- CHRISTI LUKASIAK: Make it count.
- Make it count.

00:34:55.993 --> 00:34:57.462 line:95%,end
Millions are watching.

00:34:57.728 --> 00:34:59.564 line:5%,start
HOLLY FRAZIER: Break a leg, all of you.

00:35:00.398 --> 00:35:02.667 line:5%,start
Who's going to dance?
Asia? Mackenzie?

00:35:02.733 --> 00:35:03.901 line:5%,start
I have no idea.

00:35:03.968 --> 00:35:05.036 line:95%,end
Ready, ladies?

00:35:05.436 --> 00:35:07.171 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: Ready, girls?
Shoulders down, long necks.

00:35:07.238 --> 00:35:10.808 line:95%,end
So, Elisabeth leads, dance performance,
and then you

00:35:10.908 --> 00:35:12.410 line:95%,end
and all the hosts will come
in at the end, say goodbye.

00:35:12.477 --> 00:35:13.544 line:95%,end
The girls look great.

00:35:13.611 --> 00:35:16.447 line:95%,end
They're serious, they're acting
like seasoned professionals.

00:35:16.514 --> 00:35:17.782 line:95%,end
I'm thrilled with their behavior.

00:35:17.849 --> 00:35:18.783 line:95%,end
All right.

00:35:21.719 --> 00:35:23.387 line:95%,end
This is my decision.

00:35:24.388 --> 00:35:27.258 line:95%,end
You are going to do the number.

00:35:27.758 --> 00:35:29.827 line:95%,end
You are coming out with me at the end.

00:35:29.894 --> 00:35:31.596 line:95%,end
- ABBY LEE MILLER: Understand?
- Yes.

00:35:32.029 --> 00:35:33.531 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER:
The next time you're hurt,

00:35:34.632 --> 00:35:36.100 line:95%,end
I go to the doctor with you.

00:35:36.167 --> 00:35:37.368 line:95%,end
- Understood?
- Yes.

00:35:37.435 --> 00:35:40.071 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: Because I think
your mother is lying.

00:35:40.538 --> 00:35:41.639 line:95%,end
Let's go.

00:35:43.441 --> 00:35:45.042 line:95%,end
I put Mackenzie in The Last Text,

00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:49.847 line:95%,end
because three different times
I told Asia where she needed to fall,

00:35:49.914 --> 00:35:52.116 line:95%,end
she kept doing it wrong.

00:35:52.183 --> 00:35:54.652 line:95%,end
Wrong gets you tossed out.

00:35:54.719 --> 00:35:56.320 line:95%,end
ELISABETH HASSELBECK:
Here to perform The Last Text,

00:35:56.387 --> 00:35:59.123 line:95%,end

CHRISTI LUKASIAK: When Mackenzie
pops up from behind the seat

00:36:11.202 --> 00:36:13.938 line:5%,start
in The Last Text,
all is well in Melissa's little world.

00:36:14.005 --> 00:36:15.273 line:95%,end
Look at her foot.
You see her foot up?

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:17.975 line:95%,end
I never noticed her doing that before.

00:36:18.409 --> 00:36:20.811 line:95%,end
KRISTI RAY: Personally,
I knew this was going to happen,

00:36:20.878 --> 00:36:25.082 line:95%,end
but Abby's going to go ahead
and take loyalty over talent.

00:36:25.383 --> 00:36:26.217 line:95%,end
That's fine.

00:36:31.522 --> 00:36:33.758 line:5%,start
KELLY HYLAND: I'm not surprised
that Mackenzie ended up

00:36:33.824 --> 00:36:35.026 line:5%,start
doing this dance at all.

00:36:35.092 --> 00:36:37.728 line:5%,start
I think that Abby knew all week

00:36:37.795 --> 00:36:39.797 line:95%,end
of who she was going
to have do this dance.

00:36:42.466 --> 00:36:45.236 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:36:48.773 --> 00:36:51.809 line:5%,start
MACKENZIE ZIEGLER: As soon as
I did my cartwheel over the seat,

00:36:51.876 --> 00:36:53.678 line:5%,start
I was like, I'm back.

00:37:01.652 --> 00:37:04.255 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: Co-hosting
The View, that's a dream come true.

00:37:04.322 --> 00:37:06.791 line:95%,end
But right now,
I only have one thing on my mind,

00:37:06.857 --> 00:37:08.693 line:95%,end
and that's beating Cathy.

00:37:08.759 --> 00:37:11.262 line:95%,end
[city bustle]

00:37:12.163 --> 00:37:15.233 line:95%,end
CATHY NESBITT-STEIN: This group number
is going to be stupendous.

00:37:15.299 --> 00:37:19.136 line:95%,end
- I think that the girl that we chose--
- Yes, she was--

00:37:19.203 --> 00:37:21.739 line:95%,end
--she's going to be perfect
for what we want her to be.


00:37:21.806 --> 00:37:24.542 line:95%,end
With the fact that Abby
has seen my all boy team

00:37:24.609 --> 00:37:26.077 line:5%,start
for the past couple of competitions,

00:37:26.143 --> 00:37:29.013 line:5%,start
I think that bringing in somebody
that has the qualities

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:32.850 line:95%,end
that Victoria has is definitely
going to throw them for a loop.

00:37:32.917 --> 00:37:36.087 line:95%,end
Well, listen, you know
yesterday I had an audition.

00:37:36.153 --> 00:37:38.689 line:95%,end
So I needed somebody that
was really going to enhance you.

00:37:38.756 --> 00:37:41.225 line:95%,end
So, we found a girl.

00:37:41.292 --> 00:37:43.227 line:95%,end
You know, I like to do the unexpected

00:37:43.294 --> 00:37:44.562 line:95%,end
when it comes to Abby.

00:37:44.629 --> 00:37:47.231 line:95%,end
She's going to think
because of last time

00:37:47.298 --> 00:37:50.201 line:95%,end
when we did so amazing that we're
going to have all boys.

00:37:50.268 --> 00:37:53.904 line:95%,end
So now we bring in this girl that she
doesn't know who the girl is.

00:37:53.971 --> 00:37:56.073 line:95%,end
- Hi
- ALL: Oh.

00:37:57.375 --> 00:37:59.110 line:95%,end
Wow!

00:37:59.176 --> 00:38:00.878 line:95%,end
- RICK TESTERMAN: Are you tough?
- Oh, yeah!

00:38:00.945 --> 00:38:02.680 line:95%,end
Because you've got to be
tough to be on this team.

00:38:02.747 --> 00:38:04.215 line:95%,end
We don't take no mess.

00:38:04.282 --> 00:38:05.883 line:95%,end
CATHY NESBITT-STEIN:
They're expecting the all boys,

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:08.185 line:95%,end
and here we're going to come in
with this beautiful girl,

00:38:08.252 --> 00:38:11.022 line:95%,end
who is not only beautiful,
but a great dancer.

00:38:11.088 --> 00:38:12.890 line:5%,start
And and it's probably
going to rock their world.

00:38:13.758 --> 00:38:15.059 line:5%,start
ANTHONY BURRELL: And you, unfold.

00:38:15.126 --> 00:38:16.360 line:5%,start
You, unfold.

00:38:16.427 --> 00:38:17.862 line:95%,end
You, unfold.

00:38:17.928 --> 00:38:19.163 line:95%,end
You, unfold.

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:21.499 line:95%,end
Six, seven and a eight.

00:38:22.333 --> 00:38:23.434 line:95%,end
ANTHONY BURRELL: Lay back, Brandon.

00:38:23.501 --> 00:38:24.535 line:95%,end
Put your head on her.

00:38:24.602 --> 00:38:26.504 line:95%,end
CATHY NESBITT-STEIN: The Day of the Dead
happens after Halloween,

00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:28.706 line:95%,end
and it's a Mexican holiday.

00:38:28.773 --> 00:38:33.210 line:95%,end
And it's a very jubilant time
with lots of garish face painting,

00:38:33.277 --> 00:38:35.813 line:95%,end
lots of over-the-top costuming.

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:38.382 line:95%,end
So I think that this theme
is a good thing for us,

00:38:38.449 --> 00:38:41.152 line:95%,end
and it's going to be a lot
of fun to take to the stage.

00:38:41.218 --> 00:38:43.287 line:95%,end
So guys I don't think it was clear.

00:38:43.354 --> 00:38:46.424 line:95%,end
It's like Zack is pushing it,
you're going like this.

00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:49.593 line:95%,end
Five, six, then you're
doing seven and a eight.

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:51.662 line:95%,end
OK? That wasn't completely clear.

00:38:51.729 --> 00:38:53.664 line:95%,end
It is clear. You just got to open
your mind and brains,

00:38:53.731 --> 00:38:54.799 line:95%,end
and stop being so closed-minded.

00:38:54.865 --> 00:38:55.866 line:95%,end
CATHY NESBITT-STEIN: Easy.

00:38:55.933 --> 00:38:58.469 line:95%,end
Six, seven, eight and--

00:38:58.536 --> 00:39:01.105 line:95%,end
CATHY NESBITT-STEIN: Victoria's
a technically sound dancer

00:39:01.172 --> 00:39:04.141 line:95%,end
and she's very pliable with the boys.

00:39:04.208 --> 00:39:07.778 line:95%,end
The boys are having a very easy time
with her in partnering.

00:39:07.845 --> 00:39:09.613 line:95%,end
How are you feeling, Victoria?
Comfortable? Good.

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:12.283 line:95%,end
Boys, it's a match!

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:13.818 line:95%,end
It's match made in heaven.

00:39:18.956 --> 00:39:20.725 line:95%,end
- ABBY LEE MILLER: Hey hey.
- Hi.

00:39:20.791 --> 00:39:21.625 line:95%,end
JILL VERTES: There she is.

00:39:21.692 --> 00:39:23.127 line:95%,end
- ABBY LEE MILLER: Hello!
- Good job.

00:39:23.194 --> 00:39:25.129 line:95%,end
Oh, and you're all in a good mood
because Mackenzie danced.

00:39:25.196 --> 00:39:26.263 line:95%,end
- And I told her--
- MELISSA GISONI: Yes, thank you.

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:28.332 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: -- the next time
either one of your kids go to the doctor,

00:39:28.399 --> 00:39:31.135 line:95%,end
I'm going, because I think
you're lying to me.

00:39:31.202 --> 00:39:32.236 line:95%,end
I'm not.

00:39:32.303 --> 00:39:34.238 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: Well, that's just--
I'm just saying.

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:38.909 line:95%,end
MOMS: Oh, hey!

00:39:41.312 --> 00:39:43.381 line:95%,end
Good job, you guys--

00:39:43.447 --> 00:39:46.450 line:95%,end
[indistinct chatter]

00:39:46.517 --> 00:39:48.052 line:95%,end
-- did she tell you not to listen to me?

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:50.388 line:95%,end
Go tell Abby.

00:39:50.454 --> 00:39:52.590 line:95%,end
You tired? I see somebody yawning.

00:39:52.656 --> 00:39:54.392 line:95%,end
- MACKENZIE ZIEGLER: No, I'm not tired.
- Everyboby's up since four.

00:39:55.426 --> 00:39:56.460 line:95%,end
I've been up since 6:05.

00:39:56.527 --> 00:39:57.928 line:95%,end
KENDALL VERTES: Of course
Asia's not tired.

00:39:57.995 --> 00:39:58.929 line:95%,end
I'm never tired.

00:39:58.996 --> 00:40:00.064 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: She isn't.

00:40:00.131 --> 00:40:01.165 line:95%,end
She's ready to go.

00:40:01.365 --> 00:40:03.734 line:95%,end
There's nothing wrong with
a little healthy competition.

00:40:04.402 --> 00:40:06.670 line:95%,end
Yes, you should want to turn like Asia,

00:40:07.271 --> 00:40:10.374 line:95%,end
and you should want to do your
acro tricks like Mackenzie.

00:40:10.841 --> 00:40:13.144 line:95%,end
That's the way it has to be, you know?

00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:16.347 line:95%,end
She just got off being
in a major competition show.

00:40:17.014 --> 00:40:19.417 line:95%,end
And she lives in California,
there's a million opportunities for her

00:40:19.683 --> 00:40:20.518 line:95%,end
to do.

00:40:20.584 --> 00:40:22.787 line:95%,end
So you need to learn from that,
and take that.

00:40:22.853 --> 00:40:24.021 line:95%,end
- Yes?
- Yes.

00:40:24.088 --> 00:40:26.390 line:95%,end
She's a very mature seven-year-old.

00:40:26.457 --> 00:40:29.760 line:95%,end
All right girls,
great part of the day, but it's over.

00:40:30.661 --> 00:40:33.597 line:95%,end
It's another thing on your resume,
excellent.

00:40:33.697 --> 00:40:37.368 line:95%,end
But now, we need to concentrate
on the competition this weekend.

00:40:38.602 --> 00:40:42.072 line:95%,end
Let's get focused, get ready,
review what you had yesterday

00:40:42.139 --> 00:40:43.240 line:95%,end
so you're ready to go on.

00:40:43.307 --> 00:40:45.509 line:95%,end
I told you before,
I'm not going backwards.

00:40:45.576 --> 00:40:47.878 line:95%,end
I'm not correcting things
you learned yesterday.

00:40:47.945 --> 00:40:48.946 line:95%,end
We need to move ahead.

00:40:56.153 --> 00:40:57.388 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER (VOICEOVER):
Next on Dance Moms.

00:40:57.455 --> 00:40:59.623 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: Do not
embarrass me with Cathy.

00:40:59.723 --> 00:41:01.158 line:5%,start
Do not embarrass me in New York.

00:41:01.225 --> 00:41:02.893 line:5%,start
KRISTI RAY: Look at me
when you talk to me.

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:04.395 line:5%,start
CHRISTI LUKASIAK: I'm looking
you in the eye, bitch.

00:41:04.462 --> 00:41:05.463 line:5%,start
Bitch? Let's go.

00:41:05.529 --> 00:41:06.864 line:5%,start
Step out of my face. I have a kid--

00:41:06.931 --> 00:41:08.098 line:5%,start
You want to see me in your face?

00:41:08.165 --> 00:41:10.768 line:5%,start
He has anger issues
and he better stay away from us.

00:41:10.835 --> 00:41:12.369 line:5%,start
Kick you right in the [bleep] [bleep]...

00:41:12.436 --> 00:41:14.205 line:5%,start
What the hell's wrong with you?
Crazy.

00:41:14.271 --> 00:41:16.974 line:5%,start
CATHY NESBITT-STEIN: And you know what?
You're going to go down every week.

00:41:17.041 --> 00:41:18.209 line:5%,start
ABBY LEE MILLER:
You were ripping on Paige.

00:41:18.275 --> 00:41:19.810 line:5%,start
You said she should give it up
and go model.

00:41:19.877 --> 00:41:20.711 line:5%,start
I heard it.

00:41:20.778 --> 00:41:22.580 line:5%,start
KELLY HYLAND: You're not her dance teacher
so don't give her critique. (CRYING)

00:41:22.646 --> 00:41:26.717 line:5%,start
You humiliated her in front
of an entire [bleep] audience.
