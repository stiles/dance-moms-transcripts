[music playing] Previously
on "Dance Moms"--

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:04.404 line:5%,start
- I just want Kelly back.
- I know.

00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:05.472 line:5%,start
That's the plan.

00:00:05.538 --> 00:00:07.073 line:5%,start
Girls, where are you?

00:00:07.707 --> 00:00:09.976 line:5%,start
I'm going to replace the entire team.

00:00:10.377 --> 00:00:11.611 line:5%,start
Melissa, this is Abby.

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:15.782 line:5%,start
You are losing your mind
if you're gonna jeopardize

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:16.983 line:5%,start
Maddie and Mackenzie.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.818 line:5%,start
They're replacing our kids.

00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:20.587 line:5%,start
Well, welcome!

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:23.189 line:5%,start
- Thank you.
- My new Maddie-- I'm thrilled.

00:00:23.256 --> 00:00:24.824 line:5%,start
MELISSA: Sofia is on top of the pyramid,

00:00:24.891 --> 00:00:26.393 line:5%,start
and she's not even here.

00:00:26.459 --> 00:00:30.797 line:5%,start
ABBY: My next routine
will be a duet with Maddie and Kendall.

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:32.665 line:5%,start
ABBY (VOICEOVER):
Coming up on "Dance Moms"--

00:00:32.732 --> 00:00:35.969 line:5%,start
I want to make sure that
you're all aware your replacements

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:37.170 line:5%,start
will be at the competition.

00:00:37.237 --> 00:00:38.805 line:5%,start
GLORIA: They really
like making fun of our kids.

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:40.440 line:5%,start
[laughs] ABBY: Sorry.

00:00:40.507 --> 00:00:42.909 line:5%,start
Could you quit running up
to the mirror so close?

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:44.010 line:5%,start
Think!

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:45.912 line:5%,start
Mackenzie forgets her dance on stage.

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:46.980 line:5%,start
She goes completely blank.

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:48.748 line:5%,start
MELISSA: You now what? You risked--

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:51.785 line:5%,start
- My daughter is special.
- ABBY: --your kids on Paige and Brooke.

00:00:51.851 --> 00:00:53.119 line:5%,start
You know we all make mistakes, Abby.

00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:54.754 line:5%,start
ABBY: We love you.

00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:57.891 line:5%,start
We were ready to work with you
and you sat out there!

00:00:57.957 --> 00:00:59.793 line:5%,start
I'm sorry.

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:01.594 line:5%,start
That was hurtful!

00:01:01.661 --> 00:01:03.496 line:95%,end
[theme music]

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:04.998 line:95%,end
(SINGING) Get up!

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:07.434 line:95%,end
Get on the floor.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.807 line:95%,end
My world is with my girls,
living on the dance floor.

00:01:13.873 --> 00:01:16.576 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:20.647 line:5%,start
GIANNA: Hey, Ab, Devin
just called the studio.

00:01:20.713 --> 00:01:23.016 line:95%,end
Oh, from the competition?
What did he want?

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:24.717 line:95%,end
He just left a message. I don't know.

00:01:24.784 --> 00:01:28.088 line:95%,end
Hi Devin, this is Abby from
the Abby Lee Dance Company. How are you?

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:31.291 line:5%,start
ABBY: Good.
I just wanted to return your call.

00:01:31.357 --> 00:01:34.527 line:95%,end
Gianna had said that you called,
and I wanted to thank you.

00:01:51.744 --> 00:01:53.980 line:95%,end
All right.
Well, thank you so much for calling.

00:01:56.015 --> 00:01:58.218 line:95%,end
- How about that?
- So they didn't win.

00:01:58.384 --> 00:02:01.688 line:95%,end
- They did not win.
- Well, Kendall just had a rough weekend.

00:02:01.754 --> 00:02:05.158 line:5%,start
Last week at Dance Troupe
Challenge at Greensboro,

00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:06.559 line:95%,end
Kendall and Maddie won it all.

00:02:06.626 --> 00:02:09.596 line:95%,end
ANNOUNCER: Number 217, "Sugar and Spice,"

00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:11.397 line:95%,end
Abby Lee Dance Company!

00:02:11.464 --> 00:02:12.332 line:95%,end
[cheering and applause]

00:02:12.398 --> 00:02:15.368 line:95%,end
ABBY: Turns out there was an
error in the calculations,

00:02:15.435 --> 00:02:17.403 line:95%,end
and they were second.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.073 line:95%,end
And we all know what second is--

00:02:20.673 --> 00:02:22.742 line:95%,end
the biggest loser on the stage.

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:25.645 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:02:31.451 --> 00:02:34.921 line:95%,end
Well, once again, I'm not very happy.

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:36.422 line:95%,end
When I left that competition,

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.326 line:95%,end
everybody was gloating about
how amazing you were, the big winners.

00:02:40.393 --> 00:02:41.861 line:95%,end
Nothing blew me away.

00:02:41.928 --> 00:02:45.131 line:95%,end
I think all of you would
be interested in knowing

00:02:45.198 --> 00:02:48.401 line:95%,end
that our duet,
"Sugar and Spice," did not win.

00:02:50.937 --> 00:02:53.106 line:95%,end
There was a mathematical error.

00:02:53.706 --> 00:02:56.576 line:95%,end
And that means that "Sugar and Spice,"
Maddie and Kendall,

00:02:56.643 --> 00:02:59.179 line:95%,end
were not the overall
high score winning duet/trio.

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:01.314 line:95%,end
So Greensboro, North Carolina,

00:03:01.381 --> 00:03:03.483 line:95%,end
which we thought was a smashing success,

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:04.784 line:95%,end
turned out to be a big letdown.

00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:06.786 line:95%,end
JILL: Abby couldn't wait
to come in and tell us

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:10.123 line:5%,start
that Kendall and Maddie
did not get first place.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.625 line:95%,end
And I think Abby reveled in that.

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:14.093 line:95%,end
I watched the group number.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.998 line:95%,end
I saw some superb dancing
and I saw some horrendous dancing.

00:03:19.065 --> 00:03:21.501 line:95%,end
Kendall, whose place did you take?

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:23.703 line:5%,start
ABBY: Sophia's.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.872 line:95%,end
Did you look like she would
have looked doing that number?

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.476 line:95%,end
You don't know? I'll tell you. No way.


00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:31.945 line:95%,end
Sophia is still in LA.

00:03:32.011 --> 00:03:33.279 line:95%,end
She's there with her mom.

00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:34.480 line:95%,end
She's doing television.

00:03:34.547 --> 00:03:36.149 line:95%,end
She's doing performances.

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:38.284 line:95%,end
So I need the girls to step
it up in Sophia's absence,

00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:39.652 line:95%,end
and they're just not doing it.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.189 line:95%,end
Listen to me. Learn this,
every single one of you--

00:03:43.256 --> 00:03:46.459 line:95%,end
when you're in here rehearsing
and you keep screwing up,

00:03:46.526 --> 00:03:51.631 line:95%,end
you don't need me to stand there
and point out every mistake.

00:03:51.698 --> 00:03:52.999 line:95%,end
Can't you see it?

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.501 line:95%,end
If you don't want to be a better dancer,

00:03:55.568 --> 00:03:57.170 line:95%,end
I'm not going to waste my breath on you.

00:03:57.237 --> 00:04:00.273 line:95%,end
I want to worry about the kid
who wants to be a star,

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.876 line:95%,end
not the kid that's here just so she gets
invited to all the birthday parties.

00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:08.047 line:95%,end
Kendall, you worked
your way up that pyramid

00:04:08.114 --> 00:04:10.049 line:95%,end
and now you're right back
where you started from.

00:04:11.684 --> 00:04:13.286 line:95%,end
Next, Maddie.

00:04:13.353 --> 00:04:15.688 line:95%,end
All for one, one for all,
it's about the team.

00:04:15.755 --> 00:04:17.290 line:95%,end
Kendall's there, you went with her.

00:04:19.025 --> 00:04:21.127 line:95%,end
Nia, you did an OK job.

00:04:21.194 --> 00:04:22.996 line:95%,end
I just don't see
the feet getting any better.

00:04:24.797 --> 00:04:29.002 line:95%,end
Moving up, Paige,
you placed in the top five.

00:04:29.068 --> 00:04:30.069 line:95%,end
That's an improvement.

00:04:30.436 --> 00:04:31.304 line:95%,end
Next,

00:04:33.072 --> 00:04:36.276 line:95%,end
Chloe, I thought you really
stood out starting the group dance.

00:04:36.342 --> 00:04:37.844 line:95%,end
Was the group fabulous?

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.847 line:95%,end
No. I think if your mother
was more honest with you,

00:04:40.913 --> 00:04:45.718 line:95%,end
like she used to be two or three years
ago, you would continue to improve.

00:04:46.019 --> 00:04:49.055 line:95%,end
And on top of the pyramid is Mackenzie.

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:50.923 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:54.327 line:95%,end
It's like you bumped
your sister right down there.

00:04:54.394 --> 00:04:55.728 line:95%,end
Does it feel good to be up there?

00:04:55.795 --> 00:04:56.796 line:95%,end
Well, guess what?

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.032 line:95%,end
You are back in the group routine.

00:04:59.098 --> 00:05:02.201 line:95%,end
If you could go against 9-year-olds
and win,

00:05:02.268 --> 00:05:03.903 line:95%,end
then you can dance with a 9-year-old.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.772 line:95%,end
I was the big winner last week,

00:05:05.838 --> 00:05:08.174 line:95%,end
so Abby put me on the top of the pyramid.

00:05:08.241 --> 00:05:10.076 line:5%,start
Pressure's on.

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:13.880 line:95%,end
This weekend we will be
traveling to In10sity Dance

00:05:13.946 --> 00:05:15.581 line:95%,end
in Woodbridge, Virginia.

00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:18.184 line:95%,end
Your replacements
will be at the competition,

00:05:18.251 --> 00:05:20.186 line:95%,end
along with the rest of their studio.

00:05:20.253 --> 00:05:22.422 line:95%,end
When the moms walked out of my studio,

00:05:23.222 --> 00:05:24.590 line:95%,end
I replaced their kids.

00:05:24.657 --> 00:05:25.591 line:95%,end
That's what you do.

00:05:26.025 --> 00:05:28.594 line:95%,end
Two of those replacements,
Kaeli and Bella,

00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:32.065 line:95%,end
are going to be attending the
dance competition this weekend.

00:05:32.131 --> 00:05:35.034 line:95%,end
And I'm sure that they want nothing more

00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:37.437 line:95%,end
than to beat my team.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.205 line:95%,end
Mackenzie, you have a solo.

00:05:39.272 --> 00:05:41.974 line:95%,end
Not only are you
in this week's group routine,

00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:44.777 line:95%,end
but you are going to be featured
in the number, as well.

00:05:44.844 --> 00:05:48.514 line:95%,end
That's because this week we
are doing an acrobatic routine.

00:05:49.148 --> 00:05:51.351 line:95%,end
Chloe, I know acrobatics
is not your forte,

00:05:51.517 --> 00:05:52.919 line:95%,end
but your mom has stood at that desk

00:05:52.985 --> 00:05:56.756 line:95%,end
and told me on several occasions
that you have your standing back tuck.

00:05:56.823 --> 00:05:58.391 line:95%,end
So that's how the number
is going to start.

00:05:58.458 --> 00:06:00.193 line:95%,end
- Oh, no. Chloe is not doing a standing--
- ABBY: You're going

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:01.260 line:95%,end
- to set your tuck.
- Oh, yes, she is.

00:06:01.327 --> 00:06:02.628 line:95%,end
- CHRISTI: No, Abby. I refuse.
- ABBY: Yup.

00:06:02.695 --> 00:06:05.298 line:95%,end
No. Abby, she does not
have permission to do that.

00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:08.134 line:95%,end
- You just said that she had it.
- I said that months ago.

00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:09.736 line:95%,end
Right, so it should be better.

00:06:09.802 --> 00:06:11.804 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Abby telling Chloe
that she's starting the group dance

00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:13.673 line:5%,start
with a standing back
tuck really sets me off.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.776 line:5%,start
Because Abby knows that Chloe
is not confident in the standing

00:06:16.843 --> 00:06:19.178 line:95%,end
back tuck, so she's really
just setting her up to fail.

00:06:19.245 --> 00:06:21.314 line:95%,end
Chloe, do you think
you're confident enough?

00:06:22.081 --> 00:06:23.282 line:95%,end
Be honest, Chloe.

00:06:23.816 --> 00:06:25.151 line:95%,end
ABBY: Well, why would
you come and tell me your kid

00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:26.319 line:95%,end
- could do a back tuck?
- Because she--

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:27.987 line:95%,end
When parents come and tell me things,

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:29.689 line:95%,end
it's because they want me
to work it into the number.

00:06:29.756 --> 00:06:31.657 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: No. Chloe, you are not
doing it in the routine.

00:06:31.724 --> 00:06:34.127 line:95%,end
You know she is afraid
of gymnastics tricks.

00:06:34.193 --> 00:06:36.028 line:95%,end
She is not allowed to do it.

00:06:36.095 --> 00:06:39.031 line:95%,end
You know what? You had Paige do a standing
back in that dressing room

00:06:39.098 --> 00:06:40.299 line:95%,end
- and she broke her foot.
- No, I didn't!

00:06:40.366 --> 00:06:41.267 line:95%,end
Yes, you did!

00:06:41.334 --> 00:06:43.536 line:95%,end
I want to see your standing back tuck.

00:06:43.603 --> 00:06:45.071 line:95%,end
Can I try it?

00:06:45.138 --> 00:06:47.173 line:95%,end
ABBY: No. This is cement
underneath this carpeting.

00:06:47.573 --> 00:06:49.175 line:95%,end
[crunch]

00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:51.611 line:95%,end
You said, "I want to see
that standing back tuck."

00:06:51.677 --> 00:06:53.613 line:95%,end
Chloe, you are not
doing it in the routine.

00:06:53.679 --> 00:06:54.981 line:95%,end
KELLY: But the more we sit here and argue,

00:06:55.047 --> 00:06:57.049 line:95%,end
- the more they're not practicing.
- ABBY: I'm not arguing.

00:06:57.116 --> 00:06:59.886 line:95%,end
I invited a child to do a trick
that her mother said she could do.

00:06:59.952 --> 00:07:02.155 line:95%,end
Chloe, you were supposed
to do a solo this week.


00:07:02.221 --> 00:07:04.824 line:95%,end
But after the performance
your mother just gave,

00:07:04.891 --> 00:07:06.325 line:95%,end
we're going to hold off on that.

00:07:06.392 --> 00:07:07.326 line:95%,end
OK.

00:07:07.393 --> 00:07:09.128 line:95%,end
All right, girls, spread apart.

00:07:09.195 --> 00:07:10.863 line:95%,end
Mothers, you are dismissed.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.367 line:95%,end
Maybe you want to sit and really watch
upstairs instead of being on your phones.

00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:17.870 line:5%,start
Five, six, seven, eight--

00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:19.038 line:5%,start
I don't even get it.

00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:20.606 line:5%,start
ABBY: One, two--

00:07:21.307 --> 00:07:22.308 line:5%,start
GIANNA: Switch.

00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:25.044 line:95%,end
ABBY: The name of the group
routine is "Arabian Nights."

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:28.848 line:95%,end
It's a contortion, acrobatic,
gymnastic, tumbling routine.

00:07:28.915 --> 00:07:30.216 line:95%,end
Jump up.

00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:31.751 line:95%,end
You got to jump your feet together.

00:07:31.818 --> 00:07:35.221 line:95%,end
It has it all, complete
with the authentic hands.

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:37.390 line:95%,end
It has to be sharp, boom.

00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:40.159 line:95%,end
Do you think that I was wrong
for standing up for Chloe?

00:07:40.226 --> 00:07:41.093 line:95%,end
HOLLY: I don't think you're wrong, at all.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.429 line:95%,end
I just think that you fell
right into Abby's trap.

00:07:43.496 --> 00:07:45.198 line:95%,end
ABBY: One, two--

00:07:45.264 --> 00:07:48.234 line:95%,end
KELLY: I think this Arabian dance
will be a challenge for Paige

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:51.037 line:95%,end
because Abby always
is yelling at her for her arms.

00:07:51.103 --> 00:07:52.705 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Well, it's gonna
be a challenge for Chloe.

00:07:52.772 --> 00:07:55.174 line:95%,end
Because out of the group,
she's not-- A gymnast.

00:07:55.241 --> 00:07:56.442 line:95%,end
--a gymnast or an acrobat.

00:07:58.211 --> 00:08:00.513 line:95%,end
Paige, your elbows are lazy.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.114 line:95%,end
First time I'm telling you.

00:08:02.181 --> 00:08:03.416 line:95%,end
Let it be the last.

00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:05.251 line:95%,end
So do you think
that really bothers Maddie,

00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:08.221 line:95%,end
that Kenzie has all these solos
and is the lead?

00:08:08.287 --> 00:08:09.755 line:95%,end
I mean, that's usually Maddie's spot.

00:08:09.822 --> 00:08:12.258 line:95%,end
Yeah, but Maddie
it's not jealous of her sister.

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:14.093 line:95%,end
She's proud of her.
But she gets stressed out.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.196 line:95%,end
Melissa, I suggested that
you get some of Christi's spunk

00:08:17.263 --> 00:08:18.865 line:95%,end
that she had at pyramid.

00:08:18.931 --> 00:08:20.600 line:95%,end
I just don't know how you can sit there,

00:08:20.666 --> 00:08:23.369 line:95%,end
like, and not say anything.

00:08:23.436 --> 00:08:26.706 line:95%,end
It's been a few weeks and Maddie
still hasn't had a solo.

00:08:26.772 --> 00:08:30.643 line:95%,end
It's hard. But, you know,
she knows she'll get one eventually.

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:32.378 line:95%,end
Well, I'm going to talk to Abby.

00:08:32.445 --> 00:08:33.579 line:95%,end
[gasps] You are?

00:08:33.646 --> 00:08:35.481 line:95%,end
- Mm-hmm. Yeah, after--
- HOLLY: Good.

00:08:35.548 --> 00:08:37.283 line:95%,end
- About what?
- After rehearsal.

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:38.885 line:95%,end
I'm proud of you. That's good.

00:08:38.951 --> 00:08:40.753 line:95%,end
I'm letting you all go. You are dismissed.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.321 line:95%,end
Go through that door.

00:08:42.388 --> 00:08:44.790 line:95%,end
Ab, can I talk to you
for a sec before you leave?

00:08:44.857 --> 00:08:45.958 line:95%,end
ABBY: Yeah. What?

00:08:46.025 --> 00:08:50.963 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I really would love for Maddie
to prove to you that she can win.

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:52.131 line:95%,end
- I know, Melissa.
- MELISSA: And, you know--

00:08:52.198 --> 00:08:55.568 line:95%,end
But you have to realize that she was just
in a duet with Kendall.

00:08:55.635 --> 00:08:57.603 line:95%,end
And even though she was
a lot better than Kendall

00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:59.972 line:95%,end
and a lot stronger,
she didn't blow me away, either.

00:09:00.039 --> 00:09:02.508 line:95%,end
She is special.
And my daughter wants to dance.

00:09:02.575 --> 00:09:03.743 line:95%,end
ABBY: I know,
but why am I telling you that?

00:09:03.809 --> 00:09:07.613 line:95%,end
Why wouldn't the kid
that had the potential to make it,

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.549 line:95%,end
to have a career in this business,

00:09:09.615 --> 00:09:13.252 line:95%,end
not have her own integrity,
her own ambition--

00:09:13.319 --> 00:09:15.021 line:95%,end
MELISSA: She wanted to come in.
--to get out of the car and walk in?

00:09:15.087 --> 00:09:16.756 line:95%,end
- She wanted to come. You're not--
- Then why didn't you-- why--

00:09:16.822 --> 00:09:18.324 line:95%,end
what kind of parent were you
to not let her?

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:20.560 line:95%,end
If you're doing this for Kelly,
you're a fool.

00:09:20.726 --> 00:09:21.994 line:95%,end
Don't do this to your kid.

00:09:22.061 --> 00:09:23.563 line:95%,end
I've been committed to the studio.

00:09:23.629 --> 00:09:25.498 line:95%,end
But your daughter
has been given opportunity

00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:26.966 line:95%,end
- after opportunity--
- And I realize that.

00:09:27.033 --> 00:09:28.701 line:95%,end
- ABBY: --after opportunity.
- And I appreciate that.

00:09:28.768 --> 00:09:30.002 line:95%,end
I have sent her to New York for auditions.

00:09:30.069 --> 00:09:31.971 line:95%,end
- And she's gone every time.
- ABBY: I took her to LA.

00:09:32.038 --> 00:09:33.472 line:95%,end
I do all of these things, Melissa--

00:09:33.539 --> 00:09:35.975 line:95%,end
- And I know that.
- --and I called you.

00:09:36.042 --> 00:09:37.643 line:95%,end
- I know you did.
- ABBY: I called you.

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:39.111 line:95%,end
I didn't call every one of those mothers.

00:09:39.178 --> 00:09:40.246 line:95%,end
- You--
- MELISSA: You know what?

00:09:40.313 --> 00:09:42.715 line:95%,end
- My daughter is special.
- --risked your kids--

00:09:42.782 --> 00:09:45.451 line:95%,end
special-- on Paige and Brooke.

00:09:45.518 --> 00:09:48.955 line:95%,end
I would have never picked up the phone
and called Sophia

00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:51.190 line:95%,end
if Maddie would have been
in this building working her butt off.

00:09:51.257 --> 00:09:52.658 line:95%,end
Well, you know,
we all make mistakes, Abby.

00:09:52.725 --> 00:09:54.327 line:95%,end
- I've been committed to this studio.
- Yeah, but what you did--

00:09:54.393 --> 00:09:56.395 line:95%,end
-- you hurt your own kid.
You didn't hurt me.

00:09:56.462 --> 00:09:58.064 line:95%,end
I-- I realize that, Abby.

00:09:58.130 --> 00:09:59.832 line:95%,end
No solo this weekend.

00:09:59.899 --> 00:10:01.300 line:95%,end
There is no way, Melissa.

00:10:01.467 --> 00:10:03.369 line:95%,end
You did this to Maddie, not me.

00:10:03.436 --> 00:10:05.871 line:95%,end
Well, I'm not going to worry about it.

00:10:05.938 --> 00:10:06.973 line:95%,end
Come on, let's go.

00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:08.674 line:95%,end
Get dressed, Mad.

00:10:08.741 --> 00:10:09.775 line:95%,end
Get your shoes on.

00:10:09.842 --> 00:10:11.844 line:95%,end
Who's going to have
the other solo this week?

00:10:11.911 --> 00:10:14.947 line:95%,end
Well, Melissa just asked me
if Maddie could do a solo.

00:10:15.014 --> 00:10:16.382 line:95%,end
- After that deal?
- GIANNA: No.

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:17.450 line:5%,start
- ABBY: No way.
- GIANNA: No.

00:10:18.985 --> 00:10:20.052 line:95%,end
And now she wants a solo?

00:10:20.119 --> 00:10:21.554 line:95%,end
And now she wants a solo.

00:10:22.755 --> 00:10:23.956 line:95%,end
- MADDIE: (CRYING)
- MELISSA: It's OK.

00:10:24.023 --> 00:10:25.057 line:95%,end
MADDIE: I just really want to do one.

00:10:25.124 --> 00:10:26.359 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I know. You work hard, Maddie.

00:10:26.425 --> 00:10:29.095 line:95%,end
You don't miss classes.
You're a good girl. OK?


00:10:32.231 --> 00:10:34.033 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.435 line:5%,start
ABBY: Now you all realize that
we had to put an extra class

00:10:36.502 --> 00:10:40.339 line:5%,start
in the schedule because we're doing
an acrobatic routine this week.

00:10:40.406 --> 00:10:44.210 line:5%,start
So let's spread apart
and let's do some drills, quickly.

00:10:44.276 --> 00:10:48.247 line:5%,start
We teach acrobatics gymnastics
at our studio every single day.

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:50.916 line:5%,start
But I feel the kids need an extra class

00:10:50.983 --> 00:10:54.186 line:95%,end
just to go through the tricks that
I'm gonna use in the routine.

00:10:54.253 --> 00:10:56.422 line:95%,end
Little better, little tighter.

00:10:56.489 --> 00:10:59.091 line:95%,end
GIANNA: Ready? Five, six--

00:10:59.158 --> 00:11:01.060 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: The group
dance this week is acrobatic.

00:11:01.127 --> 00:11:05.598 line:5%,start
And that makes me a little nervous
because acro is not Chloe's forte.

00:11:07.266 --> 00:11:09.702 line:95%,end
ABBY: OK. She would not be one
of the ones. Go ahead.

00:11:13.272 --> 00:11:14.573 line:95%,end
She's the one whose mother thinks

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:15.941 line:95%,end
she can do the back tuck.

00:11:16.008 --> 00:11:17.309 line:95%,end
You're so crooked.

00:11:17.376 --> 00:11:19.679 line:95%,end
You're so-- all got alignment
from that left split

00:11:19.845 --> 00:11:22.214 line:95%,end
comes out in everything you do.

00:11:23.416 --> 00:11:24.517 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Why is Chloe crying?

00:11:24.984 --> 00:11:26.419 line:95%,end
'Cause Abby's awful to her.

00:11:26.485 --> 00:11:28.921 line:95%,end
Wouldn't you like
one free punch at Abby's face?

00:11:29.555 --> 00:11:33.292 line:95%,end
You know what? She's not happy unless
she's humiliating someone.

00:11:33.359 --> 00:11:35.294 line:95%,end
Chloe struggles in acrobatic class.

00:11:35.594 --> 00:11:37.329 line:95%,end
She's not flexible for acrobatics

00:11:37.396 --> 00:11:39.298 line:95%,end
and she's not strong for gymnastics.

00:11:39.632 --> 00:11:41.901 line:95%,end
But if I put a standing
back tuck in this routine,

00:11:41.967 --> 00:11:43.903 line:95%,end
everybody has to do it.

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:45.604 line:95%,end
Put the mats away.

00:11:45.671 --> 00:11:46.772 line:95%,end
Any news on the solos?

00:11:46.839 --> 00:11:48.641 line:95%,end
- I think Chloe has one.
- JILL: Anybody?

00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:50.476 line:95%,end
- Chloe has a solo?
- CHRISTI: No.

00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:52.311 line:95%,end
- Not as far as I know.
- Didn't she learn one today?

00:11:52.378 --> 00:11:53.446 line:95%,end
KELLY: Well, was supposed
to at pyramid, but then--

00:11:53.512 --> 00:11:54.680 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Well, she was supposed to.

00:11:54.747 --> 00:11:56.182 line:95%,end
JILL: When you asked her
yesterday for a solo,

00:11:56.248 --> 00:11:57.383 line:95%,end
what did Abby say?

00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:59.652 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Oh, she just kept ranting,
"I gave your daughter

00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:04.090 line:95%,end
all these opportunities," and I'm like,
I did a lot for you through these years.

00:12:04.156 --> 00:12:05.691 line:95%,end
She says we're ungrateful.
And ungrateful--

00:12:05.758 --> 00:12:07.159 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: That's being ungrateful.

00:12:07.226 --> 00:12:08.627 line:95%,end
- She's ungrateful.
- Right.

00:12:08.694 --> 00:12:10.563 line:95%,end
Well, Melissa, I'm glad you stuck with us
in the parking lot.

00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:11.497 line:95%,end
Because I know that was hard--

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:12.398 line:95%,end
- Me, too.
- --for you to do.

00:12:12.465 --> 00:12:13.299 line:95%,end
HOLLY: I am, too.

00:12:13.365 --> 00:12:14.967 line:95%,end
And don't regret what you did.

00:12:15.034 --> 00:12:18.537 line:95%,end
A true friend would not be treating
you this way or your children.

00:12:21.407 --> 00:12:23.743 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I know Abby is still angry at me

00:12:23.809 --> 00:12:26.045 line:5%,start
for walking out on her
during the silent protest.

00:12:26.112 --> 00:12:28.147 line:95%,end
And now Maddie's suffering from it.

00:12:28.214 --> 00:12:30.549 line:95%,end
I'm really beginning to wonder
if I made the right decision

00:12:30.616 --> 00:12:31.851 line:95%,end
walking out with the moms.

00:12:31.917 --> 00:12:33.586 line:95%,end
ABBY: Five, six, seven, go.

00:12:33.652 --> 00:12:36.055 line:95%,end
[screams] What are you two doing?

00:12:36.122 --> 00:12:37.790 line:95%,end
Uh-oh.
Kenzie's crying Uh-oh.

00:12:37.857 --> 00:12:38.791 line:95%,end
- What happened?
- What happened?

00:12:38.858 --> 00:12:40.025 line:95%,end
ABBY: What's going on?

00:12:43.562 --> 00:12:46.065 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Mackenz-- Mackenz, are you OK?

00:12:46.132 --> 00:12:47.700 line:95%,end
All right. Go get a drink.
Come on.

00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:50.736 line:95%,end
I find it funny
that Melissa feels upset, mad.

00:12:50.803 --> 00:12:52.705 line:95%,end
My kid's always a backup dancer

00:12:52.772 --> 00:12:54.373 line:95%,end
and my kid never gets a solo.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.408 line:5%,start
Melissa and Maddie are making
such a big deal out of it

00:12:56.475 --> 00:12:57.643 line:5%,start
that they don't have a solo.

00:12:57.710 --> 00:13:00.913 line:95%,end
Well, like, welcome to my life,
my kids' life.

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:02.782 line:95%,end
Melissa and Maddie can't stand it

00:13:02.948 --> 00:13:04.617 line:95%,end
that Maddie's is not the star.

00:13:04.683 --> 00:13:06.585 line:95%,end
I am fortunate that Chloe has solos often.

00:13:06.652 --> 00:13:09.388 line:95%,end
But you guys have gone
months, some of you.

00:13:09.455 --> 00:13:11.690 line:95%,end
One of the moms, when I was leaving here
last night,

00:13:11.757 --> 00:13:12.892 line:95%,end
grabbed me in the parking lot.

00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:16.929 line:95%,end
She said Melissa's really
second guessing her choice

Melissa keeps saying
"Abby has ruined Maddie,

00:13:21.267 --> 00:13:23.102 line:95%,end
you know, I shouldn't have done it."

00:13:23.169 --> 00:13:24.470 line:95%,end
- That's done.
- CHRISTI: Nobody twisted her arm

00:13:24.537 --> 00:13:26.739 line:95%,end
and said you need to stick by us.

00:13:26.806 --> 00:13:28.374 line:95%,end
- She chose to do that.
- HOLLY: Yeah.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.475 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Sometimes it's more important

00:13:29.542 --> 00:13:31.410 line:95%,end
to teach your daughter
to do the right thing

00:13:31.477 --> 00:13:33.913 line:95%,end
than to be on top of a pyramid
and get a solo.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:35.548 line:95%,end
"Arabian Nights"


00:13:37.616 --> 00:13:39.852 line:95%,end
better too well.

00:13:39.919 --> 00:13:42.021 line:95%,end
You are dismissed. I want to talk to you.

00:13:43.289 --> 00:13:45.224 line:95%,end
Chloe looks like she wants to throw up.

00:13:45.724 --> 00:13:47.026 line:95%,end
ABBY: Come here, Chloe.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.629 line:95%,end
I don't think you deserve a solo,
not the way your mother

00:13:50.696 --> 00:13:52.464 line:95%,end
speaks to me in the pyramid.

00:13:53.766 --> 00:13:56.969 line:95%,end
I want what's best for you as my dancer.

00:13:57.036 --> 00:13:58.170 line:95%,end
What am I going to do?

00:13:58.237 --> 00:14:00.039 line:95%,end
I'm in between a rock and a hard place.

00:14:00.673 --> 00:14:02.775 line:95%,end
Chloe, I'm giving you your solo back.

00:14:03.142 --> 00:14:04.610 line:95%,end
It's what time?

00:14:04.677 --> 00:14:07.079 line:95%,end
And we have one day,
and now I'm going to start it.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.682 line:95%,end
We could have been
finished with your solo.

00:14:09.748 --> 00:14:11.250 line:95%,end
It could be done by now.

00:14:11.884 --> 00:14:12.818 line:5%,start
Let's go.

00:14:12.885 --> 00:14:16.355 line:5%,start
Now the theme of the dance is haunted.

00:14:16.522 --> 00:14:17.823 line:95%,end
It's scary.

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:19.191 line:95%,end
It's dark.

00:14:19.258 --> 00:14:22.494 line:95%,end
And the movement is similar
to what we just did in the group dance.

00:14:22.561 --> 00:14:23.395 line:95%,end
Understood?

00:14:23.462 --> 00:14:26.565 line:95%,end
Five, six, step across, seven.

00:14:26.632 --> 00:14:30.870 line:95%,end
Chloe is doing a lyrical
contemporary piece entitled "Haunted."

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:34.440 line:95%,end
Chloe really has to be an actress
to pull off this routine.

00:14:34.506 --> 00:14:37.109 line:95%,end
She needs to be a haunted character.

00:14:37.176 --> 00:14:41.247 line:95%,end
The best way to think about that
is by thinking of her mother.

00:14:42.381 --> 00:14:44.750 line:95%,end
Down, cross, passÃ©.

00:14:45.184 --> 00:14:46.852 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I love watching Chloe dance.

00:14:46.919 --> 00:14:49.088 line:95%,end
And I think that every time
Chloe steps on stage

00:14:49.154 --> 00:14:50.456 line:95%,end
it helps make her a better dancer.

00:14:50.556 --> 00:14:53.392 line:95%,end
So I was really glad that Abby
finally, you know, bucked up

00:14:53.492 --> 00:14:55.027 line:95%,end
and was the grown up about it and said,

00:14:55.094 --> 00:14:56.362 line:95%,end
"Hey, Chloe you earned this.

00:14:56.428 --> 00:14:58.664 line:95%,end
"It's yours, regardless
of what your mother did."

00:14:58.864 --> 00:15:00.232 line:95%,end
ABBY: Right. Really beautiful leg.

00:15:00.299 --> 00:15:02.668 line:95%,end
Get that leg up and wing that foot.

00:15:02.735 --> 00:15:07.473 line:95%,end
And, Chloe, it's not OK to make your
own thing up and just keep going.

00:15:07.773 --> 00:15:10.643 line:95%,end
That is unacceptable now.
That was for a little kid.

00:15:10.709 --> 00:15:13.212 line:95%,end
I will see you tomorrow morning
ready to get on that bus.

00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:15.047 line:95%,end
And I want perfection.

00:15:17.716 --> 00:15:20.519 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:15:23.756 --> 00:15:24.924 line:95%,end
Maddie, I want to talk to you.

00:15:26.558 --> 00:15:29.128 line:95%,end
MADDIE: Miss Abby brought me into Studio C

00:15:29.194 --> 00:15:32.197 line:95%,end
and wanted to have a talk with me.

00:15:32.264 --> 00:15:36.702 line:5%,start
I just wanted Miss Abby to understand
that, like, I love to dance,

00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:39.939 line:95%,end
and I think I want it
more than anyone else.

00:15:40.706 --> 00:15:42.374 line:95%,end
What's going on?

00:15:42.441 --> 00:15:44.243 line:95%,end
Why were you in your car
last night crying?

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:47.379 line:95%,end
I was crying because I was just going

00:15:47.446 --> 00:15:49.982 line:95%,end
to ask you I could have a solo.

00:15:50.049 --> 00:15:51.350 line:95%,end
I just, like, am--

00:15:51.417 --> 00:15:53.585 line:95%,end
feel like this is, like, my home and--

00:15:53.652 --> 00:15:54.987 line:95%,end
Uh-uh.

00:15:56.422 --> 00:16:01.293 line:95%,end
Every opportunity I have given you
came from my heart.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.095 line:95%,end
Maddie won how many titles?

00:16:03.762 --> 00:16:06.231 line:95%,end
How many times was she on the top
of that pyramid?

00:16:06.298 --> 00:16:08.701 line:95%,end
Girls, come on. I want to get going
for the pyramid.

00:16:08.767 --> 00:16:09.601 line:95%,end
Where are you?

00:16:09.668 --> 00:16:11.403 line:95%,end
There's people standing
in the parking lot.

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:13.138 line:95%,end
That was awful, Maddie.

00:16:13.205 --> 00:16:14.440 line:95%,end
I don't deserve that.

00:16:14.506 --> 00:16:15.908 line:95%,end
I didn't deserve any of it.

00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:17.443 line:95%,end
There's always another kid.

00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:19.011 line:95%,end
There's always somebody else.

00:16:19.078 --> 00:16:20.446 line:95%,end
We love you.

00:16:20.512 --> 00:16:23.649 line:95%,end
We were ready to work with you,
and you sat out there!

00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:28.620 line:95%,end
(CRYING) I'm sorry.

00:16:28.687 --> 00:16:30.356 line:95%,end
Why didn't you get out of the car

00:16:30.422 --> 00:16:33.759 line:95%,end
and go, no, I'm going in there?

00:16:34.093 --> 00:16:35.995 line:95%,end
I'm sorry.

00:16:36.161 --> 00:16:37.463 line:95%,end
Maddie, no solo.

00:16:37.529 --> 00:16:38.764 line:95%,end
Think about what you've done.

00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:40.632 line:95%,end
It's going to take a long time.

Mackenzie, you have one day, today.

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:50.376 line:5%,start
You have right now to fix this dance
before we start the group rehearsal,

00:16:50.442 --> 00:16:51.877 line:5%,start
and you're competing tomorrow.

00:16:51.944 --> 00:16:55.581 line:5%,start
Brain in the head focused on nothing
but this right now.

00:16:55.647 --> 00:16:56.949 line:5%,start
Turn around.

Mackenzie is doing a contemporary
acrobatic routine

00:17:02.988 --> 00:17:04.490 line:95%,end
called "Dancing Barefoot."

00:17:04.623 --> 00:17:06.458 line:5%,start
She is used to going out on that stage

00:17:06.525 --> 00:17:09.828 line:5%,start
and smiling and making
her cute little faces.

00:17:09.895 --> 00:17:11.597 line:95%,end
Feet are sickled right there.

00:17:11.663 --> 00:17:14.967 line:95%,end
Go on your side and fix that. Fix it.
Yes.

00:17:15.034 --> 00:17:17.403 line:95%,end
Well, you know what? She's eight now.

00:17:17.469 --> 00:17:19.805 line:95%,end
I wanna see beautiful lines.

I wanna see real choreography.

I want to see her tell a story.

00:17:24.843 --> 00:17:26.812 line:95%,end
Maddie was able to do it
when she was eight.

00:17:26.879 --> 00:17:29.314 line:95%,end
Up, up, down, down, jetÃ©, push, roll.

00:17:29.381 --> 00:17:32.651 line:95%,end
Roll. Sloppy feet, rolling around.
Step up.

All right. I need to know
more about Studio Bleu.

00:17:35.521 --> 00:17:37.022 line:95%,end
Well, Abby sure is enamored by them.

00:17:37.089 --> 00:17:38.657 line:95%,end
What are they known for, do you know?

00:17:38.724 --> 00:17:40.492 line:95%,end
Well, that's why I'm looking.

00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:42.795 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Although I know
the competition will have

00:17:42.861 --> 00:17:45.864 line:5%,start
more than one dance studio there,

00:17:45.931 --> 00:17:47.933 line:5%,start
the only one that Abby
cares about at this moment

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.301 line:95%,end
- is Studio Bleu.
- Yeah.

00:17:49.368 --> 00:17:50.636 line:95%,end
- I'm looking under--
- JILL: Where are they located?

00:17:50.702 --> 00:17:52.337 line:95%,end
Well, they're in Ashburn, Virginia.

00:17:52.404 --> 00:17:54.373 line:95%,end
JILL: They'll probably
have amazing costumes

00:17:54.573 --> 00:17:56.208 line:95%,end
and amazing number,
and they probably

00:17:56.275 --> 00:17:57.609 line:95%,end
did it in nationals last year--

00:17:57.676 --> 00:17:59.812 line:95%,end
- Uh-huh.
- JILL: --and didn't whip it up.

00:17:59.878 --> 00:18:01.713 line:95%,end
And they're probably
coming out to beat our butts.

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:04.216 line:95%,end
ABBY: Three, four, five--

00:18:04.283 --> 00:18:06.985 line:95%,end
you did it again.
You're moving your right hand.

00:18:07.052 --> 00:18:08.320 line:95%,end
Didn't you get home late?

00:18:08.387 --> 00:18:10.089 line:95%,end
We got home so late last night.

00:18:10.255 --> 00:18:13.058 line:95%,end
I got home later because Maddie talked
to Abby last night.

00:18:13.125 --> 00:18:14.526 line:95%,end
JILL: What happened?

00:18:14.593 --> 00:18:16.895 line:95%,end
Her and Abby talked and Abby cried.

00:18:16.962 --> 00:18:18.163 line:95%,end
JILL: Why would Abby cry?

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:19.798 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Because that
Maddie was crying and saying,

00:18:19.865 --> 00:18:22.167 line:95%,end
you know, you're mad at me
for something my mother did

00:18:22.234 --> 00:18:24.736 line:95%,end
and you do-- you know,
basically she does it to all the kids.

00:18:24.803 --> 00:18:27.539 line:95%,end
Abby said, I love you and Gia loves you.

00:18:27.606 --> 00:18:29.875 line:95%,end
And, you know,
we were just really disappointed

00:18:29.942 --> 00:18:31.577 line:95%,end
in your mom and the decision she made.

00:18:31.643 --> 00:18:32.644 line:95%,end
And--

00:18:32.711 --> 00:18:34.913 line:95%,end
Isn't that a difference
in the conversation?

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:37.549 line:95%,end
Because she sat there
and cried and had a nice moment

00:18:37.616 --> 00:18:39.384 line:95%,end
with your daughter, where my daughter

00:18:39.451 --> 00:18:41.453 line:95%,end
as she sat there last night, same thing,

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.255 line:95%,end
and pretty much told her
that she was a piece of garbage

00:18:43.322 --> 00:18:45.124 line:95%,end
and didn't deserve to have anything.

00:18:45.991 --> 00:18:47.126 line:95%,end
I mean, I'm glad for you.

00:18:47.192 --> 00:18:48.861 line:95%,end
That's great, like,
that your kids are loved.

00:18:48.927 --> 00:18:51.530 line:95%,end

up to the mirror so close?

Don't get so close so that you're tumbling
into the stool!

00:20:31.897 --> 00:20:34.800 line:95%,end
Talent prevails.

00:20:34.866 --> 00:20:36.501 line:95%,end
I'm anxious to see their legs and feet,

00:20:36.568 --> 00:20:37.869 line:95%,end
and see how much they've improved

00:20:37.936 --> 00:20:39.671 line:95%,end
with my tricks of the trade.


00:20:39.738 --> 00:20:42.541 line:95%,end
But why would you give another
studio your tricks and trades?

00:20:42.608 --> 00:20:44.009 line:95%,end
ABBY: Because you quit, Kelly.

00:20:44.076 --> 00:20:45.510 line:95%,end
Your kids were sitting at home.

00:20:45.577 --> 00:20:47.479 line:95%,end
They weren't in the studio.

00:20:47.546 --> 00:20:50.182 line:95%,end
Mackenzie, you're my first one up.
All right?

00:20:50.249 --> 00:20:51.483 line:95%,end
You cannot miss a trick.

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:53.051 line:95%,end
Understood?

00:20:53.118 --> 00:20:55.120 line:95%,end
You have to nail every single trick.

00:20:55.187 --> 00:20:57.089 line:95%,end
If the legs aren't straight
and the feet aren't pointed,

00:20:57.222 --> 00:21:00.158 line:95%,end
you're not gonna win. Go through it.

00:21:00.425 --> 00:21:03.395 line:95%,end
The pressure is on you. You won last week.

00:21:03.462 --> 00:21:06.498 line:95%,end
And I say it every time,
you know, getting to the top is one thing.

00:21:06.565 --> 00:21:08.867 line:95%,end
Staying there is another thing.

00:21:08.934 --> 00:21:11.036 line:95%,end
Mackenzie looks beautiful.

00:21:11.103 --> 00:21:14.106 line:95%,end
That turquoise costume
certainly looks like the beach.

00:21:14.606 --> 00:21:18.677 line:95%,end
But the kid has this look on her face
like she is scared to death.

00:21:18.744 --> 00:21:20.145 line:95%,end
Hey, come on, Mackenzie.

00:21:20.212 --> 00:21:22.581 line:95%,end
Now, remember, the pressure is on.

00:21:22.648 --> 00:21:24.683 line:95%,end
I'm counting on you to win this division.

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:27.219 line:95%,end
Don't mess it up, kiddo.
Got it?

00:21:27.719 --> 00:21:29.421 line:95%,end
You're not serious enough, Mackenzie.

00:21:29.488 --> 00:21:30.989 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I'm a little
nervous for Mackenzie

00:21:31.056 --> 00:21:32.557 line:95%,end
to have this type of solo.

00:21:32.624 --> 00:21:34.226 line:5%,start
She can be a real cutesy on stage,

00:21:34.293 --> 00:21:37.729 line:5%,start
but this type of emotion
is different for her.

00:21:37.796 --> 00:21:39.064 line:95%,end
Let's go.

I'm freaking out that
I'm going to forget my solo.

just a little bit in your program

in the Mini Solo Division,

00:21:58.250 --> 00:22:01.520 line:95%,end

(SINGING) I drove out
to the ocean to catch a breath.

Everybody needs to get away.

00:22:26.845 --> 00:22:31.650 line:95%,end
Far from all commotion to clear my head,

00:22:31.717 --> 00:22:36.254 line:95%,end
where I can relax
and take a break.

00:22:36.321 --> 00:22:40.659 line:95%,end
And it's so nice to feel
the sand between my toes,

00:22:40.726 --> 00:22:44.162 line:95%,end
soaking in the sun, letting go.

00:22:44.363 --> 00:22:45.697 line:95%,end
[cheering and applause]

00:22:45.764 --> 00:22:50.669 line:95%,end
(SINGING) And I've got time
to think about important things.

00:22:50.736 --> 00:22:52.571 line:95%,end
ABBY (VOICEOVER): Mackenzie
forgets her dance on stage.

00:22:53.472 --> 00:22:54.639 line:95%,end
Keep going.

00:22:54.706 --> 00:22:56.641 line:95%,end
Keep going. Keep going.

00:22:56.708 --> 00:22:59.945 line:95%,end
There's a one split second
where she goes completely blank.

00:23:00.011 --> 00:23:03.949 line:95%,end
(SINGING) Oh, oh, oh, yeah.

00:23:04.015 --> 00:23:08.487 line:95%,end
Oh, oh, oh, yeah.

00:23:08.787 --> 00:23:11.590 line:95%,end
[cheering and applause]

00:23:12.824 --> 00:23:16.161 line:5%,start
ABBY: The end-- she was early,
so she had to add another chin

00:23:16.228 --> 00:23:19.231 line:95%,end
stand in and ends up finishing
facing the wrong direction.

00:23:19.297 --> 00:23:21.600 line:95%,end
Dumb mistake, Mackenzie. Dumb mistake.

00:23:21.867 --> 00:23:23.835 line:95%,end
- You OK?
- Oh, yeah. I'm fine.

00:23:24.302 --> 00:23:26.438 line:95%,end
- What are you going to do?
- Yeah, you're right.

00:23:26.505 --> 00:23:27.606 line:95%,end
MELISSA: She's not Maddie.

00:23:27.672 --> 00:23:29.541 line:95%,end
- She what?
- MELISSA: She is not Maddie.

00:23:29.608 --> 00:23:31.276 line:95%,end
Hello!

00:23:31.343 --> 00:23:33.145 line:95%,end
Good job, Kenz!

00:23:34.212 --> 00:23:36.314 line:95%,end
Mackenzie, how do you feel like you did?

00:23:39.918 --> 00:23:43.588 line:95%,end
Mackenzie actually danced against eight
and nine-year-olds this week,

00:23:43.655 --> 00:23:47.492 line:95%,end
so I just don't think she was ready
for this type of dance.

00:23:47.559 --> 00:23:50.295 line:95%,end
ABBY: Well, well, well, get on stage
and forget your dance.

00:23:50.362 --> 00:23:51.997 line:95%,end
Looked like a deer in the headlights.

00:23:52.063 --> 00:23:53.665 line:95%,end
You were like this.

00:23:55.033 --> 00:23:57.235 line:95%,end
So, Mackenzie, let's get through
what all you did wrong.

00:23:59.004 --> 00:24:00.372 line:95%,end
You choreographed your own
dance at the end,

00:24:00.439 --> 00:24:01.573 line:95%,end
which I don't really appreciate.

00:24:02.607 --> 00:24:04.209 line:95%,end
You were early on the music.

00:24:04.276 --> 00:24:05.644 line:95%,end
You know, I don't wanna be mean.

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:06.812 line:95%,end
I don't wanna be nasty.

00:24:06.878 --> 00:24:08.380 line:95%,end
I would have loved to walked in here

00:24:08.447 --> 00:24:11.316 line:95%,end
and had you run and hug me
and be so thrilled

00:24:11.383 --> 00:24:14.252 line:95%,end
with your performance,
but that's not what you do.

00:24:14.319 --> 00:24:17.155 line:95%,end
You were gonna be the overall
high score, eight and under,

00:24:17.222 --> 00:24:19.024 line:95%,end
go out there and do what you did.

00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:20.725 line:95%,end
You went out, you screwed up, you failed.

00:24:20.792 --> 00:24:22.294 line:95%,end
And you know what?

00:24:23.094 --> 00:24:24.663 line:95%,end
She's not ready to do a big girl dance.

00:24:24.729 --> 00:24:28.533 line:95%,end
I don't know what religion you all are,
but I'd start praying.

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.368 line:95%,end
Because that's all we have left.

when you step out on the stage

00:24:41.546 --> 00:24:43.014 line:95%,end
we should have goose bumps. All right.

"Oh, you know, it's OK."
But I want Chloe to win.

I really want her to go out there

00:24:55.193 --> 00:24:59.898 line:95%,end

she is a force to be reckoned with.

OK.

you're now up against.

You're very tall.

Yeah. I'm confused why they had to ask
their moms how old they were.

00:25:46.044 --> 00:25:48.213 line:95%,end
They just had birthdays.
I think they're just a little-

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:49.514 line:95%,end
Because they compete at different ages.

They compete different ages.

00:25:56.788 --> 00:25:58.990 line:95%,end
I was just wondering
because we have problems with people

00:25:59.057 --> 00:26:00.392 line:95%,end

00:26:01.893 --> 00:26:03.695 line:95%,end
We run into these Studio
Bleu dancers in the hall,

00:26:03.762 --> 00:26:05.997 line:95%,end

"Oh, tell them how old you are."

And the kids are like, how old am I?

00:26:07.899 --> 00:26:10.001 line:95%,end
Like, how do you not know how old you are?

00:26:10.068 --> 00:26:11.269 line:95%,end

ABBY: Kaeli is an incredible dancer.


00:28:55.233 --> 00:28:57.202 line:95%,end
She's strong, yet graceful.

00:28:57.268 --> 00:29:02.507 line:5%,start
She has lovely lines, and she can turn
like nobody's business.

00:29:02.574 --> 00:29:04.542 line:5%,start
CHLOE I'm a little bit
nervous before my solo

00:29:04.609 --> 00:29:06.978 line:5%,start
because I don't really like it
when Miss Abby gets back

00:29:07.045 --> 00:29:09.180 line:5%,start
because she gets really loud
and kind of scary.

00:29:09.247 --> 00:29:12.884 line:95%,end
ANNOUNCER: All right. Coming to the stage
next in the Junior Solo Division,

Chloe, with "Haunted."

(SINGING) They say you're doing well.

00:29:30.034 --> 00:29:32.804 line:95%,end
You're doing just fine.

00:29:32.871 --> 00:29:35.240 line:95%,end
I hear it all the time.

00:29:37.408 --> 00:29:42.547 line:95%,end
Although I give a smile,
I can't help but feel

00:29:43.014 --> 00:29:46.050 line:95%,end
like I've been left behind.

00:29:46.117 --> 00:29:52.023 line:95%,end
Oh, I'm hearing these stories
of your new found glory.

00:29:52.157 --> 00:29:56.528 line:95%,end
And I can't help but crumble inside.

00:29:56.594 --> 00:30:02.000 line:95%,end
And I thought it'd get easier,
but it's getting harder.

00:30:02.066 --> 00:30:07.205 line:95%,end
It's getting harder to hide.

00:30:07.505 --> 00:30:10.441 line:95%,end
[cheering and applause]

00:30:10.508 --> 00:30:14.145 line:95%,end
(SINGING) I'll get you
when I close my eyes.

Oh, baby, you're climbing
while I'm falling.

00:30:19.684 --> 00:30:23.021 line:95%,end
When I wake up, wake up, wake up,

00:30:23.154 --> 00:30:27.892 line:95%,end
I just fall back to the start.

00:30:27.959 --> 00:30:30.528 line:95%,end
[cheering and applause]

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:34.199 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: When Chloe dances from the heart,

00:30:35.033 --> 00:30:36.100 line:95%,end
it's such a difference.

00:30:36.167 --> 00:30:38.269 line:95%,end
And I don't think that
she connected with this piece.

00:30:38.369 --> 00:30:39.470 line:95%,end
I think she did really well.

00:30:39.537 --> 00:30:43.074 line:95%,end
I think she hit her turns,
but it wasn't quite

00:30:44.008 --> 00:30:47.145 line:95%,end
what I know Chloe can do.
I thought she danced really well,

00:30:47.212 --> 00:30:49.113 line:95%,end
but I thought she danced
better in the studio.

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:50.582 line:95%,end
I'm not gonna lie, I did.

00:30:50.648 --> 00:30:52.317 line:95%,end
I thought-- but I think
they're always better in the studio.

00:30:52.717 --> 00:30:54.352 line:95%,end
- I don't know.
- [cheering]

00:30:54.419 --> 00:30:56.421 line:95%,end
Good job!

00:30:57.755 --> 00:30:58.957 line:95%,end
You did good.

00:31:01.826 --> 00:31:03.528 line:95%,end
ABBY: What did you think
of Chloe's performance?

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:09.133 line:95%,end
I thought it was good.
And I-- I was very honest with Chloe.

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.802 line:95%,end
I thought she did it better in the studio.

00:31:12.403 --> 00:31:13.905 line:95%,end
I know Chloe can be great.

00:31:13.972 --> 00:31:15.173 line:95%,end
I've seen her be great.

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:16.608 line:95%,end
Well, we need to get back to being great.

00:31:16.674 --> 00:31:18.509 line:95%,end
I-- I realize that,
and that's what I said to her.

00:31:18.576 --> 00:31:20.645 line:95%,end
And I'm sorry, Kelly, if this offends you.

00:31:20.712 --> 00:31:27.151 line:95%,end
But Chloe's future can't be at the expense
of your two kids.

00:31:27.218 --> 00:31:29.254 line:95%,end
Melissa, you can tell
all the other moms about it.

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:30.188 line:95%,end
Right?

00:31:30.255 --> 00:31:31.489 line:95%,end
MELISSA: You know,
sometimes people make mistakes.

00:31:31.556 --> 00:31:32.891 line:95%,end
And you make mistakes, Abby, too.

00:31:32.957 --> 00:31:34.325 line:95%,end
- I've made lots of mistakes.
- OK.

00:31:34.392 --> 00:31:35.226 line:95%,end
So have I.

00:31:35.293 --> 00:31:37.028 line:95%,end
You are more worried
about your friendships

00:31:37.095 --> 00:31:39.397 line:95%,end
with all these women than your own kids,
and you know it.

00:31:39.464 --> 00:31:40.531 line:95%,end
- MELISSA: My kids-- no.
- ABBY: The same thing

00:31:40.698 --> 00:31:41.933 line:95%,end
about worrying about a guy

00:31:42.033 --> 00:31:43.201 line:95%,end
instead of your own kids.

00:31:43.268 --> 00:31:44.535 line:95%,end
Yes.

00:31:44.602 --> 00:31:45.637 line:95%,end
MELISSA: My kids come first to me.

00:31:45.703 --> 00:31:47.338 line:95%,end
- Going from one husband to another--
- So?

00:31:47.438 --> 00:31:49.574 line:95%,end
--instead of just worrying
about your kids? Please.

00:31:49.641 --> 00:31:51.142 line:95%,end
MELISSA: We have
a happy household.

00:31:51.209 --> 00:31:53.144 line:95%,end
Well, your kid
doesn't look very happy to me.

00:31:53.211 --> 00:31:54.345 line:95%,end
- Really?
- Absolutely.

00:31:54.412 --> 00:31:57.148 line:95%,end
ABBY: I think
Sophia Lucia rocked her world.

00:31:57.215 --> 00:31:59.817 line:95%,end
One more thing-- all of you kids,
you need to listen up.

00:31:59.884 --> 00:32:03.454 line:95%,end
If one person really has the dreams
and the passion

00:32:03.521 --> 00:32:04.822 line:95%,end
- to do this for a living--
- Stop.

00:32:04.889 --> 00:32:06.758 line:95%,end
- Keep it together.
- ABBY: --nothing should get in their way.

00:32:06.824 --> 00:32:08.559 line:95%,end
Melissa, listen to what I'm saying.

00:32:08.626 --> 00:32:10.328 line:95%,end
- I'm hearing you.
- Nothing should get in their way--

00:32:10.395 --> 00:32:12.063 line:95%,end
- And I know.
- --not your personal life--

00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:13.464 line:95%,end
I don't have a personal life.

00:32:13.531 --> 00:32:15.800 line:95%,end
ABBY: --not their dad's personal life,
not some other kid.

00:32:15.867 --> 00:32:17.802 line:95%,end
It has nothing to do with that.

00:32:17.869 --> 00:32:19.170 line:95%,end
Maddie needs to focus.

00:32:19.237 --> 00:32:20.638 line:95%,end
- The dance studio--
- MELISSA: I know.

00:32:20.705 --> 00:32:23.875 line:95%,end
--is the place that she thinks of as home.

00:32:23.942 --> 00:32:25.009 line:95%,end
I know that.

00:32:25.076 --> 00:32:26.277 line:95%,end
And you ripped her out of there

00:32:26.344 --> 00:32:28.579 line:95%,end
and let her sit in the parking lot
for 12 hours.

00:32:28.646 --> 00:32:30.081 line:95%,end
I feel sorry for Maddie.

00:32:30.148 --> 00:32:31.683 line:95%,end
She had a good thing going.

00:32:31.749 --> 00:32:35.286 line:95%,end
Melissa, you're doing
your kid an injustice.

00:32:36.621 --> 00:32:39.390 line:95%,end
I am not gonna sit in a dressing room

00:32:39.457 --> 00:32:42.060 line:95%,end
with a bunch of kids and a bunch
of disrespectful mothers.

00:32:42.126 --> 00:32:44.595 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:32:44.662 --> 00:32:47.699 line:5%,start
Abby just took some things
out on Maddie instead of me,

00:32:47.765 --> 00:32:50.335 line:5%,start
and it's just her way of getting to me.

00:32:50.401 --> 00:32:51.936 line:95%,end
Stop. Stop, now.

00:32:52.737 --> 00:32:54.572 line:95%,end
Do you know what? It's OK to cry, though.

00:32:54.639 --> 00:32:55.873 line:95%,end
No, because she has all this makeup on.

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:57.342 line:95%,end
- It's not OK to cry.
- Well, but I mean, it's OK to let it out.

00:32:57.408 --> 00:32:58.810 line:95%,end
- MELISSA: Because there's no reason.
- JILL: She's upset.

00:32:58.876 --> 00:33:02.213 line:95%,end
That woman just berated her mother,
her father, everybody.

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:04.282 line:95%,end
You know what? You should be upset, too.

00:33:04.349 --> 00:33:05.883 line:95%,end
And you should have
put a stop to that woman

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:07.018 line:95%,end
- saying that stuff.
- MELISSA: Do you know what?

00:33:07.085 --> 00:33:08.386 line:95%,end
It is what it is. I have a wonderful life.

00:33:08.453 --> 00:33:09.721 line:95%,end
You let her do that to you.

00:33:09.787 --> 00:33:12.790 line:95%,end
- I'm not gonna upset my child.
- She already upset her for you!

It's obvious
Abby's not coming back in here.

We're in the dressing room
getting ready to go on stage,

00:33:23.935 --> 00:33:25.536 line:5%,start

run the dance with them.

CHRISTI: OK, girls.

00:33:26.671 --> 00:33:27.905 line:95%,end
If you're dressed, get over here.

KELLY: Christi was running
the dance with them.

00:33:29.874 --> 00:33:32.243 line:95%,end
Christi never took
a dance lesson on her life.

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:34.379 line:95%,end
And Abby expects us
to go out there and get first?

CHRISTI: Beautiful feet, girls.

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:38.616 line:5%,start
I might not be a dance teacher,
but I've watched enough dance

00:33:38.683 --> 00:33:41.452 line:5%,start
in my life to know what looks good
and what looks bad.

00:33:41.519 --> 00:33:43.888 line:95%,end
Straight legs. Straight legs, all of you.

00:33:43.955 --> 00:33:45.423 line:95%,end
100 times better.

I thought it was outstanding.

00:34:50.788 --> 00:34:52.356 line:95%,end
They did it with grace.

00:34:52.423 --> 00:34:55.693 line:95%,end
This dance was an advanced routine.

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.662 line:5%,start
I think it's important that we beat them

00:34:57.728 --> 00:35:01.199 line:5%,start
because Miss Abby always says
your replacements are better than you.

00:35:01.265 --> 00:35:03.901 line:95%,end

ABBY: Just imagine
if Chloe worked over the break,

00:37:17.935 --> 00:37:20.838 line:5%,start
if she had her mother being nice and sweet


00:37:20.905 --> 00:37:22.273 line:95%,end
and paying her bills on time.

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:24.008 line:95%,end
Chloe would have been first.

00:37:24.075 --> 00:37:26.010 line:95%,end
Chloe would be amazing.

00:37:26.077 --> 00:37:30.014 line:95%,end

HOLLY: This is incredibly humbling.

00:38:05.249 --> 00:38:08.819 line:95%,end
Like, we have not come in fourth since--

00:38:08.886 --> 00:38:10.755 line:95%,end
I can't even remember.

00:38:10.821 --> 00:38:14.091 line:95%,end

ABBY: Talk about a horrible weekend--

00:38:41.819 --> 00:38:44.555 line:95%,end
talk about a bad experience--
ugh, that was it.

00:38:44.622 --> 00:38:45.923 line:95%,end
I don't know what to say.

00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:47.024 line:95%,end
It was humiliating.

00:38:47.291 --> 00:38:49.126 line:95%,end
I was humbled by the experience.

00:38:49.627 --> 00:38:51.095 line:95%,end
- CHRISTI: Hey, girl!
- KELLY: Good job!

00:38:51.162 --> 00:38:53.664 line:95%,end

[music playing]

00:38:56.167 --> 00:38:57.935 line:95%,end
ABBY: National champions to fourth--

00:38:58.002 --> 00:38:59.403 line:95%,end
you just proved my point.

00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:04.075 line:95%,end
The break, the parking lot,
the work ethic--

00:39:04.141 --> 00:39:08.045 line:95%,end
went from national champions
against amazing dancers

00:39:08.112 --> 00:39:09.180 line:95%,end
to being fourth.

00:39:09.246 --> 00:39:11.615 line:95%,end
So if they did the routine
to the best of their ability,

00:39:11.682 --> 00:39:13.184 line:95%,end
then who's responsible here?

00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:14.652 line:95%,end
- You.
- Chloe's back tuck.

00:39:14.719 --> 00:39:15.886 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Oh, my god, Abby.

00:39:15.953 --> 00:39:18.989 line:95%,end
You just can't let the whole
standing back tuck argument go.

00:39:19.056 --> 00:39:21.659 line:95%,end
You know, Chloe clearly
wasn't ready to do it.

00:39:21.726 --> 00:39:23.327 line:95%,end
Maybe you should look at the real reason

00:39:23.394 --> 00:39:26.263 line:95%,end
we got in fourth place, bad choreography.

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:29.133 line:95%,end
ABBY: Chloe,
take a little check and imagine

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:32.236 line:95%,end
if you were equally as flexible
on the right on the left,

00:39:32.303 --> 00:39:34.905 line:95%,end
and if you were on time
every single Monday.

00:39:34.972 --> 00:39:37.608 line:95%,end
Abby, her school is dismissed at 4:30.

00:39:37.675 --> 00:39:39.110 line:95%,end
- She comes--
- So she's late.

00:39:39.176 --> 00:39:40.845 line:95%,end
Why don't you pick her up
and see if you can get her there on time?

00:39:40.911 --> 00:39:42.513 line:95%,end
Why don't you just get her
an early dismissal on Mondays?

00:39:42.613 --> 00:39:44.115 line:95%,end
Because she's not getting
an early dismissal

00:39:44.281 --> 00:39:45.282 line:95%,end
because she's going to school!

00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:48.085 line:95%,end
Christi, stop making excuses
for your kid.

00:39:48.152 --> 00:39:50.020 line:95%,end
Do you have a great kid? Yes.

00:39:50.087 --> 00:39:52.656 line:95%,end
Every parent in America
has a great kid.

00:39:52.823 --> 00:39:54.125 line:95%,end
We get it.

00:39:54.191 --> 00:39:55.860 line:95%,end
Is her left split as good as her right?

00:39:55.926 --> 00:39:56.927 line:95%,end
No.

00:39:57.328 --> 00:39:58.596 line:95%,end
That's my concern.

00:39:59.263 --> 00:40:01.031 line:95%,end
I guess your mom's happy
with mediocre, too.

00:40:01.866 --> 00:40:03.367 line:95%,end
Chloe, you have
to put the work on--

00:40:03.434 --> 00:40:05.636 line:95%,end
- Stop picking on my kid!
- I am not picking on your kid!

00:40:05.703 --> 00:40:08.706 line:95%,end
- You pick on the children!
- Because you're an idiot!

00:40:08.773 --> 00:40:10.341 line:95%,end
You are the biggest idiot I've ever met!

00:40:10.408 --> 00:40:12.977 line:95%,end
If you would get off your phone
and worry about your kid,

00:40:13.043 --> 00:40:14.445 line:95%,end
and worry about her left leg--

00:40:14.512 --> 00:40:16.947 line:95%,end
Abby, there are so many things
I can say to you right now

00:40:17.014 --> 00:40:18.449 line:95%,end
and I'm going say nothing.

00:40:18.516 --> 00:40:19.850 line:95%,end
Really? Really, Christi?

00:40:19.917 --> 00:40:21.385 line:95%,end
- Yeah. OK, fatty.
- ABBY: Really?

00:40:21.452 --> 00:40:23.320 line:95%,end
- Fatty, fatty, fatty, fatty--
- If that's all you got,

00:40:23.387 --> 00:40:24.455 line:95%,end
bring it on, babe.

00:40:24.522 --> 00:40:25.790 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: And you know what?
It doesn't matter--

00:40:25.856 --> 00:40:26.991 line:95%,end
ABBY: Because I can lose
weight, but ugly is to the bone.

00:40:27.057 --> 00:40:28.058 line:95%,end
- CHRISTI: You know what?
- To the bone.

00:40:28.125 --> 00:40:29.160 line:95%,end
Exactly the point.

00:40:29.226 --> 00:40:30.294 line:95%,end
You are ugly to the core.

00:40:30.361 --> 00:40:31.695 line:95%,end
Really?

00:40:31.762 --> 00:40:33.330 line:95%,end
Girls, why don't you guys go outside?

00:40:33.397 --> 00:40:34.899 line:95%,end
Do you hear what your mother's saying?

00:40:34.965 --> 00:40:36.300 line:95%,end
That's what she's teaching you.

00:40:36.367 --> 00:40:38.369 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: That's what
you just said about her mother!

00:40:38.436 --> 00:40:40.704 line:95%,end
Because I think you act
like an idiot in front of her!

00:40:40.771 --> 00:40:41.672 line:95%,end
Again, the big lie.

00:40:41.739 --> 00:40:44.909 line:95%,end
If I just keep saying it over
and over again, it'll be true.

00:40:44.975 --> 00:40:46.343 line:95%,end
I feel sad for you.

00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:47.711 line:95%,end
It's like putting silk stockings

00:40:47.778 --> 00:40:49.180 line:95%,end
on a mule with some of you.

00:40:49.246 --> 00:40:50.714 line:95%,end
Or lipstick on a pig.

00:40:50.781 --> 00:40:53.117 line:95%,end
[laughs]

00:40:53.184 --> 00:40:54.652 line:95%,end
ABBY: Next, on "Dance Moms"--

00:40:54.718 --> 00:40:56.420 line:5%,start
CATHY: I need to be Abby Lee Miller.

00:40:56.487 --> 00:40:57.922 line:5%,start
That's why you guys are here.

00:40:57.988 --> 00:41:01.091 line:5%,start
ABBY: And you all know
how I get when Cathy shows up.

00:41:01.158 --> 00:41:02.760 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: She'll bark when she sees Abby.

00:41:02.827 --> 00:41:04.195 line:5%,start
I bark when I see Abby, too.

00:41:04.261 --> 00:41:05.996 line:5%,start
JILL: I really need her to look great.

00:41:06.063 --> 00:41:08.399 line:5%,start
'Cause when you look good,
you feel good, you do good.

00:41:08.466 --> 00:41:10.434 line:5%,start
I don't like people going behind my back.

00:41:10.501 --> 00:41:11.502 line:5%,start
It wasn't behind your back.

00:41:11.569 --> 00:41:12.870 line:5%,start
I thought I was helping you out.

00:41:12.937 --> 00:41:15.239 line:5%,start
Kendall, I don't think
you'll be doing your solo.

00:41:15.306 --> 00:41:17.508 line:5%,start
Then I'm going home.

00:41:17.575 --> 00:41:18.709 line:5%,start
(CRYING)

00:41:18.776 --> 00:41:21.912 line:5%,start
Nice job, Chloe!
Christi, worry about your own kid!
