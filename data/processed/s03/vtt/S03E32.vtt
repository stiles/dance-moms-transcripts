ABBY (Voiceover):
Feels weird to be going face to face

00:00:05.372 --> 00:00:06.706 line:5%,start
with Kathy and her team without Kelly.

00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:07.941 line:5%,start
I still think she's coming back.

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:11.144 line:5%,start
You will sit here and
say that is not your seat

00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:13.413 line:5%,start
I want Kelly back, when
she constantly runs out

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.948 line:5%,start
on this team with her children.

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:20.754 line:5%,start
Your 9 to 11 Small Group Power
Champion will be Open Waters,

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.189 line:5%,start
[inaudible].

00:00:23.256 --> 00:00:24.891 line:5%,start
I can get in your face, too.

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:25.992 line:5%,start
Why bother?

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:28.061 line:5%,start
Because I'm talking about my son.

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:30.096 line:5%,start
Kelly, Brooke, and Paige
are part of the team.

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:31.197 line:5%,start
Everybody here wants them.

00:00:31.264 --> 00:00:33.600 line:5%,start
Don't you think it hurts me?

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:35.568 line:5%,start
ABBY LEE MILLER (VOICEOVER):
Coming up on "Dance Moms."

00:00:35.668 --> 00:00:38.204 line:5%,start
This week, the competition
is in Orlando, Florida.

00:00:38.271 --> 00:00:41.241 line:5%,start
Leslie, we just want to know
why you want your 15-year-old

00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:42.876 line:5%,start
to dance with our seven-year-old?

00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:45.445 line:5%,start
What I'm telling you is
between you and I right now.

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:47.280 line:5%,start
You are hurting my daughter.

00:00:47.347 --> 00:00:50.650 line:5%,start
The Abby Lee Dance Company
has one president.

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:52.919 line:5%,start
I rule this Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:00:52.986 --> 00:00:54.721 line:5%,start
When opportunity comes knocking,

00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:56.556 line:5%,start
you better take advantage of it.

00:00:56.623 --> 00:00:57.657 line:5%,start
Shame on you.

00:00:57.724 --> 00:00:59.793 line:95%,end
[THEME - LIVING ON THE DANCE
FLOOR, "NIKKO LOWE"]

00:00:59.926 --> 00:01:01.161 line:95%,end
THEME SONG: Get up.

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:03.163 line:95%,end
Get on the floor.

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.166 line:95%,end
My world is with my girls.

00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:09.069 line:95%,end
Living on the dance floor.

00:01:13.673 --> 00:01:16.609 line:5%,start
ABBY LEE MILLER: Come on, girls.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:21.648 line:95%,end
Let's be happy and think
about our victory, shall we?

00:01:21.881 --> 00:01:23.016 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:01:23.183 --> 00:01:25.852 line:95%,end
The Abby Lee Dance Company is on a roll.

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:28.721 line:95%,end
The kids get better, they get
stronger every single day.

00:01:28.788 --> 00:01:31.624 line:5%,start
We beat Kathy without Kelly's kids.

00:01:31.691 --> 00:01:36.763 line:95%,end
Now you did a group routine,
and that group routine was outstanding.

00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:41.267 line:95%,end
Not only did we beat the Crabapples,

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:44.838 line:95%,end
I think that you worked
together on a whole.

00:01:44.904 --> 00:01:46.873 line:95%,end
And I think Payton, what
you bring to the team

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:48.675 line:95%,end
is that you want to be here.

00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:50.310 line:95%,end
Were we missing two team members?

00:01:50.376 --> 00:01:53.146 line:95%,end
Yeah, Brooke and Paige.
They don't want to be here.

00:01:53.213 --> 00:01:57.016 line:95%,end
The Supremes, The
Temptations, even The Beatles

00:01:57.083 --> 00:01:59.385 line:95%,end
replaced people in the group.

00:02:01.888 --> 00:02:02.889 line:95%,end
Keep that in mind.

00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:04.958 line:95%,end
I really don't like the way Abby's acting.

00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:06.359 line:5%,start
2She's acting like Kelly and her girls

00:02:06.426 --> 00:02:08.495 line:5%,start
are going to be replaced
by Payton and Leslie.

00:02:08.561 --> 00:02:11.698 line:95%,end
Brooke and Paige have danced for
the ALDC since they were three.

00:02:11.764 --> 00:02:13.266 line:95%,end
They're not replaceable.

00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:18.738 line:95%,end
First we have Brooke.
No apology, no text.

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:20.540 line:95%,end
And I know she has her phone with her.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.408 line:95%,end
Brooke's 15 years old.

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:25.678 line:95%,end
he knows what's going on, and
she knows right from wrong.

00:02:25.745 --> 00:02:27.714 line:95%,end
And that leads me to Paige.

00:02:27.814 --> 00:02:31.384 line:95%,end
If Paige wanted to dance, Paige
would have come to dance class.

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:33.887 line:95%,end
All right, moving on.

00:02:34.053 --> 00:02:36.322 line:95%,end
Payton.

00:02:36.456 --> 00:02:39.726 line:95%,end
In the dressing room at the competition,
I heard a little smart mouth.

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:41.895 line:95%,end
Just so all of you know, my name's Payton.

00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:43.830 line:95%,end
It's not Kendall, it's not Brooke.

00:02:43.897 --> 00:02:44.898 line:95%,end
It's none of you.
It's Payton.

00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:46.366 line:95%,end
WOMAN: Yes.
Yes.

00:02:46.432 --> 00:02:47.667 line:95%,end
She wasn't getting smart.

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:49.035 line:95%,end
She was just letting you know her name.

00:02:49.102 --> 00:02:50.270 line:95%,end
I know her name's Payton.

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:53.306 line:95%,end
Then call her Payton.
Not Kendall, not Brooke. Payton.

00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:57.577 line:95%,end
How about if I call her replaceable?

00:02:59.445 --> 00:03:01.347 line:95%,end
Now, we have Asia.

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:05.552 line:95%,end
Asia, finally you did the
choreography you were given.

00:03:05.718 --> 00:03:07.120 line:95%,end
You didn't pull focus.

00:03:07.287 --> 00:03:09.222 line:95%,end
But I think whatever you do in the future,

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:10.823 line:95%,end
you need to do both.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.761 line:95%,end
You need to be a star when
that opportunity is available,

00:03:14.827 --> 00:03:17.030 line:95%,end
and I need you to be an ensemble dancer

00:03:17.096 --> 00:03:20.133 line:95%,end
and learn how to take
direction when it calls for it.

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:24.737 line:95%,end
And last on the bottom
rung here is MacKenzie.

00:03:24.904 --> 00:03:28.841 line:95%,end
MacKenzie, you also did a
great job in the group routine.

00:03:29.008 --> 00:03:32.545 line:95%,end
I'm floored that Kenzie's
above Asia right now

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:34.013 line:95%,end
because Asia, that is not her style.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.715 line:95%,end
MELISSA ZIEGLER-GISONI: That's
not Kenzie's style either.

00:03:35.915 --> 00:03:38.751 line:95%,end
I'm just curious to see
why Kenzie's above her now.

00:03:38.985 --> 00:03:40.119 line:95%,end
They're on the same row.

00:03:40.253 --> 00:03:41.221 line:95%,end
But it does make a difference.

00:03:41.287 --> 00:03:44.891 line:5%,start
I just disagree I think Asia
danced with this group better,

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:48.661 line:95%,end
and she was in a style that
she is not normally in.

00:03:48.828 --> 00:03:49.796 line:95%,end
And she pulled it off.

00:03:49.862 --> 00:03:53.266 line:95%,end
Well, MacKenzie, you got on the prop,
you had to jump off the prop.


00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:56.536 line:95%,end
She did the chin stand on the prop
and she did an aerial off the prop.

00:03:56.603 --> 00:03:57.971 line:95%,end
That's why she's ahead of her.

00:03:58.071 --> 00:03:59.305 line:95%,end
I don't think Kristie Ray had a right

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:02.442 line:5%,start
to be mad that MacKenzie
was higher than Asia.

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:05.178 line:5%,start
And Abby said because
she didn't stick out.

00:04:05.345 --> 00:04:08.147 line:95%,end
She just was basic, just
like the other kids.

00:04:08.548 --> 00:04:09.582 line:95%,end
And next.

00:04:10.283 --> 00:04:12.318 line:95%,end
We have Chloe.

00:04:12.385 --> 00:04:14.988 line:95%,end
Now, Chloe, you did
well in the group dance,

00:04:15.221 --> 00:04:17.090 line:95%,end
and you also did well in the trio.

00:04:17.557 --> 00:04:20.093 line:95%,end
Sometimes you win the
battle, but you lose the war.

00:04:22.128 --> 00:04:27.600 line:95%,end
And next we have Maddie.
You do everything right.

00:04:28.201 --> 00:04:30.837 line:95%,end
But if you're up here
all the time winning,

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.372 line:95%,end
you're going to quit working.

00:04:32.538 --> 00:04:37.176 line:95%,end
Maddie needs to keep pushing herself,
and if she keeps winning all the time,

00:04:37.343 --> 00:04:38.878 line:95%,end
she might end up just like Brooke.

00:04:39.212 --> 00:04:43.082 line:95%,end
You've been using that
face for lyrical routines

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:46.586 line:95%,end
for the last how many competitions?

00:04:47.754 --> 00:04:51.724 line:95%,end
But I want to see you dig
just a little bit deeper.

00:04:51.991 --> 00:04:54.227 line:95%,end
I want to see your facial
expressions change.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.596 line:95%,end
Maddie needs to stay hungry.

00:04:56.796 --> 00:05:02.502 line:95%,end
I have seen way too many students peak
when they're 12 years old.

00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:06.039 line:95%,end
I am not going to let
that happen to Maddie.

00:05:06.472 --> 00:05:10.610 line:95%,end
If you win too much when you're
little, you quit working.

00:05:10.777 --> 00:05:13.546 line:95%,end
Next, we're moving on to Kendall.

00:05:13.713 --> 00:05:18.985 line:95%,end
Last week, you were on top of the pyramid.
You did a trio, you did a group routine.

00:05:19.052 --> 00:05:20.586 line:95%,end
Outstanding.

00:05:20.653 --> 00:05:24.023 line:95%,end
And your mother, she stood
in that dressing room

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:28.561 line:95%,end
and she had to take some
really nasty, horrible crap.

00:05:28.628 --> 00:05:32.465 line:95%,end
And your mother stood up for me.
She stood up for the rest of the team.

00:05:32.532 --> 00:05:35.368 line:95%,end
I hate fighting with Kathy and her moms,

00:05:35.802 --> 00:05:37.203 line:5%,start
but if it's going to keep Kendall

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.139 line:5%,start
towards the top of the
pyramid, it's worth the battle.

00:05:40.473 --> 00:05:42.942 line:95%,end
I think somebody is
waiting with bated breath.

00:05:43.042 --> 00:05:45.878 line:95%,end
And the top of the pyramid is Nia.

00:05:48.414 --> 00:05:50.917 line:95%,end
Now I'm sure that all of
you are wondering why Nia

00:05:51.084 --> 00:05:54.354 line:95%,end
is at the top of the pyramid.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.958 line:95%,end
Nia is the only child that
came to me at the conclusion

00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:01.928 line:95%,end
of the competition and
said, what can I do better?

00:06:02.295 --> 00:06:05.765 line:95%,end
Were there any mistakes that I made
in the trio or in the group dance?

00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:08.301 line:95%,end
Yes, you were too far away at the end.

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:10.837 line:95%,end
So, Nia, congratulations.

00:06:11.003 --> 00:06:13.139 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.143 line:95%,end
I can't remember the last time
that I was on the top of the pyramid.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.445 line:5%,start
I've worked so hard and it's great

00:06:19.512 --> 00:06:21.147 line:5%,start
that Abby finally sees that.

00:06:21.314 --> 00:06:22.548 line:95%,end
I have good news.

00:06:23.116 --> 00:06:26.586 line:95%,end
This week, the competition
is in Orlando, Florida.

00:06:26.652 --> 00:06:28.588 line:95%,end
[cheering]

00:06:28.654 --> 00:06:30.289 line:95%,end
Woohoo!

00:06:30.356 --> 00:06:31.724 line:95%,end
I love Orlando.

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:35.595 line:95%,end
I have a house there.
My mom's there right now. I'm there.

00:06:35.695 --> 00:06:37.764 line:95%,end
Everyone is in the group routine.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.932 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:06:40.032 --> 00:06:43.536 line:95%,end
The name of the group
or team is On The Verge.

00:06:43.603 --> 00:06:47.540 line:95%,end
Sometimes there comes a
moment when you lose it.

00:06:48.908 --> 00:06:53.880 line:95%,end
You saw a woman you know very
well spiraling out of control.

00:06:53.946 --> 00:06:57.450 line:95%,end
Never in 40 years of being in
the Abby Lee Dance Company

00:06:57.517 --> 00:07:02.688 line:95%,end
has anyone been given a solo the
day of the [bleep] recital. Ever!

00:07:02.755 --> 00:07:05.158 line:95%,end
You're out. You're out. Call the police.
Get her out of here.

00:07:05.224 --> 00:07:09.228 line:95%,end
How many people are walking
around on the verge?

00:07:09.295 --> 00:07:11.164 line:95%,end
The group dance this week
is called On The Verge.

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:13.433 line:95%,end
I'm on the verge of needing a drink.

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:16.035 line:95%,end
Now I have three solos.

00:07:16.936 --> 00:07:20.706 line:95%,end
Chloe, your featured trio was outstanding.

00:07:20.807 --> 00:07:25.812 line:95%,end
So this week, you're going to be
doing a solo entitled Fired Up.

00:07:25.878 --> 00:07:27.680 line:95%,end
It has a Latin influence.

00:07:27.747 --> 00:07:31.050 line:5%,start
I'm really excited to have a solo,
but I've never done a Latin routine,

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:32.919 line:95%,end
so I don't know what's going to happen.

00:07:32.985 --> 00:07:36.923 line:95%,end
Kendall, you will be performing a solo.

00:07:37.089 --> 00:07:41.594 line:95%,end
It will be contemporary
lyrical, and the routine is called

00:07:41.661 --> 00:07:43.563 line:95%,end
"Under My Spell."

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:47.133 line:95%,end
I am so excited that Kendall's
given a lyrical solo this week.


00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.069 line:95%,end
The lyrical solos are
usually reserved for Maddie.

00:07:50.236 --> 00:07:52.438 line:95%,end
This is a huge opportunity for Kendall

00:07:52.605 --> 00:07:56.976 line:95%,end
to prove that she can handle a Maddie solo
and score well with it.

00:07:57.376 --> 00:07:58.744 line:95%,end
And I have one more solo.

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:05.084 line:95%,end
Nia.
[applause]

00:08:05.218 --> 00:08:06.519 line:95%,end
WOMAN: Yay, Nia.

00:08:06.686 --> 00:08:07.854 line:95%,end
Finally.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.823 line:95%,end
Nia, it's been a long time
since you've had a solo.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:14.527 line:95%,end
And I remember a while back
that you and the other moms

00:08:14.594 --> 00:08:17.930 line:95%,end
and everybody thought
that it would be just wonderful

00:08:17.997 --> 00:08:21.234 line:95%,end
to pay tribute to Broadway Baby.
I disagreed.

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.336 line:95%,end
I didn't think the timing was right.

00:08:23.402 --> 00:08:26.405 line:95%,end
I might be seeing Broadway Baby again.

00:08:26.806 --> 00:08:30.576 line:95%,end
I mean that I had Broadway Baby preserved.

00:08:30.977 --> 00:08:33.713 line:95%,end
But what I'm getting to Nia,
is that you are going

00:08:33.779 --> 00:08:37.049 line:95%,end
to do a Broadway Baby routine.

00:08:37.416 --> 00:08:41.521 line:95%,end
WOMAN: Aww.
[applause]

00:08:42.989 --> 00:08:46.859 line:95%,end
I have to find my pillow case.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.629 line:95%,end
My girls and I were very
close to Broadway Baby.

00:08:49.695 --> 00:08:54.300 line:95%,end
We took care of her when she was sick,
and I was devastated when she passed.

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:59.205 line:95%,end
Maddie would've loved to have done
a tribute to Broadway Baby

00:08:59.305 --> 00:09:02.408 line:95%,end
but I know that Abby's just
trying to teach her a lesson.

00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:06.479 line:95%,end
All right, girls, we are
four weeks away from nationals,

00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:10.850 line:95%,end
but it's time that I start looking for
who's going to be doing a solo

00:09:10.917 --> 00:09:13.819 line:95%,end
when we get there.
I'll be watching you.

00:09:13.886 --> 00:09:15.721 line:95%,end
Let's spread apart.
Let's start warming up.

00:09:15.788 --> 00:09:18.224 line:95%,end
Moms, go ahead.

00:09:18.424 --> 00:09:21.127 line:5%,start
[music playing]

00:09:22.528 --> 00:09:28.634 line:5%,start
What if you didn't brush, wack, threw
that leg behind you and use your momentum?

00:09:28.834 --> 00:09:32.104 line:95%,end
on The Verge is a very difficult piece.

00:09:32.271 --> 00:09:35.641 line:95%,end
It's about women on the
verge of a breakdown,

00:09:35.808 --> 00:09:38.611 line:95%,end
and I think the kids are going to do
a great job with this piece.

00:09:38.678 --> 00:09:42.014 line:95%,end
Take your body lower. Your left shoulder.
Come on, think.

00:09:42.081 --> 00:09:44.417 line:95%,end
Figure out what you're doing.
Why can't you stay there?

00:09:44.483 --> 00:09:48.654 line:95%,end
You know it's kind of funny?
Is I've never seen Abby put anybody

00:09:48.788 --> 00:09:52.858 line:95%,end
like third spot on the pyramid
like she did Maddie for being too perfect.

00:09:52.925 --> 00:09:55.795 line:95%,end
[laughter]
Did anybody else catch that?

00:09:55.995 --> 00:09:58.664 line:95%,end
I mean, it's weird because Maddie
should have been at the top

00:09:58.764 --> 00:10:02.001 line:95%,end
but every week it's something.

00:10:02.068 --> 00:10:04.971 line:95%,end
Excuse me, Melissa,
did you really just say

00:10:05.104 --> 00:10:07.273 line:95%,end
Maddie should have been
at the top of the pyramid?

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:11.010 line:95%,end
I know you're freaking out because Maddie
didn't get the Broadway Baby solo

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:13.279 line:95%,end
or any solo for that matter

00:10:13.379 --> 00:10:15.348 line:95%,end
maybe all that poop scooping
really didn't pay off, did it?

00:10:15.514 --> 00:10:17.550 line:95%,end
Because Nia's the one doing the solo.

00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:19.518 line:95%,end
Really happy for Nia that she has a solo.

00:10:19.585 --> 00:10:24.657 line:95%,end
That's an enormous responsibility,
to do a tribute for Broadway Baby.

00:10:24.724 --> 00:10:27.893 line:95%,end
It better be good and perfect
because she will hold her to it.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.996 line:95%,end
Really, these moms are too much.

00:10:30.196 --> 00:10:33.165 line:95%,end
Holly's been begging
for a solo for months.

00:10:33.232 --> 00:10:36.502 line:95%,end
Now Nia has a solo, and now
it's too much responsibility.

00:10:36.569 --> 00:10:39.505 line:95%,end
Asia can dance with any subject matter
with no complaints

00:10:39.605 --> 00:10:40.740 line:95%,end
it's because she's a professional.

00:10:40.806 --> 00:10:45.945 line:95%,end
Whoa now, slow down. She's seven,
you're 15. You're in charge.

00:10:46.012 --> 00:10:48.648 line:95%,end
If you can't do this to her-- come here.

00:10:49.281 --> 00:10:53.886 line:95%,end
If you can't do this and slow her down,
you're not a leader.

00:10:53.953 --> 00:10:55.488 line:95%,end
Brooke wasn't a
leader.

00:10:55.855 --> 00:10:58.591 line:95%,end
I needed her to step up and
take charge of this team and she didn't.

00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:03.429 line:95%,end
Sorry, I have to go here.
I just think once you've left 3 times,

00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:06.732 line:95%,end
there's got to be a time where you leave
and you are not welcomed back.

00:11:07.633 --> 00:11:11.537 line:5%,start
Being on the elite competition team
is a great opportunity for any dancer,

00:11:11.704 --> 00:11:15.141 line:95%,end
and Kelly is not going to take
that away from my daughter.

00:11:15.207 --> 00:11:18.010 line:95%,end
Not one of you women
feel just a tad bit upset

00:11:18.177 --> 00:11:20.312 line:95%,end
that she constantly picks
up and leaves this team?

00:11:20.379 --> 00:11:22.682 line:95%,end
Well, Leslie, you're also just
desperate to be on the team.

00:11:23.182 --> 00:11:25.084 line:95%,end
So say what you mean, you don't like me?

00:11:27.186 --> 00:11:31.357 line:95%,end
Leslie better be careful, you know?
She's really not a member of this team,

00:11:31.424 --> 00:11:34.193 line:95%,end
and the last thing she wants to
do is make an enemy out of me.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:35.494 line:95%,end
OK, Christi.

Abby really needs to be here.
The girls have nationals coming up,

00:11:56.716 --> 00:12:00.219 line:95%,end

the studio as much as possible

I'm picking up Broadway Baby today,
and I don't know how I feel about this.

I'd forgot kind of what this looked like.

00:12:20.072 --> 00:12:22.575 line:95%,end
I remember walking in the
first time going, whoa.

00:12:22.641 --> 00:12:26.312 line:95%,end
It's still a little unsettling.

I don't want to be disappointed.

I want this to be a happy thing.
A good thing.

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:43.529 line:95%,end
I want Broadway Baby to be preserved
the way I remember her.

Well, we're going to take her home

I know Kelly is still mad at me

her friend for years

Well, you were a jerk to her kids.
Hm.

Maybe there's a reason.
Maybe she wants to talk about something.

It's not like her just to identify
just one or two people.

So we'll see where it goes from here.

I'm not going anywhere, I'm staying.

you're OK with filling in,

say, oh, no, I'm here to stay.

00:16:58.884 --> 00:17:01.220 line:95%,end
No solo. I'm finished.
Get Kendall.

00:17:01.286 --> 00:17:02.488 line:95%,end
Next.

00:17:02.554 --> 00:17:05.691 line:95%,end
- No, she didn't.
- Why did she pull Nia's solo?

00:17:05.758 --> 00:17:07.459 line:95%,end
Go. Go.

00:17:07.559 --> 00:17:09.561 line:95%,end
I'll think about it, I promise.
I'll think about it.

00:17:09.661 --> 00:17:10.963 line:95%,end
I'll think about it. Go.

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.197 line:95%,end
Excuse me.

00:17:12.364 --> 00:17:15.401 line:5%,start
I'm going to go down there to
find out what Abby thinks she's doing

00:17:15.467 --> 00:17:17.936 line:5%,start
doing, because she's definitely
not pulling Nia's solo.

00:17:18.003 --> 00:17:21.040 line:95%,end
If you want to do the
solo, I expect more from you.

00:17:21.206 --> 00:17:24.009 line:95%,end
If I tell somebody to do
something once, I want it done.

00:17:24.176 --> 00:17:26.145 line:95%,end
Twice?
I'm a little aggravated.

00:17:26.211 --> 00:17:28.747 line:95%,end
Five times?
Maybe you shouldn't be doing it.

00:17:28.814 --> 00:17:32.851 line:95%,end
I did it in the room.
I did it.

00:17:33.018 --> 00:17:36.355 line:95%,end
At this point, she's taking way too long
to comprehend the movement.

00:17:36.422 --> 00:17:38.624 line:95%,end
Abby, the solo as of now is pulled--

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:39.658 line:95%,end
You want to be Kelly?

00:17:39.758 --> 00:17:40.959 line:95%,end
We want to start pulling
solos all the time?

00:17:41.026 --> 00:17:42.561 line:95%,end
I didn't pull the solo.
You pulled the solo.

00:17:42.628 --> 00:17:43.562 line:95%,end
No.

00:17:43.629 --> 00:17:45.697 line:95%,end
We have Selective hearing
because I never said that.

00:17:45.764 --> 00:17:47.566 line:95%,end
Abby, I'm pretty sure you're the only one

00:17:47.666 --> 00:17:50.035 line:95%,end
with selective hearing, because
if you hadn't said that

00:17:50.135 --> 00:17:52.304 line:95%,end
you were pulling the solo,
we wouldn't be having

00:17:52.404 --> 00:17:53.739 line:95%,end
this conversation right now.

00:17:53.806 --> 00:17:58.277 line:95%,end
I need you to be more on the ball.
I need you to see it once and nail it.

00:17:58.343 --> 00:18:01.480 line:95%,end
Apparently, Nia still has her
solo, and I want her to do it.

00:18:01.547 --> 00:18:02.481 line:95%,end
- All right, I got to go.
- Drive safe.

00:18:02.548 --> 00:18:03.649 line:95%,end
Thank you.

00:18:03.715 --> 00:18:04.817 line:95%,end
My lips are sealed.

00:18:04.883 --> 00:18:08.687 line:95%,end
My mouth is shut and I'm just going to
walk away while Nia still has a solo.


00:18:13.358 --> 00:18:15.694 line:5%,start
CHRISTI LUKASIAK: Oh, no, no.
I'm in Kelly's seat today.

00:18:15.794 --> 00:18:18.297 line:95%,end
- Why are you in Kelly's seat?
- You still have me on the end.

00:18:18.363 --> 00:18:20.732 line:95%,end
- I wanted to sit there.
- Well, get here.

00:18:20.899 --> 00:18:24.203 line:95%,end
- Kelly's seat is on the end.
- I could not see my daughter yesterday.

00:18:24.303 --> 00:18:25.537 line:95%,end
Oh, wa-wa-wa.

00:18:25.704 --> 00:18:27.840 line:5%,start
If I were Leslie, I would
just shut up and be happy

00:18:27.906 --> 00:18:29.141 line:5%,start
that I was here for the moment.

00:18:29.241 --> 00:18:31.009 line:95%,end
I think you guys are lucky, though.

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:34.379 line:95%,end
I would love and die for Payton
to be getting this special attention.

00:18:34.446 --> 00:18:37.483 line:95%,end
All these critiques are better
than no attention at all.

00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:40.119 line:95%,end
My name is Leslie and I beg, beg, beg

00:18:40.252 --> 00:18:43.322 line:95%,end
for my daughter Payton to be on
the team, and blah blah blah.

00:18:43.388 --> 00:18:46.892 line:95%,end
And I annoy the crap out of everyone.

00:18:47.059 --> 00:18:49.128 line:95%,end
Chloe, let's see.
Come here.

00:18:49.795 --> 00:18:53.432 line:95%,end
If Chloe drops that fan,
I'm moving to South America.

00:18:53.499 --> 00:18:56.735 line:95%,end
- Here you are complaining again.
- No, Leslie, I'm not complaining.

00:18:56.902 --> 00:19:00.139 line:95%,end
All I said was if Chloe drops the fan,
I'm moving to South America

00:19:00.205 --> 00:19:02.508 line:95%,end
because of what happened when
she dropped the hat.

00:19:02.574 --> 00:19:03.976 line:95%,end
But you wouldn't know,
because you weren't here

00:19:04.042 --> 00:19:05.277 line:95%,end
because you're not really on the team.

00:19:05.377 --> 00:19:08.981 line:95%,end
No, I am on the team. I'm here.
You're speaking to me. I'm on this team.

00:19:09.047 --> 00:19:10.249 line:95%,end
You weren't on the team back then.

00:19:10.315 --> 00:19:11.550 line:95%,end
But I am now.

00:19:12.551 --> 00:19:18.657 line:5%,start
I want to see mysterious,
flirtatious, ready to dance.

00:19:19.358 --> 00:19:20.659 line:5%,start
Go.

00:19:21.894 --> 00:19:25.831 line:5%,start
Chloe's solo is called Fired Up.
It's a Spanish routine.

00:19:25.998 --> 00:19:30.702 line:5%,start
I want her to learn proper
Spanish arms, some new steps,

00:19:30.869 --> 00:19:35.874 line:95%,end
and she can use a lot of
ballet technique in this solo.

00:19:36.041 --> 00:19:38.644 line:95%,end
Big.
Takes up four counts.

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:43.315 line:95%,end
Change your face. Smile.
Now mean on the tango. It's serious.

00:19:44.049 --> 00:19:48.987 line:95%,end
It's just this.
You got to give me that whole Spanish.

00:19:49.154 --> 00:19:52.891 line:95%,end
It's very confident. That's what I want
to see when you come on that stage.

00:19:53.058 --> 00:19:56.328 line:95%,end
You're dancing with your whole body.
You're dancing with your face.

00:19:56.495 --> 00:19:58.463 line:95%,end
You're telling the story. Okay?

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:00.032 line:95%,end
- You're finished.
- Thank you.

00:20:00.732 --> 00:20:03.335 line:95%,end
You know, Kristie, you and I are
kind of like in the same boat.

00:20:03.502 --> 00:20:07.739 line:95%,end
Does it bother you that Asia just doesn't
get that time with the solo?

00:20:07.906 --> 00:20:09.274 line:95%,end
Leslie is unbelievable.

00:20:09.441 --> 00:20:11.677 line:5%,start
Other than Maddie, if there's
one other child

00:20:11.743 --> 00:20:14.046 line:5%,start
that's gotten preferential treatment,
it's Asia.

00:20:14.213 --> 00:20:17.249 line:95%,end
Abby said before Asia can
take the world by storm,

00:20:17.416 --> 00:20:19.685 line:95%,end
she has to learn to
perform in a group dance.

00:20:19.851 --> 00:20:21.119 line:95%,end
What are you here for?

00:20:21.286 --> 00:20:23.288 line:95%,end
For Asia to dance with the
team, or to learn from Abby?

00:20:23.455 --> 00:20:25.257 line:95%,end
- I'm just curious.
- Let me just make a statement.

00:20:25.424 --> 00:20:28.126 line:95%,end
Asia's seven.
She did amazing in last week's group.

00:20:28.193 --> 00:20:31.430 line:95%,end
And so when Abby says a comment like that,
she contradicts herself from week to week.

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:33.298 line:95%,end
So I'm used to it, and those comments
don't bother me

00:20:33.365 --> 00:20:36.468 line:95%,end
because Asia's already proved herself.
I hope that answers your questions, Jill.

00:20:36.635 --> 00:20:38.370 line:5%,start
Because if you want to keep
talking about my motivations

00:20:38.537 --> 00:20:41.607 line:5%,start
of being on this team, I
have answers for you outside.

00:20:43.308 --> 00:20:46.144 line:95%,end
Kendall, I don't want to see that
left foot slamming into the ground.

00:20:46.612 --> 00:20:49.681 line:95%,end
That's what you're showing us.
All right, let's go again. You ready?

00:20:49.748 --> 00:20:54.486 line:5%,start
Kendall's solo is called Under My Spell.
It's a contemporary lyrical routine,

00:20:54.686 --> 00:20:57.556 line:95%,end
but it has a little bit of
sass, a little bit of mystery.

00:20:57.656 --> 00:21:00.225 line:95%,end
She's going to put the
judges under her spell.

00:21:00.292 --> 00:21:05.063 line:95%,end
Long neck, shoulders down.
Longer neck.

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:10.335 line:95%,end
What is your face telling me?
You keep letting that all overcome you.

00:21:10.502 --> 00:21:15.574 line:95%,end
What do you doing?
Shoulders down.

00:21:16.475 --> 00:21:21.880 line:95%,end
You have today to come up
with three facial expressions.

00:21:21.947 --> 00:21:24.950 line:95%,end
Is it scary? Is it spooky?
I don't see anything.

00:21:25.017 --> 00:21:27.886 line:95%,end
Maybe you should go ask
Asia about the face.

00:21:28.587 --> 00:21:30.889 line:95%,end
Well, I'm excited to see Kelly tonight.

00:21:31.323 --> 00:21:33.925 line:95%,end
Holly, Jill, are you guys
are excited to see her?

00:21:33.992 --> 00:21:34.893 line:95%,end
I am.

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.462 line:95%,end
I do think it's interesting
that she didn't--

00:21:37.629 --> 00:21:40.565 line:95%,end
do you think she deliberately
did not invite Melissa?

00:21:40.632 --> 00:21:42.100 line:95%,end
- Well, yeah.
- You think that was deliberate?

00:21:42.167 --> 00:21:45.170 line:95%,end
You going to call her and
just try to clear things up so you can--

00:21:45.237 --> 00:21:46.338 line:95%,end
I did call her.

00:21:46.405 --> 00:21:48.073 line:5%,start
Kelly's refusing to talk to me.

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:50.075 line:5%,start
She didn't invite me to
her house for drinks.

00:21:50.142 --> 00:21:51.343 line:95%,end
I didn't really care.

00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:54.379 line:95%,end
We've been friends for so many years,
and we've gone through a lot together.


00:21:54.446 --> 00:21:56.581 line:95%,end
And she's been there for me,
and I've been there for her.

00:21:56.748 --> 00:21:59.217 line:95%,end
And, you know, we'll just
have to get through it.

00:21:59.284 --> 00:22:02.821 line:95%,end
All right, well, I think, Jill and Holly,
we need to get ready to go to Kelly's.

00:22:08.126 --> 00:22:10.896 line:5%,start
CHRISTI LUKASIAK: We're the only three
months this week with children solos.

00:22:10.996 --> 00:22:13.598 line:95%,end
That's right.
High five.

00:22:13.699 --> 00:22:15.300 line:5%,start
I had some of the moms come over just

00:22:15.467 --> 00:22:18.937 line:5%,start
to discuss my situation that I have
at the studio, and with Abby.

00:22:19.004 --> 00:22:22.474 line:95%,end
So what have your kids been doing?
Brooke's been doing her songs.

00:22:22.541 --> 00:22:25.977 line:95%,end
The one song is almost
done being recorded.

00:22:26.144 --> 00:22:28.480 line:95%,end
[gasps]
That's exciting.

00:22:28.647 --> 00:22:31.983 line:95%,end
BROOKE HYLAND: (SINGING) Knows who I am.

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:33.485 line:95%,end
Because I hurt.

00:22:33.652 --> 00:22:38.423 line:95%,end
Yeah, I hurt all over my body.

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:39.791 line:95%,end
Already you have--

00:22:39.958 --> 00:22:42.327 line:95%,end
Oh my God, you've been gone two weeks
and look what she's done.

00:22:42.494 --> 00:22:44.596 line:95%,end
- That's terrific.
- JILL VERTES: That's amazing actually.

00:22:44.763 --> 00:22:45.697 line:95%,end
Thank you. Thank you.

00:22:45.797 --> 00:22:47.566 line:95%,end
- That's very impressive.
- So you will come back?

00:22:47.733 --> 00:22:51.837 line:95%,end
I'm not fighting with Abby, and
I'm not asking her to come back.

00:22:52.003 --> 00:22:53.705 line:95%,end
Paige and Brooke are
already on the pyramid.

00:22:53.805 --> 00:22:55.907 line:95%,end
Their shots are there.
Their photos are up.

00:22:55.974 --> 00:22:58.877 line:95%,end
Abby, whether she wants
to admit it or not

00:22:58.944 --> 00:23:01.113 line:95%,end
she wants those girls on the team.

00:23:01.179 --> 00:23:02.948 line:95%,end
So what do I do
if I come to the competition

00:23:03.048 --> 00:23:05.350 line:95%,end
and she makes a big stink about it?

00:23:05.417 --> 00:23:07.119 line:95%,end
Oh, she will.

00:23:07.285 --> 00:23:09.354 line:95%,end
What if we gave her one
free punch at Melissa?

00:23:09.421 --> 00:23:11.690 line:95%,end
- That won't lure you back?
- It would be at Abby.

00:23:11.857 --> 00:23:14.693 line:95%,end
The things that Abby and Melissa
do are hurting all of our kids.

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:17.996 line:95%,end
I just want things to be
better for all of the girls.

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:22.267 line:95%,end
I'm not going to invite all
over my home, when a week ago,

00:23:22.334 --> 00:23:24.836 line:95%,end
or two weeks ago, you
stabbed my kid in the back

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.906 line:95%,end
and looked right at me and was like,
"I don't know what you want me to do."

00:23:28.073 --> 00:23:29.508 line:95%,end
I want you to open your mouth.

00:23:29.574 --> 00:23:31.309 line:95%,end
As an educator, it's hard for me

00:23:31.476 --> 00:23:36.014 line:95%,end
to watch a parent do that in front
of a whole room full of kids.

00:23:36.181 --> 00:23:37.282 line:95%,end
Look, what Abby did was wrong--

00:23:37.449 --> 00:23:38.650 line:95%,end
But it was okay for her
to do that to my kid?

00:23:38.717 --> 00:23:42.354 line:95%,end
No, no, nope.
It wasn't okay for her to do that either.

00:23:42.421 --> 00:23:44.523 line:5%,start
Kelly's being really immature right now.

00:23:44.589 --> 00:23:47.492 line:5%,start
She made a spectacle, she's
being incredibly stubborn.

00:23:47.559 --> 00:23:50.128 line:95%,end
But right now, she needs to suck it up
and come back to the team.

00:23:50.462 --> 00:23:53.498 line:95%,end
OK, you said that you would
have probably thrown me out

00:23:53.598 --> 00:23:55.700 line:95%,end
because you are a principal and all that.

00:23:55.801 --> 00:23:58.103 line:95%,end
And you say I'm wrong for
sticking up for them for that?

00:23:58.203 --> 00:24:00.906 line:95%,end
And I feel like that's
you being against me.

00:24:00.972 --> 00:24:04.976 line:95%,end
I just feel like Holly sometimes
needs to get out of her mindset

00:24:05.043 --> 00:24:08.180 line:95%,end
that she's a teacher because you're a mom
before you're a teacher.

00:24:08.246 --> 00:24:10.315 line:95%,end
My kid isn't the only
kid that gets picked on.

00:24:10.382 --> 00:24:13.919 line:95%,end
I'm trying to just be a group
and stick up for everybody

00:24:13.985 --> 00:24:15.787 line:95%,end
and I just don't feel like
anybody ever backs me.

00:24:15.854 --> 00:24:18.290 line:95%,end
- Everybody always thinks I'm crazy.
- We do back you.

00:24:18.457 --> 00:24:20.392 line:95%,end
- I back you.
- No you don't.

00:24:20.459 --> 00:24:21.626 line:95%,end
[interposing voices]

00:24:21.793 --> 00:24:24.796 line:95%,end
I just can't step in
and say, yeah, Abby, yeah.

about dance or being a part

of this team or anything.

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:35.073 line:95%,end
If Kelly doesn't come back, that just
means more solos for Kendall.

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:38.310 line:95%,end
I think both of you have seen
how well it works for Melissa

00:24:38.376 --> 00:24:41.847 line:95%,end
to do whatever Abby wants to keep
their kids in her good graces,

00:24:41.913 --> 00:24:44.149 line:95%,end

headed down that path.

our kids to Abby's West Coast Competition

I said to all of you on the phone,
I was asked.

00:24:52.824 --> 00:24:56.461 line:95%,end
Here and now, I said no, so I
need all of you to guarantee,

00:24:56.628 --> 00:24:58.129 line:95%,end
if you're asked, you're going to say no.

00:24:58.597 --> 00:25:02.033 line:95%,end
Abby did ask Kendall to go.
She didn't ask her to perform.

00:25:02.601 --> 00:25:04.503 line:95%,end
So I said no, I'm not going to go.

00:25:04.569 --> 00:25:06.438 line:95%,end
But if she would've been asked to perform?

00:25:07.239 --> 00:25:09.107 line:95%,end
I can't say that. Probably not.

00:25:09.174 --> 00:25:10.976 line:95%,end
It's time for me to kick this bitch out.

00:25:11.109 --> 00:25:12.711 line:95%,end
You need to see yourself to the door.

00:25:12.878 --> 00:25:14.045 line:95%,end
Did you say that?

In the past, the moms have
always stuck together.

00:25:17.048 --> 00:25:19.484 line:95%,end
But I don't think I can
say that any longer.

00:25:19.551 --> 00:25:21.286 line:95%,end
Why do you want to be
divided all the time?

00:25:21.953 --> 00:25:24.823 line:95%,end
I'm not divided all the time.
I didn't lay down the gauntlet.

I rule this Abby Lee Dance Company.

and you have a new kid sitting

00:26:33.224 --> 00:26:36.027 line:95%,end
on the bench, you've got to
cut the quarterback loose,
