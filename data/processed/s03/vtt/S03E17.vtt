ABBY LEE MILLER (VOICEOVER):
Previously on "Dance Moms."

00:00:03.269 --> 00:00:04.104 line:5%,start
Line up, soldiers.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.006 line:5%,start
I don't think some of you want to be here,

00:00:06.072 --> 00:00:09.142 line:5%,start
and I certainly don't think
any of you work hard enough.

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:12.045 line:5%,start
I can't believe you were tattle-telling
on a seven-year-old.

00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:13.613 line:5%,start
People know how my child dances.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.049 line:5%,start
Do you really think anyone who
goes to the dance competition

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:18.051 line:5%,start
knows how your child dances?

00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:20.754 line:5%,start
ABBY LEE MILLER: Kendall,
you're chasing her.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.990 line:5%,start
Second place, entry number 74,
"Free the People."

00:00:24.057 --> 00:00:26.693 line:5%,start
Sometimes you have nothing intelligent
to say, you should just be quiet.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.896 line:5%,start
ABBY LEE MILLER: So today, you will
be voting on Maddie or Chloe.

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:31.231 line:5%,start
Maddie wins.

00:00:31.664 --> 00:00:33.199 line:5%,start
ABBY LEE MILLER (VOICEOVER):
Coming up on "Dance Moms."

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:35.802 line:5%,start
We're getting beat by teachers
that I've never even heard of before.

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:36.803 line:5%,start
Here it comes.

00:00:36.903 --> 00:00:37.737 line:5%,start
Whoo.

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:39.639 line:5%,start
But it's not funny
or cute to throw a kid on stage

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:40.907 line:5%,start
and them not be warmed up.

00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:44.310 line:5%,start
I have been officially invited
to be on "The View."

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:46.179 line:5%,start
[applause]

00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:47.747 line:5%,start
My foot doesn't hurt anymore.

00:00:47.814 --> 00:00:48.648 line:5%,start
And?

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:51.117 line:5%,start
It's about this whole charade.
Don't let her rehearse.

00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:52.218 line:5%,start
- What charade?
- The charade about the foot.

00:00:52.285 --> 00:00:53.820 line:5%,start
What the [bleep] is wrong with the foot?

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:56.222 line:5%,start
I want to know where the miracle
came from, because--

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:57.257 line:5%,start
She rested.

00:00:57.323 --> 00:00:59.893 line:5%,start
Don't take it out on me that Abby
pulled your kid from a dance.

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:02.028 line:5%,start
Why don't you call
the [bleep] doctor and ask him?

00:01:02.095 --> 00:01:04.531 line:95%,end
[MUSIC - NIKKO LOWE, "LIVING ON
THE DANCE FLOOR"]

00:01:04.597 --> 00:01:05.598 line:95%,end
Get up.

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:07.600 line:95%,end
Get on the floor.

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:13.473 line:95%,end
My world is with my girls
living on the dance floor.

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:16.242 line:95%,end
[music continuing]

00:01:18.878 --> 00:01:20.346 line:5%,start
ABBY LEE MILLER: Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go.

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:21.748 line:5%,start
Come on, girls. Get in here.

00:01:22.282 --> 00:01:25.151 line:95%,end
On the presidential campaign,
this means peace.

00:01:25.218 --> 00:01:27.787 line:95%,end
But here at Abby League Dance Company,
it means seconds.

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:34.060 line:95%,end
Not only are we getting beat
by Kathy's brilliant team of imports,

00:01:34.127 --> 00:01:37.464 line:95%,end
we're getting beat by teachers
that I've never even heard of before.

00:01:38.231 --> 00:01:39.232 line:95%,end
We were the losers.

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.136 line:95%,end
ALDC lost again, two weeks in a row.

00:01:43.837 --> 00:01:45.271 line:5%,start
How are we going to recover?

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.608 line:5%,start
How are these dancers going to get better?

00:01:48.675 --> 00:01:50.844 line:95%,end
How do they improve in a week?

00:01:51.544 --> 00:01:53.179 line:95%,end
Put the effort forth.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.881 line:95%,end
You get out what you put in.

00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:56.916 line:5%,start
All right, I want to get to the pyramid.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.285 line:95%,end
First, I have Mackenzie.

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:00.286 line:95%,end
You didn't dance.

00:02:00.353 --> 00:02:02.555 line:95%,end
Next, Paige.

00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:06.659 line:95%,end
That flag was a symbol
for everybody in that audience.

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:09.329 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.836 line:95%,end
Don't do a disservice to this country.

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:20.073 line:5%,start
Abby puts Paige at the bottom
of the pyramid

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.343 line:5%,start
because she held the flag
upside down the wrong way.

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:26.212 line:95%,end
That's why we didn't win because Paige
held the flag the wrong way.

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:28.515 line:95%,end
And next, Kendall.

00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:31.417 line:95%,end
We've worked on your facial expressions.

00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:32.752 line:95%,end
They've improved.

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.487 line:95%,end
We've worked on your stamina.

00:02:34.554 --> 00:02:35.889 line:95%,end
That's getting there.

00:02:36.222 --> 00:02:37.957 line:95%,end
Now focus.

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:41.294 line:95%,end
Wherever your eyes go,
that's where the judges' eyes go.

00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:46.132 line:95%,end
You can't watch Maddie
like a member of the audience.

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:48.735 line:95%,end
And next I have Brooke.

00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:52.539 line:95%,end
Brooke, during rehearsal,
you did an outstanding job.

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:56.276 line:95%,end
Then we get on stage
and you go right by Asia and the flag

00:02:56.342 --> 00:02:58.244 line:95%,end
and then you have to wait four counts.

00:02:59.312 --> 00:03:01.314 line:95%,end
You have to think on stage.

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:03.483 line:95%,end
Chloe.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.185 line:95%,end
Chloe, you did a solo.

00:03:05.251 --> 00:03:06.553 line:95%,end
You did a nice job.

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:08.588 line:95%,end
You were second only to Maddie.

00:03:08.655 --> 00:03:09.956 line:95%,end
Corrections.

00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:11.457 line:95%,end
Hyperextending the elbows.

00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:13.459 line:95%,end
Not lengthening the back of the knee.

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:18.097 line:95%,end
You can fix all of those things,
but you have to want to.

00:03:18.164 --> 00:03:20.567 line:95%,end
And next, Nia.

00:03:20.633 --> 00:03:21.935 line:95%,end
You did an outstanding job.

00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:23.303 line:95%,end
I thought you looked good in the group.

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:24.470 line:95%,end
I noticed you in the group.

00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:26.673 line:95%,end
I also noticed that you were smart

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.543 line:95%,end
and you figured out you couldn't
live Asia until she got there.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.545 line:5%,start
Finally Abby notices Nia.

00:03:32.612 --> 00:03:34.914 line:5%,start
She's making it to the middle
row of the pyramid.

00:03:34.981 --> 00:03:36.216 line:5%,start
That's a good thing.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.751 line:5%,start
And next.


00:03:38.818 --> 00:03:42.355 line:95%,end
Asia, you won the overall
high score in the petite division.

00:03:43.156 --> 00:03:46.192 line:95%,end
I think that you're a little firecracker,

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:50.063 line:95%,end
and I think you step on stage
and you cause an explosion.

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:51.431 line:95%,end
So Asia's number 2.

00:03:51.497 --> 00:03:55.368 line:5%,start
I'll take the 2 for this time, as long as
she doesn't drop lower than that.

00:03:55.802 --> 00:03:58.338 line:95%,end
And on top of the pyramid.

00:03:58.404 --> 00:04:01.541 line:95%,end
Maddie, you were the overall high scorer

00:04:01.608 --> 00:04:02.775 line:95%,end
of the junior division.

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:05.778 line:95%,end
And in first place, entry number 30,
"I'm Trying."

00:04:05.845 --> 00:04:08.147 line:95%,end
- Yeah, Maddie.
- Whoo-hoo.

00:04:08.514 --> 00:04:10.283 line:95%,end
Your friends voted for you, too.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.484 line:95%,end
It was a good performance.

00:04:11.551 --> 00:04:16.055 line:5%,start
You are the type of personality
that this country was built on.

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:18.858 line:95%,end
You all know that song
"America the Beautiful?"

00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:21.327 line:95%,end
Maddie, you are America the Beautiful.

00:04:22.128 --> 00:04:22.929 line:5%,start
You're welcome.

00:04:22.996 --> 00:04:25.198 line:95%,end
People have accused me
of playing favorites.

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:27.634 line:95%,end
Maddie gets what she deserves.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.035 line:95%,end
She puts in the time.

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:30.236 line:95%,end
She puts in the energy.

00:04:30.303 --> 00:04:31.638 line:95%,end
She wants it.

00:04:32.705 --> 00:04:34.173 line:95%,end
Why wouldn't she be the favorite?

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.809 line:95%,end
Now, before I get started
on this week's assignments,

00:04:36.876 --> 00:04:38.611 line:95%,end
I want to ask Mackenzie
where your cast is.

00:04:38.678 --> 00:04:40.546 line:95%,end
You should have an air cast on that foot.

00:04:41.014 --> 00:04:42.782 line:95%,end
My foot doesn't hurt anymore.

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:43.850 line:95%,end
And?

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:45.718 line:95%,end
What's your doctor's excuse?

00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:47.153 line:95%,end
Did you go to the doctor again?

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:48.588 line:95%,end
No.

00:04:48.655 --> 00:04:49.789 line:95%,end
I mean, yeah.

00:04:49.856 --> 00:04:50.757 line:95%,end
No, you did not, Kenz.

00:04:50.823 --> 00:04:52.358 line:95%,end
You didn't go back to the doctor.

00:04:52.425 --> 00:04:54.861 line:95%,end
Tell her exactly what the doctor told you.

00:04:55.461 --> 00:04:57.330 line:95%,end
He said that it's OK to dance.

00:04:57.964 --> 00:04:59.599 line:95%,end
And how did he look at your foot again?

00:04:59.899 --> 00:05:00.967 line:95%,end
He didn't.

00:05:01.367 --> 00:05:02.635 line:95%,end
So over the phone?

00:05:02.702 --> 00:05:06.372 line:95%,end
He said that she has to
rest it until it feels 100%.

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:07.540 line:95%,end
She knows her own body.

00:05:07.607 --> 00:05:08.574 line:95%,end
She knows her own body?

00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:11.377 line:95%,end
She can't even create
a sentence to answer me with.

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:12.979 line:95%,end
I'm sorry.

00:05:13.513 --> 00:05:16.749 line:95%,end
The doctor said two weeks
and I don't feel comfortable

00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:18.518 line:95%,end
going against his wishes.

00:05:18.584 --> 00:05:20.186 line:95%,end
It has not been two weeks.

00:05:20.253 --> 00:05:23.456 line:95%,end
I don't want Mackenzie dancing
because she's eight years old.

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:24.824 line:95%,end
She's little.

00:05:24.891 --> 00:05:27.960 line:95%,end
Those tiny, little bones
in her feet are fragile.

00:05:28.027 --> 00:05:32.598 line:95%,end
And Mackenzie has the potential
to go the distance in her dance career.

00:05:32.932 --> 00:05:35.535 line:95%,end
I don't want to do something
now that's going to prevent her

00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:37.937 line:95%,end
from having a career
further down the line.

00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:39.706 line:95%,end
Let's talk about this week.

00:05:39.772 --> 00:05:44.610 line:95%,end
We are headed to Energy Dance Competition
in Youngstown, Ohio.

00:05:44.677 --> 00:05:46.879 line:95%,end
I'm sure that Kathy is going to be there.

00:05:46.946 --> 00:05:50.116 line:95%,end
I'm sure her boy group
will be back in full force.

00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:52.418 line:95%,end
But I'm really not too
concerned with Kathy.

00:05:52.485 --> 00:05:55.455 line:95%,end
I'm worried about the other
studios in Youngstown, Ohio.

00:05:55.722 --> 00:05:58.424 line:95%,end
The group number is entitled
to "Hear No Evil."

00:05:58.491 --> 00:06:02.662 line:95%,end
Everyone is in it,
except Mackenzie and Maddie.

00:06:03.896 --> 00:06:07.066 line:95%,end
Maddie, you will not be dancing with
the group in the group routine.

00:06:07.834 --> 00:06:10.703 line:95%,end
You will be assisting me
with the choreography.

00:06:11.838 --> 00:06:14.607 line:95%,end
I don't think the rest of the
group is as serious as Maddie.

00:06:14.674 --> 00:06:17.243 line:95%,end
They just say, well, Maddie
will figure out the counts.

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:18.511 line:95%,end
Maddie will know the music.

00:06:18.578 --> 00:06:20.446 line:95%,end
So I want to teach them a lesson.

00:06:21.114 --> 00:06:22.048 line:95%,end
They all need to be the leaders.

00:06:22.181 --> 00:06:24.384 line:95%,end
They all need to know what's going on.

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.352 line:95%,end
Maddie, you will be doing a solo.

00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:30.189 line:95%,end
The name of your solo
is "They'll Never Change."

00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:35.161 line:95%,end
Asia, you will be performing
a duet with Nia.

00:06:35.228 --> 00:06:37.330 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:41.234 line:95%,end
The name of your routine
is "Move You Too."

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.737 line:95%,end
And Asia, I'm expecting
my little firecracker

00:06:44.804 --> 00:06:46.072 line:95%,end
to light Nia up.

00:06:47.573 --> 00:06:51.277 line:95%,end
We're going to get Nia moving faster,
jumping higher.

00:06:51.344 --> 00:06:54.781 line:95%,end
Nia, when Asia's leg is up here,

00:06:54.847 --> 00:06:56.783 line:95%,end
her leg better be up there.

00:06:56.849 --> 00:07:00.987 line:95%,end
You can't be any less
than Asia is on stage.

00:07:01.988 --> 00:07:03.656 line:95%,end
It's going to be hard
for anyone dancing with Asia

00:07:03.723 --> 00:07:06.459 line:95%,end
to match her energy,
but Nia can hold her own,

00:07:06.526 --> 00:07:08.795 line:95%,end
and she can definitely
bring it to the dance floor.

00:07:08.861 --> 00:07:11.731 line:95%,end
I think Nia will be just fine
dancing with Asia.

00:07:12.031 --> 00:07:13.199 line:95%,end
I have one more solo.

00:07:13.733 --> 00:07:14.967 line:95%,end
It's going to Chloe.

00:07:15.034 --> 00:07:16.469 line:95%,end
It's contemporary.


00:07:16.536 --> 00:07:19.172 line:95%,end
And the name of the routine
is "About Mother."

00:07:19.705 --> 00:07:21.374 line:95%,end
Moms, you are dismissed.

00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:22.875 line:95%,end
Ladies, spread apart.

00:07:27.246 --> 00:07:30.183 line:5%,start
I'm taking you out of that group
because I think they're dragging you down.

00:07:30.249 --> 00:07:31.884 line:95%,end
And if you had a bunch of people
to dance with that were

00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:34.554 line:95%,end
on your level that wanted it,
you would be first place all the time.

00:07:34.954 --> 00:07:37.156 line:95%,end
You have to worry about you, understood?

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:40.059 line:5%,start
Maddie's solo is called
"They'll Never Change."

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.729 line:5%,start
Who is she referring to in "they?"

00:07:43.796 --> 00:07:44.697 line:95%,end
I don't know.

00:07:44.764 --> 00:07:46.732 line:95%,end
Maybe the other girls in the group.

00:07:47.266 --> 00:07:48.701 line:95%,end
Maybe they're not going to change.

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:50.803 line:95%,end
Maybe they're not going
to try to work harder.

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.939 line:95%,end
Or maybe it's the other moms.

00:07:53.005 --> 00:07:55.274 line:95%,end
Maybe they'll never change
and they'll always

00:07:55.341 --> 00:07:56.476 line:95%,end
be jealous of Maddie.

00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:00.513 line:95%,end
I think if Abby thinks that Maddie
is so much more mature

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.181 line:95%,end
then Maddie should move
up to the senior group.

00:08:02.248 --> 00:08:04.450 line:95%,end
That's exactly-- then what's she
doing dancing with these kids,

00:08:04.517 --> 00:08:06.819 line:95%,end
week after week after week
if they're holding her back.

00:08:06.886 --> 00:08:07.720 line:95%,end
KELLY: Exactly. Move her out of our group.

00:08:07.787 --> 00:08:11.624 line:95%,end
If Abby thinks that Maddie is too good
for this group, pull her.

00:08:11.691 --> 00:08:13.259 line:95%,end
Have her dance with your seniors.

00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:14.327 line:95%,end
We don't need her.

00:08:14.393 --> 00:08:15.962 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:08:16.028 --> 00:08:16.863 line:95%,end
On your left.

00:08:16.929 --> 00:08:19.432 line:95%,end
8, 4, 5.

00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:23.870 line:95%,end
Maddie is demonstrating this week because
she's not such a second place performer.

00:08:24.403 --> 00:08:26.172 line:95%,end
She's a winner. She's a champion.

00:08:26.472 --> 00:08:27.373 line:95%,end
She's an artist.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.609 line:95%,end
She wants to do this 24/7.

00:08:29.675 --> 00:08:34.647 line:95%,end
It's totally unrealistic
and illogical to make it

00:08:34.714 --> 00:08:39.619 line:95%,end
so that Maddie is the only one that has
goals, aspirations, and everyone else--

00:08:39.685 --> 00:08:40.686 line:95%,end
And talent.

00:08:40.753 --> 00:08:43.122 line:95%,end
And talent and ambition.

00:08:49.362 --> 00:08:52.198 line:95%,end
The group routine is entitled
"Hear No Evil."

00:08:52.265 --> 00:08:54.000 line:95%,end
It's going to be a challenge
for the girls.

00:08:54.066 --> 00:08:56.736 line:95%,end
The music is difficult to count to.

00:08:56.802 --> 00:08:59.138 line:95%,end
So I'm going to pull their leader,

00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:02.842 line:95%,end
the one with the great musicality,
out of the group

00:09:02.909 --> 00:09:04.343 line:95%,end
and see how they handle it.

00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:09.715 line:95%,end
Every one of these girls
need to be the Maddie.

00:09:09.782 --> 00:09:12.151 line:95%,end
Melissa, are you comfortable with Maddie

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:14.687 line:95%,end
being the assistant
choreographer of our group?

00:09:14.754 --> 00:09:18.124 line:95%,end
I heard her say she's
going to be assisting.

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:20.493 line:95%,end
Yeah, don't be calling
her assistant choreographer.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.162 line:95%,end
What is the difference between
choreographing

00:09:23.229 --> 00:09:24.330 line:95%,end
and assistant choreographer?

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:25.531 line:5%,start
What's the difference?

00:09:25.865 --> 00:09:27.533 line:5%,start
And it really doesn't
make a difference to me

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.235 line:5%,start
if Abby pulls Maddie
out of the group dance.

00:09:29.302 --> 00:09:31.704 line:95%,end
I mean, Abby tells us every week
that Maddie is so much better

00:09:31.771 --> 00:09:35.007 line:95%,end
than our girls, so take
her out of the group then.

00:09:36.008 --> 00:09:37.710 line:95%,end
Asia.

00:09:37.777 --> 00:09:40.580 line:95%,end
But I have to say,
I know these girls have been dancing

00:09:40.646 --> 00:09:43.082 line:95%,end
together for a long time,
but I don't know.

00:09:43.149 --> 00:09:44.784 line:95%,end
Does she pick up choreography fast?

00:09:45.418 --> 00:09:47.520 line:95%,end
Right here in rehearsal, she might be--

00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:48.688 line:95%,end
Oh, I know what you're saying.

00:09:48.754 --> 00:09:50.756 line:95%,end
Yeah, but on stage, it comes together.

00:09:51.023 --> 00:09:52.925 line:95%,end
Asia isn't keeping up
well with this group.

00:09:53.025 --> 00:09:54.694 line:5%,start
They're a well-oiled machine.

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.562 line:5%,start
Asia's new to the group.

00:09:56.629 --> 00:09:58.931 line:5%,start
She's several years
younger than most of them

00:09:58.998 --> 00:10:00.533 line:95%,end
and she's half their size.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.767 line:95%,end
It's not a good fit.

00:10:01.834 --> 00:10:03.903 line:95%,end
So what happens when
Kenzie's put in a group?

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:05.938 line:95%,end
Is she behind the choreography
with the older girls

00:10:06.005 --> 00:10:07.607 line:95%,end
because she's small, or you're--

00:10:07.673 --> 00:10:12.478 line:95%,end
Not wrong, not off, not slower,
but the timing.

00:10:12.545 --> 00:10:14.714 line:95%,end
Speaking of Mackenzie, I have a question.

00:10:15.881 --> 00:10:19.385 line:95%,end
What changed with Mackenzie
that now she's 100% ready to go?

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:20.720 line:95%,end
Because her foot feels better.

00:10:20.786 --> 00:10:23.823 line:95%,end
Either Mackenzie really
wasn't that hurt to begin with

00:10:23.889 --> 00:10:26.092 line:95%,end
or she's really still hurt now.

00:10:26.158 --> 00:10:28.027 line:95%,end
But one way or the other, you're lying.

00:10:28.427 --> 00:10:31.397 line:95%,end
This is what my- the doctor
said to me, Christi.

00:10:31.764 --> 00:10:35.434 line:95%,end
Kenzie can dance when she feels
100% confident in her foot.

00:10:35.501 --> 00:10:36.636 line:95%,end
She knows her body.

00:10:36.702 --> 00:10:38.404 line:95%,end
You have been going on and on and on
for weeks

00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:40.773 line:95%,end
that she can't dance,
she can dance, she can't dance.

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.342 line:95%,end
But she rested for a whole week
doing literally nothing.

00:10:43.709 --> 00:10:46.679 line:95%,end
A week really isn't that long to rest.

00:10:46.746 --> 00:10:47.580 line:95%,end
Well, you know what?

00:10:47.647 --> 00:10:49.715 line:95%,end
Mackenzie feels better and she's fine.


00:10:53.185 --> 00:10:54.854 line:5%,start
[phone ringing]

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:55.755 line:5%,start
Hello?

00:10:55.821 --> 00:10:57.189 line:5%,start
It's Teresa.

00:10:57.256 --> 00:11:00.192 line:5%,start
I got some really super,
exciting news for you.

00:11:11.704 --> 00:11:12.905 line:95%,end
[laughs]

00:11:12.972 --> 00:11:14.607 line:95%,end
That is crazy.

00:11:17.576 --> 00:11:18.611 line:95%,end
Oh my god. Oh my god.

00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:19.812 line:95%,end
I want to sit next to Whoopie.

00:11:19.879 --> 00:11:22.348 line:95%,end
I am so excited to be going to "The View."

00:11:22.415 --> 00:11:24.917 line:5%,start
But me sitting there next to them,

00:11:24.984 --> 00:11:26.318 line:5%,start
I'm a little bit nervous about that.

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:41.934 line:95%,end
I am super stoked about my kids
performing on "The View."

00:11:42.001 --> 00:11:45.337 line:95%,end
Come on, that is amazing
advertisement for my studio.

00:11:46.238 --> 00:11:48.808 line:95%,end
I'm guest-hosting "The View."

00:11:48.874 --> 00:11:50.743 line:95%,end
[laughs]

00:11:52.745 --> 00:11:54.547 line:95%,end
She's wooing, whooping, and hollering.

00:11:54.613 --> 00:11:56.182 line:95%,end
[wooing]

00:11:56.248 --> 00:11:57.650 line:95%,end
She's distracted by a phone call.

00:11:57.717 --> 00:12:00.519 line:95%,end
I think Abby calls a 900 number,
I swear to God.

00:12:00.953 --> 00:12:04.056 line:95%,end
I need everybody in studio A.
Everybody, come on.

00:12:06.892 --> 00:12:08.627 line:95%,end
I have a big announcement to make.

00:12:09.195 --> 00:12:12.198 line:95%,end
I just got a phone call
and I have been officially

00:12:12.264 --> 00:12:16.836 line:95%,end
invited to be a guest host on "The View."

00:12:16.902 --> 00:12:19.905 line:95%,end
[cheering]

00:12:20.706 --> 00:12:22.908 line:95%,end
Oh, oh my god.

00:12:23.776 --> 00:12:27.446 line:95%,end
So I will be hosting
the entire hour of "The View."

00:12:27.513 --> 00:12:30.549 line:5%,start
I think Abby can hold her own,
but I am a little bit worried

00:12:30.616 --> 00:12:32.384 line:5%,start
about what's going
to come out of her mouth.

00:12:32.451 --> 00:12:36.589 line:95%,end
Of course, I am going to have the
Abby Lee Dance Company competition team,

00:12:36.655 --> 00:12:40.326 line:95%,end
one of our winning group routines
perform on "The View."

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.028 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:46.198 line:95%,end
Excited?

00:12:46.332 --> 00:12:47.399 line:95%,end
Yes.

00:12:47.466 --> 00:12:48.801 line:95%,end
I'm excited to go to New York.

00:12:48.868 --> 00:12:51.937 line:5%,start
This is a great opportunity
for the girls to be on "The View."

00:12:52.004 --> 00:12:54.640 line:95%,end
As far as the moms go,
if Abby doesn't want the moms to go,

00:12:54.707 --> 00:12:56.442 line:95%,end
I love to shop in New York.

00:12:56.509 --> 00:12:58.177 line:95%,end
So I'm excited.

00:12:58.244 --> 00:13:01.614 line:95%,end
So next week, we will be
traveling to New York City.

00:13:02.181 --> 00:13:03.082 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:13:03.149 --> 00:13:05.151 line:95%,end
Unfortunately, the lady from "The View"

00:13:05.217 --> 00:13:07.820 line:95%,end
said I need to submit
the routine that they're

00:13:07.887 --> 00:13:10.055 line:95%,end
going to be performing tonight.

00:13:10.122 --> 00:13:13.325 line:95%,end
So we need to do
something that is exciting

00:13:13.392 --> 00:13:15.694 line:95%,end
and something that lets people think.

00:13:17.163 --> 00:13:17.997 line:5%,start
You like that one?

00:13:18.063 --> 00:13:18.931 line:95%,end
That's beautiful.

00:13:18.998 --> 00:13:21.967 line:95%,end
I'm excited about co-hosting
"The View," but you know what?

00:13:22.034 --> 00:13:23.636 line:95%,end
There is no rest for the weary.

00:13:24.103 --> 00:13:26.305 line:95%,end
We still have a big competition
this weekend.

00:13:26.372 --> 00:13:29.742 line:95%,end
We need to perfect the group number
and get the solos ready.

00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:32.545 line:95%,end
All right, spread apart.
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

00:13:33.612 --> 00:13:36.015 line:5%,start
I want to know how long
this happiness will last for Abby.

00:13:36.081 --> 00:13:39.919 line:95%,end
That's big news, so that means
she'll ride that high for, 

00:13:39.985 --> 00:13:41.787 line:95%,end
I don't know,
the rest of the night would be nice.

00:13:41.854 --> 00:13:44.523 line:95%,end
It's one thing being a guest,
but she's an actual host.

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:46.425 line:5%,start
- I know.
- Come on. Let's go from the top, Maddie.

00:13:46.492 --> 00:13:47.326 line:5%,start
You got it?

00:13:48.093 --> 00:13:49.995 line:5%,start
[MUSIC - WE THE COMMITTEE, "THIS
WON'T END QUIETLY"]

00:13:50.462 --> 00:13:53.966 line:95%,end
You told me we were fighters, fighters.

00:13:54.633 --> 00:13:56.769 line:95%,end
Watch with the knuckles
when you push forward, Chloe.

00:13:56.836 --> 00:13:58.537 line:95%,end
The group can win without Maddie.

00:13:58.604 --> 00:14:00.172 line:95%,end
It should win without Maddie.

00:14:00.239 --> 00:14:02.741 line:95%,end
The problem is they rely on Maddie.


00:14:03.108 --> 00:14:05.444 line:95%,end
Girls, you need to step up to the plate.

00:14:05.511 --> 00:14:07.379 line:95%,end
You need to listen to the music.

00:14:07.446 --> 00:14:08.447 line:95%,end
And you're not.

00:14:08.514 --> 00:14:10.349 line:95%,end
You're letting Maddie do the work.

00:14:10.416 --> 00:14:14.987 line:95%,end
Kendall and Brooke obviously
were doing a different time

00:14:15.054 --> 00:14:18.424 line:95%,end
and they felt they were right,
and the other people were way ahead.

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:20.392 line:95%,end
They kept going because they
thought they were right.

00:14:20.459 --> 00:14:21.961 line:95%,end
Maddie, who did you think was right?

00:14:24.063 --> 00:14:25.397 line:95%,end
All right, let's go again.

00:14:25.631 --> 00:14:29.168 line:5%,start
Maddie told me she's happy and sad
about assisting.

00:14:29.235 --> 00:14:34.073 line:95%,end
She said she loves doing it, but she's sad
because she wants to be in the dance,

00:14:34.139 --> 00:14:36.775 line:95%,end
and she doesn't want any of her
friends to get angry with her.

00:14:37.142 --> 00:14:38.244 line:95%,end
Melissa, do you think that Maddie

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:41.113 line:95%,end
is uncomfortable with Abby leaving her
in charge of her friends?

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:44.617 line:95%,end
Yeah. She said that she's happy
and sad at the same time.

00:14:44.683 --> 00:14:47.620 line:95%,end
Do you think Maddie misses
being in a group dance this week?

00:14:47.686 --> 00:14:48.520 line:95%,end
Absolutely.

00:14:48.587 --> 00:14:51.423 line:95%,end
Whatever Abby wants her to do,
you know she's going to listen to that.

Is Mackenzie frustrated after
the pyramid yesterday, 

00:14:54.526 --> 00:14:57.296 line:95%,end
because Abby has been doing
absolutely nothing again this week,

00:14:57.363 --> 00:14:59.665 line:95%,end
and she feels like she can dance.

00:14:59.732 --> 00:15:02.768 line:5%,start
Melissa said that Mackenzie
had to be off of her foot,

00:15:02.835 --> 00:15:05.004 line:95%,end
doctor's orders, for two weeks.

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:08.040 line:95%,end
And I don't think Melissa
really thought that Abby was going

00:15:08.107 --> 00:15:11.277 line:5%,start
to take her for her work,
and two weeks is two weeks.

00:15:14.046 --> 00:15:16.048 line:95%,end
I went round and round
with some of the numbers

00:15:16.115 --> 00:15:19.451 line:95%,end
and I think that we should do
"The Last Text" for "The View."

00:15:26.358 --> 00:15:29.628 line:95%,end
I think that it's an important piece,

00:15:29.695 --> 00:15:32.598 line:95%,end
and I think we have a message
to send out to all the viewers.

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:41.140 line:95%,end
All I need you to do is a roundoff
back handspring

00:15:41.807 --> 00:15:43.575 line:95%,end
to that corner
and fall to the ground.

00:15:43.642 --> 00:15:45.177 line:95%,end
What number is this?

00:15:45.244 --> 00:15:46.712 line:95%,end
It's called "The Final Text?"

00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:47.813 line:95%,end
HOLLY: "The Last Text."

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:48.914 line:95%,end
KRISTIE RAY: What is Asia doing?

00:15:48.981 --> 00:15:50.716 line:95%,end
Replacing Mackenzie, it looks like,

00:15:50.783 --> 00:15:53.052 line:95%,end
but she won't let Kenzie dance.

00:15:53.118 --> 00:15:54.553 line:95%,end
Mackenzie is not dancing right now

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:56.455 line:95%,end
and we need to rehearse this routine,

00:15:56.522 --> 00:15:58.457 line:95%,end
so why wouldn't I put Asia in the number?

00:16:00.259 --> 00:16:01.360 line:5%,start
JILL: They don't-
She doesn't dance.

00:16:01.427 --> 00:16:02.695 line:95%,end
She does a roundoff back
handspring and done.

00:16:02.761 --> 00:16:04.096 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Back handspring and done.

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:07.266 line:95%,end
Oh my gosh, so do you think Abby
won't let her dance?

00:16:07.333 --> 00:16:08.767 line:95%,end
Well, maybe it's just for rehearsal.

00:16:08.834 --> 00:16:09.902 line:95%,end
We'll see.

00:16:10.069 --> 00:16:12.471 line:95%,end
I mean, I think Asia
could be a backup for Mackenzie,

00:16:12.538 --> 00:16:15.174 line:95%,end
but she's not a team member.

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:17.443 line:95%,end
Mackenzie is a team member.

00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:19.144 line:95%,end
Well, Mackenzie is injured, right?

00:16:19.211 --> 00:16:20.646 line:95%,end
She was. You saw her crying.

00:16:20.713 --> 00:16:21.914 line:95%,end
OK, but she's better now.

00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:24.316 line:95%,end
I want to know where
the miracle came from because--

00:16:24.383 --> 00:16:25.384 line:95%,end
She rested.

00:16:25.451 --> 00:16:26.618 line:95%,end
- OK.
- Please.

00:16:26.685 --> 00:16:27.987 line:95%,end
It's really none of your concern.

00:16:28.053 --> 00:16:30.622 line:95%,end
She's not in the dance so be happy,
because that's what you want.

00:16:30.689 --> 00:16:31.757 line:95%,end
No, that's not true.

00:16:31.824 --> 00:16:32.825 line:95%,end
Absolutely it is.

00:16:32.891 --> 00:16:35.761 line:5%,start
Melissa made such a big deal
about Mackenzie can't dance.

00:16:35.828 --> 00:16:37.162 line:5%,start
She's crying in pain.

00:16:37.229 --> 00:16:38.397 line:95%,end
It hurts so bad.

00:16:38.464 --> 00:16:40.899 line:95%,end
Now all of a sudden the girls
are dancing on "The View"

00:16:40.966 --> 00:16:43.068 line:95%,end
and Mackenzie had a miraculous recovery.

00:16:43.135 --> 00:16:44.169 line:95%,end
It just doesn't jive.

00:16:44.236 --> 00:16:46.572 line:95%,end
- She's fine. Ask her yourself.
- How?

00:16:46.638 --> 00:16:48.774 line:95%,end
Why don't you call the
[bleep] doctor and ask him?

00:16:49.274 --> 00:16:51.944 line:95%,end
Don't take it out on me that Abby
pulled your kid from a dance, 

00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:53.979 line:95%,end
because my kid and the rest of our kids

00:16:54.046 --> 00:16:56.181 line:95%,end
have been listening to Abby
talk about how wonderful

00:16:56.248 --> 00:16:58.450 line:95%,end
your children are
and your daughter is all week,

00:16:58.517 --> 00:17:00.753 line:95%,end
and we haven't told you to go F yourself.

00:17:01.653 --> 00:17:03.889 line:95%,end
Listen, this is for "The View."

00:17:04.123 --> 00:17:06.325 line:95%,end
Millions and millions of
people are watching that.

00:17:06.625 --> 00:17:08.560 line:95%,end
There will be no mistakes.


00:17:13.465 --> 00:17:14.933 line:5%,start
[music playing]

00:17:18.370 --> 00:17:19.972 line:5%,start
- KELLY: She's here.
- Hey.

00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:21.206 line:5%,start
Hi.

00:17:21.273 --> 00:17:22.141 line:5%,start
Hillary.

00:17:22.207 --> 00:17:23.075 line:95%,end
I'm Brooke.

00:17:23.142 --> 00:17:24.543 line:95%,end
Nice to meet you.

00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:26.111 line:95%,end
Oh, look, we got the keyboard all set up.

00:17:26.178 --> 00:17:27.079 line:95%,end
We're ready to go.

00:17:27.146 --> 00:17:31.817 line:5%,start
Brooke loves to sing, and I feel like this
is a great opportunity for the girls.

00:17:32.051 --> 00:17:33.252 line:95%,end
I mean, we're going to be on "The View,"

00:17:33.318 --> 00:17:35.554 line:95%,end
and I just feel like while I'm
out there in New York City,

00:17:35.621 --> 00:17:39.224 line:95%,end
I want to take advantage
of this and have Brooke go meet

00:17:39.291 --> 00:17:41.360 line:95%,end
with a music producer
and have her, you know,

00:17:41.427 --> 00:17:42.828 line:95%,end
see about doing another song.

00:17:42.995 --> 00:17:45.264 line:95%,end
So before we go, I want to have Brooke

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.833 line:95%,end
meet with a vocal teacher
and have her have a lesson

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:51.270 line:95%,end
so when we go to New York,
she is completely prepared.

00:17:51.336 --> 00:17:54.373 line:95%,end
I just keep telling her this,
being in dance,

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:57.576 line:95%,end
she has a lot of opportunities
to get out there and sing.

00:17:57.643 --> 00:17:59.478 line:95%,end
Absolutely, 100%. Of course.

00:17:59.545 --> 00:18:01.346 line:95%,end
You already have an audience
to your dance.

00:18:01.413 --> 00:18:04.149 line:95%,end
Like you opened that door
for being a fantastic dancer,

00:18:04.216 --> 00:18:07.786 line:95%,end
and now you can branch out
and do other things as well.

00:18:07.853 --> 00:18:11.123 line:95%,end
The hardest part is being
a person who will work hard,

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:12.291 line:95%,end
and you're a hard worker.

00:18:12.357 --> 00:18:14.193 line:95%,end
And so you apply that to your singing,

00:18:14.259 --> 00:18:15.294 line:95%,end
you're going to get stuff out of it.

00:18:22.668 --> 00:18:24.169 line:95%,end
How are you doing?

00:18:24.236 --> 00:18:25.737 line:95%,end
You have to go this weekend.

00:18:25.804 --> 00:18:28.173 line:95%,end
If I leave you at home
and you dance all weekend,

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.509 line:95%,end
what if you get hurt again
and you're not good for New York City?

00:18:30.976 --> 00:18:32.678 line:95%,end
Then Asia's going to be doing "The View."

00:18:33.412 --> 00:18:35.881 line:95%,end
Like right now,
Asia is rehearsing your spot.

00:18:37.716 --> 00:18:40.385 line:5%,start
This is Mackenzie's number,
"The Last Text."

00:18:40.452 --> 00:18:42.087 line:5%,start
She deserves to be in the number.

00:18:49.728 --> 00:18:50.662 line:5%,start
You know, Asia just came up to me

00:18:50.729 --> 00:18:53.899 line:95%,end
and she goes, oh, I'm rehearsing
the group thing for "The View,"

00:18:53.966 --> 00:18:56.802 line:95%,end
but Kenzie had Maddie tell me
that I was out of it

00:18:56.869 --> 00:18:58.036 line:95%,end
because she's perfectly fine.

00:18:58.103 --> 00:19:00.339 line:95%,end
But wait, why would
Maddie go and tell her that?

00:19:00.405 --> 00:19:01.240 line:95%,end
That's not her job.

00:19:01.306 --> 00:19:03.675 line:95%,end
Well, that's what I told her.
I said, Asia, I said just wait.

00:19:03.742 --> 00:19:05.844 line:95%,end
I said it's Abby's decision,
not Melissa's.

00:19:05.911 --> 00:19:06.845 line:95%,end
- Yeah.
- This is her team.

00:19:06.912 --> 00:19:07.946 line:95%,end
It's not Asia's team.

00:19:08.013 --> 00:19:10.415 line:95%,end
I understand, but then let's compete.

00:19:10.482 --> 00:19:13.152 line:95%,end
If Mackenzie can't compete,
then she can't do "The View."

00:19:13.218 --> 00:19:14.052 line:95%,end
I know you want to dance.

00:19:14.119 --> 00:19:16.321 line:5%,start
- I want to dance.
- I know.

00:19:16.421 --> 00:19:18.190 line:5%,start
OK.

00:19:18.257 --> 00:19:20.325 line:5%,start
I don't think Mackenzie should
be taken out of the dance.

00:19:20.392 --> 00:19:21.960 line:95%,end
Mackenzie does a roundoff back handspring.

00:19:22.027 --> 00:19:24.663 line:95%,end
That's all she does,
so she needs to let Mackenzie dance.

00:19:26.698 --> 00:19:30.869 line:95%,end
Tell me, what did you learn from the whole
Maddie/Chloe thing?

00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:34.273 line:95%,end
Maddie, Maddie, Maddie.

00:19:34.339 --> 00:19:37.609 line:95%,end
Take that sadness
and put it into your dancing.

00:19:38.177 --> 00:19:40.379 line:95%,end
Well, the corrections that Maddie gave me,

00:19:40.712 --> 00:19:43.448 line:95%,end
I'm trying to really use them.

00:19:43.515 --> 00:19:44.917 line:95%,end
The whole voting thing,

00:19:44.983 --> 00:19:46.552 line:95%,end
it should have been five people
voting for you

00:19:46.618 --> 00:19:48.120 line:95%,end
and five people voting for Maddie.

00:19:48.187 --> 00:19:49.354 line:95%,end
Like they couldn't decide.

00:19:49.421 --> 00:19:51.790 line:95%,end
So you need to toughen up.

00:19:51.857 --> 00:19:56.128 line:95%,end
You need to get a thick skin,
because this business is ruthless.

00:19:56.195 --> 00:19:58.730 line:5%,start
Chloe wants to be a star, a celebrity.

00:19:58.797 --> 00:20:00.199 line:5%,start
She wants to sign autographs.

00:20:00.265 --> 00:20:02.401 line:95%,end
That is not making her a better dancer.

00:20:02.467 --> 00:20:06.171 line:95%,end
All of those things need to be
put on hold until her dancing

00:20:06.238 --> 00:20:08.240 line:95%,end
is to the level that it should be.

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:11.343 line:5%,start
[music playing]

00:20:16.748 --> 00:20:19.218 line:95%,end
I'm actually really surprised
that Abby is giving Chloe

00:20:19.284 --> 00:20:21.887 line:5%,start
a solo again this week
after the whole voting

00:20:21.954 --> 00:20:23.488 line:5%,start
mishap in the dressing room.

00:20:23.555 --> 00:20:26.325 line:95%,end
I think what really hurt Chloe
more than anything was the fact

00:20:26.391 --> 00:20:29.795 line:95%,end
that her peers, whom she
respects, voted against her.

00:20:30.095 --> 00:20:33.432 line:95%,end
So I'm really glad that Chloe has a chance
to go out and redeem herself.

00:20:33.966 --> 00:20:34.866 line:95%,end
Do you know what this is about?

00:20:34.933 --> 00:20:37.502 line:95%,end
It's about all that we've
been through together.

00:20:37.569 --> 00:20:39.705 line:95%,end
It's about mother,
everything we've been through.

00:20:39.771 --> 00:20:41.540 line:95%,end
Let me tell you about my mama,
she's a bitch.

00:20:41.607 --> 00:20:42.441 line:95%,end
[laughter]

00:20:42.507 --> 00:20:43.875 line:95%,end
The dance teacher hates her.

00:20:44.977 --> 00:20:46.044 line:95%,end
That's true.

00:20:46.111 --> 00:20:47.512 line:95%,end
And her partner in crime.

00:20:48.347 --> 00:20:50.582 line:95%,end
I like that Chloe's solo this week
is called "About Mother."

00:20:50.649 --> 00:20:52.618 line:95%,end
You know, Abby always tries
to make it be a negative thing,

00:20:52.684 --> 00:20:54.386 line:95%,end
but I'm going to look at this as a tribute

00:20:54.453 --> 00:20:55.854 line:95%,end
to my relationship with Chloe,

00:20:55.921 --> 00:20:58.924 line:95%,end
not as a negative thing
about our relationship.

00:21:06.198 --> 00:21:10.502 line:5%,start
Asia and Nia are doing a duet this weekend
entitled "Move You Too."

00:21:10.569 --> 00:21:15.374 line:95%,end
Asia has an over-the-top personality,
especially when she steps out on stage.

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:18.777 line:95%,end
And the only other performer
that I think of is a drag queen.

00:21:18.844 --> 00:21:21.113 line:95%,end
They're just that over the top persona.

00:21:21.179 --> 00:21:24.716 line:95%,end
They're bigger than life,
and that's what I want Nia to be.

Oh, here, Abby's going to do her
drag queen walk.

- Oh, Lord, help us all.
- Watch out.

Point those feet.

00:22:18.603 --> 00:22:20.639 line:5%,start
This is going to be a tough duet
for Nia this week.

00:22:20.706 --> 00:22:23.742 line:5%,start
Not only does she have to match
Asia's facial expressions and her energy,

00:22:23.809 --> 00:22:27.079 line:95%,end
there's an extremely difficult lift
in the middle of the dance.

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:32.851 line:95%,end
Asia, although a small girl,
she's muscular and she's no lightweight.

00:22:32.951 --> 00:22:34.920 line:95%,end
Usually, it's Chloe and Maddie,

00:22:34.986 --> 00:22:36.488 line:95%,end
they compete against each other.

00:22:36.555 --> 00:22:39.524 line:95%,end
Asia and Kenzie, they're not competing
against each other.

00:22:39.591 --> 00:22:43.061 line:95%,end
They're competing against each other
for a spot on "The View,"

00:22:43.362 --> 00:22:45.497 line:95%,end
so yeah, they are competing
against each other.

00:22:45.564 --> 00:22:49.968 line:95%,end
I'm really torn who I think should dance
in the group dance on "The View."

00:22:50.035 --> 00:22:52.170 line:95%,end
I mean, it's not fair to the group

00:22:52.237 --> 00:22:55.040 line:95%,end
to have them practice with Asia
and then at the last second

00:22:55.107 --> 00:22:56.208 line:95%,end
throw in Mackenzie.

00:22:56.274 --> 00:22:59.311 line:95%,end
Is Mackenzie, is she feeling
resentful to Asia?

00:22:59.378 --> 00:23:00.245 line:95%,end
No.

00:23:00.312 --> 00:23:02.180 line:95%,end
Oh, and now Asia is a bully.
Is Asia being a bully?

00:23:02.247 --> 00:23:03.448 line:95%,end
No.

00:23:03.515 --> 00:23:05.450 line:95%,end
I want them to resolve this on their own.

00:23:05.517 --> 00:23:08.720 line:95%,end
OK, but I would like to know
how my child's being a bully.

00:23:10.021 --> 00:23:13.492 line:95%,end
She dropped a block on Mackenzie,
dropped a block on her foot on purpose.

00:23:13.558 --> 00:23:15.193 line:95%,end
I'm like, why would a kid
drop a block on her?

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:18.497 line:95%,end
No, Asia told me that because
she knew that's how it would be relayed.

00:23:18.563 --> 00:23:20.565 line:95%,end
She said Kenzie was walking by.

00:23:20.632 --> 00:23:22.667 line:95%,end
When it dropped,
when she was picking it up,

00:23:22.734 --> 00:23:24.436 line:95%,end
it didn't drop on Kenzie's foot.

00:23:24.503 --> 00:23:26.138 line:95%,end
It hit the side of her foot.

00:23:26.204 --> 00:23:28.673 line:95%,end
I can say a lot of things about Asia.

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:32.744 line:95%,end
I really don't think one of them
would be that she's a bully.

00:23:32.811 --> 00:23:36.615 line:95%,end
I just think Melissa
is trying to think of any excuse

00:23:36.681 --> 00:23:38.617 line:95%,end
to make Asia look bad.

00:23:38.683 --> 00:23:41.920 line:95%,end
My child will not pick up a block
and just throw it on someone's foot.

00:23:41.987 --> 00:23:43.455 line:95%,end
Well, I wouldn't think that.

00:23:44.556 --> 00:23:45.424 line:95%,end
Next.

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:49.227 line:5%,start
Melissa's being passive aggressive
about the "bully" comment.

00:23:49.294 --> 00:23:51.096 line:95%,end
I don't know what she's doing,
but it makes no sense.

00:23:51.163 --> 00:23:52.464 line:95%,end
I'm not going to argue with stupid.

00:23:52.531 --> 00:23:53.498 line:95%,end
I got to ask you something.

00:23:53.565 --> 00:23:56.401 line:95%,end
Asia came up to me
and said the girls told her

00:23:56.468 --> 00:23:59.771 line:95%,end
she's out of the show on "The View"
instead of Abby telling her.

00:23:59.838 --> 00:24:01.406 line:95%,end
Abby said Mackenzie was on "The View."

00:24:01.473 --> 00:24:04.476 line:95%,end
OK, well, I wish there was not
this whole charade about her

00:24:04.543 --> 00:24:06.845 line:95%,end
rehearsing it and then now not in it.

00:24:06.912 --> 00:24:08.280 line:95%,end
Things change all the time, Kristie.

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:11.750 line:95%,end
I think it's safe to say
that Kristie Ray has two sides.

00:24:11.817 --> 00:24:16.121 line:95%,end
She has the,
"I'm so perfect dance mom" side,

00:24:16.221 --> 00:24:18.557 line:95%,end
and then she has the,
"I'm a stage mom bitch."

00:24:18.623 --> 00:24:21.293 line:95%,end
It's not about Asia
not being in the group.

00:24:21.359 --> 00:24:22.894 line:95%,end
It's about this whole charade.

00:24:22.961 --> 00:24:24.196 line:95%,end
- Don't let her rehearse.
- What charade?

00:24:24.262 --> 00:24:25.464 line:95%,end
The charade about the foot.

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:27.065 line:95%,end
What [bleep] is wrong with the foot?

00:24:27.532 --> 00:24:29.234 line:95%,end
There's nothing wrong with it now.
It's fine.

00:24:29.301 --> 00:24:30.869 line:95%,end
OK, then what's the charade?
Compete.

00:24:30.936 --> 00:24:32.571 line:95%,end
She want's to-
She was crying.

00:24:32.637 --> 00:24:34.072 line:95%,end
Get it X-rayed and a doctor's note,

00:24:34.139 --> 00:24:36.475 line:95%,end
with a real doctor's note,
with an X-ray with the written,

00:24:36.541 --> 00:24:38.643 line:95%,end

and saying two weeks rest.

is dancing extremely well today,

our next entry is number 44,

"Move You Too."

00:31:03.661 --> 00:31:05.830 line:95%,end
All of a sudden I hear
the competition announce

00:31:05.897 --> 00:31:07.699 line:95%,end
that the duet is up next,

00:31:07.765 --> 00:31:10.001 line:95%,end

to be 14 numbers between

00:31:10.068 --> 00:31:12.537 line:95%,end
Asia and Nia's duet and Maddie's solo.

00:31:12.871 --> 00:31:16.074 line:95%,end
Asia and Nia never had a chance
to rehearse a duet.

00:31:20.078 --> 00:31:21.613 line:95%,end
They didn't run the duet.

00:31:22.146 --> 00:31:23.481 line:95%,end
I think they ran it backstage.

00:31:23.548 --> 00:31:25.016 line:95%,end
No, they did not.

00:31:25.516 --> 00:31:28.119 line:95%,end
In this duet,
Nia has an extremely difficult lift

00:31:28.186 --> 00:31:30.622 line:95%,end
with Asia where she picks
her up over her head.

00:31:31.089 --> 00:31:33.358 line:95%,end
She hasn't even had a chance
to practice it.

00:31:33.691 --> 00:31:34.759 line:95%,end
They haven't even stretched.

00:31:34.826 --> 00:31:36.694 line:95%,end
They are totally unprepared.


00:31:43.067 --> 00:31:45.069 line:5%,start
The competition skipped ahead to the duet

00:31:45.136 --> 00:31:47.438 line:5%,start
and the girls are totally unprepared.

00:31:47.505 --> 00:31:49.007 line:95%,end
They are totally caught off guard,

00:31:49.073 --> 00:31:51.075 line:95%,end
and there's this extremely difficult lift

00:31:51.142 --> 00:31:52.477 line:95%,end
in the middle of the dance.

00:31:55.613 --> 00:31:57.181 line:5%,start
We didn't even warm up or anything.

00:31:57.248 --> 00:32:03.154 line:5%,start
We didn't practice at all,
and that's not fair to Asia and I.

Way to go, girls.

00:33:07.552 --> 00:33:09.854 line:95%,end
The duet ended up looking pretty good.

00:33:09.921 --> 00:33:10.855 line:95%,end
Was it their best?

00:33:10.922 --> 00:33:15.126 line:95%,end
No, but Nia was able to lift Asia
with no difficulty,

00:33:15.193 --> 00:33:16.828 line:95%,end
so I'm pretty happy with that.

00:33:18.162 --> 00:33:20.431 line:95%,end
What I'm not happy with is with Abby.

00:33:20.498 --> 00:33:22.333 line:95%,end
She was reckless and she totally was

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.002 line:95%,end
unprepared in rehearsing those girls

00:33:24.068 --> 00:33:25.303 line:95%,end
before they went on stage.

00:33:26.904 --> 00:33:29.073 line:95%,end
Holly and Christi
are really upset right now

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:32.510 line:5%,start
because Abby was so busy having
them do their drag queen walks

00:33:32.577 --> 00:33:34.312 line:95%,end
that she forgot to have
them run the dance.

00:33:34.779 --> 00:33:36.314 line:95%,end
I think they did a nice job.

00:33:36.381 --> 00:33:38.950 line:95%,end
I think they could
have been better prepared.

00:33:39.017 --> 00:33:40.618 line:95%,end
- They weren't stretched.
- They weren't stretched.

00:33:40.685 --> 00:33:41.619 line:95%,end
They weren't stretched.

00:33:41.686 --> 00:33:42.687 line:95%,end
I could tell they weren't stretched.

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:45.323 line:95%,end
Being in a costume does not mean
that you're ready to perform.

00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:46.290 line:95%,end
I agree.

00:33:46.357 --> 00:33:49.794 line:95%,end
There was time for the girls to rehearse

00:33:49.861 --> 00:33:51.729 line:95%,end
and she didn't use that time.

00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:54.699 line:95%,end
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:00.471 line:95%,end
What?

00:34:02.006 --> 00:34:04.575 line:95%,end
Who told the girls to go on
if there were like 14 numbers?

00:34:05.143 --> 00:34:05.977 line:95%,end
What?

00:34:06.044 --> 00:34:08.546 line:95%,end
They never practiced in their costume
like everybody else.

00:34:08.613 --> 00:34:10.314 line:95%,end
They didn't even run anything.
They didn't even stretch.

00:34:10.381 --> 00:34:12.183 line:95%,end
Most importantly, they weren't warmed up.

00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:16.421 line:95%,end
Regardless, the ability
to adapt quickly to change,

00:34:16.487 --> 00:34:18.089 line:95%,end
that's- they need to be on that.

00:34:18.156 --> 00:34:19.657 line:95%,end
Because when your kid goes to an audition,

00:34:19.724 --> 00:34:24.929 line:95%,end
they could be number 185,
and 183 and 184 dropped out

00:34:24.996 --> 00:34:26.697 line:95%,end
and your kid's saying,
well, wait a minute.

00:34:26.764 --> 00:34:28.499 line:95%,end
I have six more minutes before I step out

00:34:28.566 --> 00:34:29.967 line:95%,end
there to do my audition.

00:34:30.401 --> 00:34:31.836 line:95%,end
No, you don't.

00:34:31.903 --> 00:34:35.073 line:5%,start
When you're in an audition,
you just need to be ready,

00:34:35.139 --> 00:34:36.774 line:5%,start
and that's a fact.

00:34:37.208 --> 00:34:38.342 line:95%,end
I was worried about the lift.

00:34:38.409 --> 00:34:40.111 line:95%,end
The lift was great.

00:34:40.178 --> 00:34:42.013 line:95%,end
They practiced the lift backstage.

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:44.248 line:95%,end
What else did they do that required
all this warm up?

00:34:44.315 --> 00:34:45.883 line:95%,end
A roundoff back handspring.

00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:48.119 line:95%,end
Well, a back handspring,
since you know everything, Dr. Holly,

00:34:48.186 --> 00:34:49.520 line:95%,end
is done with a straight back.

00:34:49.587 --> 00:34:51.889 line:95%,end
But it's not funny
or cute to throw a kid on stage

00:34:51.956 --> 00:34:53.458 line:95%,end
and them not be warmed up.

00:34:53.524 --> 00:34:55.426 line:95%,end
Once again, Abby deflects the blame

00:34:55.493 --> 00:34:58.362 line:95%,end
and turns this all into a lesson
about being prepared.

00:34:58.429 --> 00:35:01.833 line:95%,end
Regardless, this lesson
could have been disastrous.

00:35:01.899 --> 00:35:04.535 line:95%,end
Abby is lucky the duet
performed as well as they did.

Abby's bold experiment of taking
Maddie out of the group number

00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:22.320 line:95%,end
and using her as an assistant is about
to play out in front of all of us.

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:25.389 line:95%,end
I just hope that this
experiment doesn't blow up

00:35:25.456 --> 00:35:27.024 line:95%,end
in front of all of our faces.

00:35:27.525 --> 00:35:29.227 line:95%,end

All right, game faces on.
Let's go.

00:35:33.498 --> 00:35:35.299 line:95%,end
Maddie, if they don't do well,

00:35:35.766 --> 00:35:37.101 line:95%,end

This is a lesson.

00:35:54.352 --> 00:35:57.121 line:95%,end
This is to say, girls,
you need to be together.

of her eggs in one basket

and she depends on Maddie.

00:36:20.478 --> 00:36:23.915 line:95%,end
And I think that this is their time
to go out and show Abby

00:36:23.981 --> 00:36:25.683 line:95%,end
that we can do this without Maddie.

00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:26.717 line:95%,end

00:40:06.237 --> 00:40:08.672 line:95%,end
and we're going to be on
"The View" doing "The Last Text."

00:40:09.206 --> 00:40:12.977 line:95%,end
So I need these kids to run
that number at every opportunity.

00:40:13.043 --> 00:40:16.347 line:95%,end
I need to look at this routine,
and I need to look at it now.

00:40:16.947 --> 00:40:18.082 line:95%,end
Sickle feet.

00:40:18.149 --> 00:40:20.451 line:95%,end
You do that,
I will literally grab that hand

00:40:20.518 --> 00:40:22.052 line:95%,end
and drag you off the stage.

00:40:22.653 --> 00:40:24.955 line:95%,end
Is it clear that she's
going to be on "The View,"

00:40:25.022 --> 00:40:25.890 line:95%,end
or should I--

00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:28.626 line:95%,end
- You never know.
- Asia's been running the dance.

00:40:28.692 --> 00:40:30.261 line:95%,end
She's been rehearsing.
She knows the part.

00:40:30.327 --> 00:40:32.463 line:95%,end
So at this point, I think
Asia should be on "The View."

00:40:32.897 --> 00:40:35.266 line:95%,end
Does that mean Asia's doing
"The Last Text?"

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:36.867 line:95%,end
Mackenzie's definitely bummed.

00:40:36.934 --> 00:40:38.135 line:5%,start
She wants to dance.

00:40:38.903 --> 00:40:40.671 line:5%,start
She wants to dance in the worst way.

00:40:41.872 --> 00:40:42.907 line:95%,end
We'll see.

00:40:47.378 --> 00:40:49.780 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER (VOICEOVER):
Next on "Dance Moms."

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:52.450 line:5%,start
Here we are, New York City.

00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:55.486 line:5%,start
[inaudible]

00:40:55.553 --> 00:40:57.188 line:5%,start
Oh.

00:40:57.254 --> 00:40:58.889 line:5%,start
What do I have to do to
get Mackenzie to dance again?

00:40:58.956 --> 00:41:00.991 line:5%,start
I really think that she
needs to go on "The View."

00:41:01.525 --> 00:41:03.627 line:5%,start
We are holding an open audition

00:41:03.694 --> 00:41:05.930 line:5%,start
for a contemporary dancer.

00:41:05.996 --> 00:41:07.665 line:5%,start
I danced with Mariah Carey.

00:41:07.731 --> 00:41:08.732 line:5%,start
Wow.

00:41:08.799 --> 00:41:09.767 line:5%,start
Who's going to be in the dance?

00:41:09.834 --> 00:41:10.835 line:5%,start
I'm not sure yet.

00:41:10.901 --> 00:41:12.369 line:5%,start
I have to fight for my daughter.

00:41:12.436 --> 00:41:13.938 line:5%,start
Let it die.

00:41:14.839 --> 00:41:15.940 line:5%,start
This is my decision.
