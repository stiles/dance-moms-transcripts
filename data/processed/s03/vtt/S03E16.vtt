ABBY (VOICEOVER):
Previously on "Dance Moms"--

00:00:02.602 --> 00:00:04.204 line:5%,start
We have a new member of the team.

00:00:04.537 --> 00:00:07.340 line:5%,start
Asia will be joining
the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:00:07.407 --> 00:00:10.176 line:5%,start
I do not think there is enough
competition among you.

00:00:10.243 --> 00:00:11.911 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: Well, doesn't it make you
nervous at all

00:00:11.978 --> 00:00:15.115 line:5%,start
that last week Abby really
didn't want Kenzie to do the group,

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:18.351 line:5%,start
and then this week she brings in someone
that's her age and gives her a solo?

00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:23.790 line:5%,start
The top Energy Junior Small Group
is entry 124-A,

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:24.858 line:5%,start
"Machine Lines."

00:00:24.924 --> 00:00:27.127 line:5%,start
[cheering and applause]

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:31.197 line:5%,start
ABBY: Do you think I've given up my whole
life to deal with that piece of crap?

00:00:31.264 --> 00:00:32.098 line:5%,start
No!

00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:34.034 line:5%,start
She is dirt under my feet!

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:36.736 line:5%,start
ABBY (VOICEOVER):
Coming up on "Dance Moms"--

00:00:36.836 --> 00:00:38.471 line:5%,start
We're doing a patriotic number.

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:40.573 line:5%,start
This is about the politics--

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.975 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: Of dance.
- --of dance.

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:43.009 line:5%,start
ABBY: Politics is life.

00:00:43.076 --> 00:00:44.310 line:5%,start
It is about who you know.

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:47.380 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: Maddie and Chloe are competing
against each other at this competition.

00:00:47.447 --> 00:00:49.949 line:5%,start
ABBY: Now you realize
you're up against Chloe.

00:00:50.016 --> 00:00:51.751 line:5%,start
I mean, Asia comes in from out of town--

00:00:51.818 --> 00:00:53.486 line:5%,start
what do I do with Asia--

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:55.155 line:5%,start
right when Mackenzie is injured.

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:57.524 line:5%,start
She doesn't want to
let Asia take her spot.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.060 line:5%,start
Kendall, you're chasing her!

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.327 line:5%,start
The kid is a brat!

00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:03.530 line:5%,start
There are brats in there,
and Kendall's not one of them!

00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:05.098 line:5%,start
HOLLY: I don't care what you
say or what you don't say,

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:07.367 line:5%,start
so let's get that clear.

00:01:07.434 --> 00:01:10.503 line:5%,start
ABBY: Today you will be
voting on Maddie or Chloe.

00:01:11.504 --> 00:01:12.705 line:5%,start
May the best man win.

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:14.340 line:95%,end
[theme music]

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:16.176 line:95%,end
(SINGING) Get up!

00:01:16.776 --> 00:01:18.645 line:95%,end
Get on the floor!

00:01:18.711 --> 00:01:24.884 line:95%,end
My world is with my girls,
living on the dance floor.

00:01:25.218 --> 00:01:28.188 line:5%,start
[music playing]

00:01:31.691 --> 00:01:34.027 line:95%,end
Well, look at you, the first one in.

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:38.898 line:95%,end
Wow. I love that your child and you
are the first ones in the door.

00:01:39.332 --> 00:01:40.467 line:5%,start
JILL: I don't like Kristie Rae.

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:42.902 line:5%,start
She's been here just
a short period of time,

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:46.272 line:5%,start
and she's already positioning
herself to be Abby's favorite.

00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:47.774 line:95%,end
ABBY: Congratulations, Asia.

00:01:47.874 --> 00:01:51.611 line:95%,end
It was your first time competing
with the Abby Lee Dance Company,

00:01:51.678 --> 00:01:53.279 line:95%,end
and you were the big winner.

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:55.949 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:01:57.083 --> 00:01:57.917 line:95%,end
All right.

00:01:57.984 --> 00:02:01.321 line:5%,start
Last week, Cathy got
the only perfect score given.

00:02:01.421 --> 00:02:02.989 line:5%,start
It was horrible.

00:02:03.089 --> 00:02:07.594 line:5%,start
How come four strangers
that don't dance together

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.331 line:95%,end
on a daily basis, that aren't
taught by the same teacher,

00:02:11.431 --> 00:02:14.834 line:95%,end
come together and tell the story
and connect with each other?

00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:17.470 line:5%,start
[music playing]

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:24.844 line:95%,end
You're all together every single day.

00:02:24.944 --> 00:02:27.147 line:95%,end
I didn't see that connection.

00:02:27.247 --> 00:02:29.349 line:95%,end
I don't think some of you want to be here.

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:33.153 line:95%,end
And I certainly don't think
any of you work hard enough.

00:02:36.523 --> 00:02:37.790 line:95%,end
The pyramid today--

00:02:39.526 --> 00:02:40.360 line:95%,end
first,

00:02:41.494 --> 00:02:42.595 line:95%,end
Mackenzie.

00:02:43.062 --> 00:02:45.131 line:95%,end
Mackenzie, you're injured.

00:02:45.198 --> 00:02:46.733 line:95%,end
You didn't dance. You stayed home.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.868 line:5%,start
MELISSA: Mackenzie hurt her foot.

00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:50.503 line:5%,start
She just has an overuse injury.

00:02:50.603 --> 00:02:51.771 line:5%,start
She just has to rest.

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:52.772 line:95%,end
And next,

00:02:53.773 --> 00:02:54.807 line:95%,end
we have Brooke.

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.211 line:95%,end
You are 15 years old.

00:02:58.311 --> 00:02:59.512 line:95%,end
We all make choices.

00:02:59.612 --> 00:03:02.482 line:95%,end
If you want to work hard,
you'll get better.

00:03:03.616 --> 00:03:05.952 line:95%,end
Next, Chloe.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.322 line:95%,end
Chloe, you were part of a trio.

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:10.423 line:95%,end
That trio should have won.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:11.324 line:5%,start
[music playing]

00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:12.492 line:5%,start
It was second.

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:14.127 line:5%,start
You fell out of the turns early.

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:16.129 line:5%,start
You hit the floor before everybody else.

00:03:16.663 --> 00:03:19.065 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: I think the only way
that Chloe will ever make it to the top

00:03:19.132 --> 00:03:22.869 line:5%,start
of the pyramid again is if she
may be reincarnates as Anna Pavlova.

00:03:22.936 --> 00:03:23.803 line:95%,end
And next,

00:03:25.104 --> 00:03:26.439 line:95%,end
Kendall.

00:03:26.506 --> 00:03:29.409 line:95%,end
You were also part
of a trio that came in second.

00:03:30.843 --> 00:03:32.312 line:95%,end
And now,

00:03:32.378 --> 00:03:33.446 line:95%,end
Maddie.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.950 line:95%,end
Maddie, you were a part of the trio, too.

00:03:37.483 --> 00:03:38.585 line:95%,end
What went wrong?

00:03:39.586 --> 00:03:41.554 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Maddie's fourth
on the pyramid and Abby said,

00:03:41.654 --> 00:03:44.290 line:95%,end
you know, you were
part of the losing trio.

00:03:44.357 --> 00:03:45.992 line:95%,end
I thought they were fabulous.

00:03:47.026 --> 00:03:47.927 line:95%,end
Next,


00:03:49.095 --> 00:03:50.530 line:95%,end
Paige.

00:03:50.763 --> 00:03:53.066 line:5%,start
KELLY: I'm glad that Paige
is moving her way up the pyramid.

00:03:53.132 --> 00:03:56.336 line:5%,start
With me behaving myself
and not fighting with Abby,

00:03:56.402 --> 00:03:58.004 line:95%,end
it's paying off for my kids.

00:03:58.071 --> 00:04:00.773 line:95%,end
Paige, if I give you the responsibility

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.208 line:95%,end
to be part of the group number,

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.612 line:95%,end
then work harder.

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:07.580 line:95%,end
And next

00:04:09.015 --> 00:04:10.049 line:95%,end
I have Nia.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.652 line:95%,end
Nia, you've been flying under the radar.

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:18.091 line:95%,end
You're here because you're
like Switzerland.

00:04:19.158 --> 00:04:20.793 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Being second on
the pyramid is a big deal.

00:04:20.893 --> 00:04:23.997 line:95%,end
And I think Abby stole Nia's joy
by saying she got it

00:04:24.063 --> 00:04:25.932 line:95%,end
by flying under the radar.

00:04:26.032 --> 00:04:28.301 line:95%,end
I mean, that's defeating.

00:04:28.701 --> 00:04:31.871 line:95%,end
And next, on top of the pyramid, is Asia.

00:04:32.138 --> 00:04:34.707 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:38.044 line:95%,end
ABBY: Asia, you were our big winner.

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:40.146 line:95%,end
This is a reflection of your score,

00:04:41.447 --> 00:04:43.716 line:95%,end
not your legs or your feet.

00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:49.455 line:95%,end
Those things all need a lot of attention.

00:04:50.723 --> 00:04:51.924 line:95%,end
Understood?

00:04:52.725 --> 00:04:56.229 line:5%,start
KRISTIE: This week, Asia brought it
and now we're on top of the pyramid.

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:57.764 line:5%,start
Mackenzie, what's wrong?

00:04:59.465 --> 00:05:00.800 line:5%,start
ABBY: You feel dizzy?

00:05:00.867 --> 00:05:02.468 line:95%,end
All right.
Why don't you take a seat?

00:05:02.535 --> 00:05:03.736 line:95%,end
OK?

00:05:03.803 --> 00:05:05.138 line:95%,end
You want to keep that foot up.

00:05:06.506 --> 00:05:08.608 line:95%,end
Mackenzie has to stay off of her foot.

00:05:09.776 --> 00:05:11.244 line:95%,end
And you were her opposite,

00:05:12.178 --> 00:05:13.946 line:95%,end
and now you don't have an opposite.

00:05:14.013 --> 00:05:16.816 line:95%,end
So what do I do with Asia?

00:05:16.916 --> 00:05:20.520 line:95%,end
JILL: Asia and Mackenzie are so much
smaller than everybody else on this team,

00:05:20.586 --> 00:05:25.224 line:95%,end
that they both need to be in this group
number to offset one another.

00:05:25.291 --> 00:05:27.927 line:95%,end
They're both like two
cute little bookends.

00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:29.862 line:95%,end
ABBY: So you're going
to come into the group

00:05:29.929 --> 00:05:31.130 line:95%,end
and you're going to learn it.

00:05:31.197 --> 00:05:32.732 line:95%,end
But I don't know if you're in it or not.

00:05:32.799 --> 00:05:35.501 line:95%,end
KRISTIE: It's unfortunate
that Kenzie's hurt right now.

00:05:35.568 --> 00:05:38.471 line:95%,end
So I'm waiting patiently to see
if she's going to get a chance

00:05:38.538 --> 00:05:39.672 line:95%,end
to be in this group this week.

00:05:39.739 --> 00:05:41.674 line:95%,end
We're doing a patriotic number.

00:05:42.141 --> 00:05:45.144 line:95%,end
It's called "Free the People."

00:05:45.645 --> 00:05:48.848 line:95%,end
We have the conservatives
and the liberals.

00:05:48.948 --> 00:05:52.085 line:5%,start
Clearly, the Abby Lee Dance Company
is not a democracy.

00:05:52.151 --> 00:05:53.653 line:5%,start
Abby is a totalitarianist.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.256 line:95%,end
Now, this week we're
going to Philadelphia.

00:05:57.323 --> 00:06:00.693 line:95%,end
We are attending
Powerhouse Dance Competition.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.597 line:95%,end
After last weekend,
I need to put my best foot forward.

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:09.369 line:95%,end
This whole fair thing,
with trying to spread it all around,

00:06:10.002 --> 00:06:11.003 line:95%,end
no.

00:06:11.471 --> 00:06:13.172 line:95%,end
Obviously, Asia,

00:06:13.573 --> 00:06:14.540 line:95%,end
you get another solo.

00:06:17.043 --> 00:06:20.980 line:95%,end
The name of your solo is "Ready for War."

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:24.417 line:95%,end
So, Maddie, you have
another solo this week.

00:06:24.517 --> 00:06:28.187 line:95%,end
I think it's strange that Paige
is higher than Maddie on the pyramid,

00:06:28.254 --> 00:06:30.990 line:95%,end
but yet Maddie gets the solo
and Paige doesn't.

00:06:31.424 --> 00:06:35.128 line:95%,end
The name of your song is "I'm Trying."

00:06:36.596 --> 00:06:40.466 line:95%,end
Chloe, you will be doing a solo this week.

00:06:41.801 --> 00:06:45.204 line:95%,end
The name of your routine is
"Am I Here to Stay?"

00:06:46.472 --> 00:06:48.274 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Maddie and Chloe
are competing against each other.

00:06:48.341 --> 00:06:52.078 line:95%,end
And this is the first time in months
these two are going to go head-to-head.

00:06:52.178 --> 00:06:54.080 line:95%,end
JILL: Maddie is the consistent winner,

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.716 line:95%,end
but I know Chloe is really hungry to win.

00:06:56.783 --> 00:06:59.819 line:95%,end
With their rivalry, anything could happen.

00:06:59.886 --> 00:07:01.954 line:95%,end
ABBY: All right.
Moms, you're dismissed.

00:07:02.021 --> 00:07:04.056 line:95%,end
Girls, spread apart. Let's warm up.

00:07:07.026 --> 00:07:08.361 line:95%,end
Go ahead.

00:07:08.461 --> 00:07:10.129 line:95%,end
Come here, girls.

00:07:10.196 --> 00:07:13.232 line:95%,end
So why did Mackenzie start crying, though,

00:07:13.299 --> 00:07:15.234 line:95%,end
all of a sudden, in the middle of pyramid?

00:07:15.301 --> 00:07:17.036 line:95%,end
Did you notice the timing?

00:07:19.705 --> 00:07:20.940 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Oh.

00:07:21.007 --> 00:07:23.776 line:95%,end
KELLY: Mackenzie started crying
as soon as Asia was announced

00:07:23.876 --> 00:07:25.578 line:95%,end
that she was at the top of the pyramid.

00:07:25.645 --> 00:07:26.612 line:95%,end
I think she's intimidated.

00:07:26.679 --> 00:07:28.815 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: It didn't even
register on my radar.

00:07:28.915 --> 00:07:31.617 line:95%,end
Melissa's daughters can't be out-danced.

00:07:31.717 --> 00:07:35.421 line:95%,end
So rather than have Asia
and Mackenzie go head-to-head,

00:07:35.488 --> 00:07:37.423 line:95%,end
Melissa pulls Kenzie from the dance.


00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:38.624 line:95%,end
Smart, Melissa.

00:07:38.724 --> 00:07:43.563 line:95%,end
ABBY: So this is loosely
based on the political system.

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:45.798 line:95%,end
Every time we go to a dance competition

00:07:45.898 --> 00:07:48.468 line:95%,end
I hear people toss around the saying,

00:07:48.568 --> 00:07:49.969 line:95%,end
"Well, this is political.

00:07:50.036 --> 00:07:52.939 line:95%,end
Oh, well, she's going to win
because it's all politics,

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:55.408 line:95%,end
that it's maybe me who you know."

00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:58.211 line:95%,end
Well, then I guess politics is life.

00:07:59.245 --> 00:08:01.013 line:95%,end
Because it is about who you know.

00:08:01.814 --> 00:08:04.016 line:95%,end
Hey, whatever it takes. Right?

00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:05.451 line:95%,end
[laughter]

00:08:05.518 --> 00:08:07.086 line:95%,end
- That's what this is about.
- That is true.

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:08.855 line:95%,end
This is about politics--

00:08:08.955 --> 00:08:10.756 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Of dance.
--of dance.

00:08:10.823 --> 00:08:13.125 line:95%,end
The ALDC is very political.

00:08:13.192 --> 00:08:16.762 line:95%,end
We are all campaigning all the time
to keep our daughters on top.

00:08:17.396 --> 00:08:20.366 line:95%,end
(SINGING) I can feel it--

00:08:20.466 --> 00:08:23.669 line:95%,end
ABBY: This week we're who a routine called
"Free the People."

00:08:23.769 --> 00:08:28.174 line:95%,end
It's a big patriotic number,
and I think it's important for kids today

00:08:28.241 --> 00:08:30.510 line:95%,end
to realize that they have a voice.

00:08:31.477 --> 00:08:33.246 line:95%,end
Asia, pay attention to what they're doing.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:35.748 line:95%,end
Yes? I just gave you that one step
to work on,

00:08:35.815 --> 00:08:37.350 line:95%,end
but you need to pay attention
to this group.

00:08:37.416 --> 00:08:39.952 line:95%,end
Originally, this routine had four girls

00:08:40.019 --> 00:08:44.290 line:95%,end
on the conservative side
and four girls on the liberal side.

00:08:44.357 --> 00:08:46.125 line:95%,end
And with that, I'm going to let you go.

00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:49.195 line:95%,end
But with Mackenzie out on injured reserve,

00:08:49.295 --> 00:08:51.230 line:95%,end
I don't know what to do with Asia.

00:08:51.297 --> 00:08:53.866 line:95%,end
So I put Asia to work on her solo.

00:08:54.333 --> 00:08:56.702 line:95%,end
Rosie the Riveter. Say that.

00:08:56.802 --> 00:08:57.870 line:95%,end
Rosie the Riveter.

00:08:57.970 --> 00:08:59.572 line:95%,end
Do you know who that is?

00:08:59.639 --> 00:09:01.374 line:95%,end
Yeah. She's going to be Rosie the Riveter.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.575 line:95%,end
Rosa what?

00:09:02.642 --> 00:09:03.676 line:95%,end
Rosie the Riveter.

00:09:03.743 --> 00:09:06.445 line:95%,end
You know, the girl from war war ads.

00:09:06.913 --> 00:09:08.514 line:95%,end
So you need to be strong.

00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:09.649 line:95%,end
Give me the arm.

00:09:10.316 --> 00:09:12.318 line:95%,end
Woo! Look at that.

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:15.488 line:95%,end
Asia is doing a hot, sassy, jazz routine

00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:18.457 line:95%,end
it's called "Ready for War,"
and it's based on the character

00:09:18.524 --> 00:09:19.358 line:95%,end
Rosie the Riveter.

00:09:19.425 --> 00:09:20.426 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:09:20.493 --> 00:09:21.928 line:95%,end
Five, six,

00:09:22.762 --> 00:09:24.063 line:95%,end
seven, eight.

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:28.701 line:95%,end
Just keep it--
head and head and head and head.

00:09:28.768 --> 00:09:32.572 line:95%,end
Yes. I think Asia,
she could have been Rosie the Riveter.

00:09:32.638 --> 00:09:35.041 line:95%,end
She is one tough cookie.

00:09:35.107 --> 00:09:36.175 line:95%,end
All right, you're finished.

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:37.443 line:95%,end
I'm going to let you go, Rosie.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:38.945 line:95%,end
Send in your co-worker.

00:09:42.048 --> 00:09:43.416 line:95%,end
OK, Chloe.

00:09:43.816 --> 00:09:47.520 line:95%,end
Chloe, the name
of this is "Am I Here to Stay?"

00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:49.789 line:95%,end
I mean, really, are you here to stay?

00:09:49.889 --> 00:09:52.558 line:95%,end
Are you going to come out
an amazing dancer?

00:09:52.625 --> 00:09:54.093 line:95%,end
Time will tell.

00:09:54.193 --> 00:09:56.462 line:95%,end
Chloe is holding a national title.

00:09:56.562 --> 00:09:59.298 line:95%,end
She needs to dig down deep to beat Maddie.

00:09:59.398 --> 00:10:00.366 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:04.270 line:95%,end
(MUSIC PLAYING) Every time
I think about the day you left me here,

00:10:04.337 --> 00:10:06.639 line:95%,end
I feel so cold inside.

00:10:06.706 --> 00:10:08.040 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Chloe is the underdog.

00:10:08.107 --> 00:10:11.077 line:95%,end
Abby plays favorites,
and Chloe is certainly not one of them.

00:10:11.143 --> 00:10:12.678 line:95%,end
OK, Chloe, that's all we're going to do.

00:10:12.745 --> 00:10:14.547 line:95%,end
And, like, let that really hang.

00:10:16.082 --> 00:10:17.917 line:95%,end
And then you can get straight again.

00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:21.587 line:95%,end
Nice. Better.

00:10:21.654 --> 00:10:23.623 line:95%,end
All right. Chloe, that's it.
We have to wrap it up.

00:10:23.689 --> 00:10:24.957 line:95%,end
I'll see you tomorrow.

00:10:25.057 --> 00:10:26.025 line:95%,end
All right, good night.

[music playing]

00:10:29.061 --> 00:10:32.331 line:95%,end
All right, Maddie.
Maddie has a solo titled "I'm Trying."

00:10:32.398 --> 00:10:36.102 line:95%,end
She is trying to be
the overall first place high score.

00:10:36.168 --> 00:10:38.337 line:95%,end
Chloe is holding a national title.

00:10:38.437 --> 00:10:40.439 line:95%,end
That's all Maddie wants.

00:10:40.506 --> 00:10:42.708 line:95%,end
So is Chloe and Maddie compared a lot?

00:10:42.775 --> 00:10:44.210 line:95%,end
Is that how it works?

00:10:44.276 --> 00:10:45.811 line:95%,end
Last year it was, yes.

00:10:45.878 --> 00:10:46.879 line:95%,end
JILL: They're her stars.

00:10:46.946 --> 00:10:48.314 line:95%,end
They score the highest.

00:10:48.614 --> 00:10:50.883 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Abby doesn't give Chloe
a whole lot of credit any longer.

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:52.251 line:95%,end
Why do you think that is?

00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:53.753 line:95%,end
Because Abby hates me.

00:10:53.819 --> 00:10:56.922 line:95%,end
But, see, I think she gives Chloe
a ton of opportunities.

00:10:56.989 --> 00:10:58.424 line:95%,end
I swear, I do.

00:10:58.491 --> 00:11:00.426 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Abby's making it clear
that the pressure's on Chloe

00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:01.761 line:95%,end
to beat Maddie this week.

00:11:01.827 --> 00:11:03.763 line:95%,end
Clearly, she's not on the
same level plane field

00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:05.598 line:95%,end
because Christi's not Melissa.

00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:09.869 line:95%,end
Now you realize you're up against Chloe.

00:11:09.969 --> 00:11:11.737 line:95%,end
JILL: At this point, it's anybody's game.

00:11:11.804 --> 00:11:14.807 line:95%,end
And nothing is scarier than
a dance mom under pressure.

00:11:14.874 --> 00:11:19.278 line:95%,end
ABBY: Remember, sometimes
people play dirty when they're

00:11:19.345 --> 00:11:21.180 line:95%,end
talking about politics.

You have to do your homework, Mad.

No. I don't want to.

00:11:38.964 --> 00:11:40.032 line:95%,end
I know, honey, but--

00:11:40.132 --> 00:11:41.734 line:95%,end
you're going to go to dance, but you
have to have your homework finished first.

00:11:41.834 --> 00:11:45.071 line:95%,end
I know. But can't we just got to, like,
dance early and I'll do that later?

00:11:46.138 --> 00:11:47.473 line:95%,end
You could do it on the way.

00:11:47.973 --> 00:11:49.975 line:5%,start
I'm thinking of homeschooling
Maddie and Mackenzie

00:11:50.042 --> 00:11:52.044 line:5%,start
because they can do a lot more.

00:11:52.144 --> 00:11:53.646 line:95%,end
They can dance more.

00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:55.047 line:95%,end
They can take voice and piano.

00:11:55.147 --> 00:11:58.918 line:95%,end
And, you know, kids have more
time to-- for themselves.

00:11:58.984 --> 00:12:01.687 line:95%,end
I have Tracy coming over
to talk to you guys.

00:12:01.754 --> 00:12:02.722 line:95%,end
You know, if we do the homeschooling,

00:12:02.822 --> 00:12:06.926 line:95%,end
then you guys can dance more, you know,
and really do what you want to do.

00:12:06.992 --> 00:12:08.327 line:95%,end
- OK?
- OK.

00:12:08.961 --> 00:12:11.931 line:5%,start
I really want to homeschool,
even though my mom says

00:12:11.997 --> 00:12:14.100 line:95%,end
that school comes before dance.

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.936 line:95%,end
I say that dance comes before school.

00:12:25.978 --> 00:12:26.812 line:95%,end

TRACY: Good.

00:12:26.879 --> 00:12:27.847 line:95%,end
How are you?

00:12:27.913 --> 00:12:28.981 line:95%,end
- Thank you.
- Come on.

00:12:29.048 --> 00:12:31.717 line:95%,end
I've been doing a lot of
research about homeschooling.

00:12:31.784 --> 00:12:35.888 line:95%,end
I've spoken to a few tutors
that would actually teach my girls.

00:12:35.955 --> 00:12:38.390 line:95%,end
And we're just going to see
what happens at this point.

00:12:38.457 --> 00:12:40.893 line:95%,end
I was explaining to the girls
that I spoke to you,

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.595 line:95%,end
you know, about homeschooling them.

00:12:42.661 --> 00:12:45.197 line:95%,end
And I explained to them that they
have to go to school every day,

00:12:45.264 --> 00:12:46.999 line:95%,end
you know, and that's the law.

00:12:47.066 --> 00:12:48.701 line:5%,start
Yeah. With homeschooling,
you do everything

00:12:48.768 --> 00:12:52.004 line:5%,start
that you would do in school--
all the same subjects, everything.

00:12:52.071 --> 00:12:54.306 line:95%,end
It's about four to five hours a day,

00:12:54.373 --> 00:12:58.511 line:95%,end
so you have extra time
to do more things, like dance.

00:12:58.577 --> 00:12:59.912 line:95%,end
They both want to do it.

00:12:59.979 --> 00:13:01.614 line:95%,end
You know, Mackenzie wants to--

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.549 line:95%,end
she wants to really step
it up with her dancing.

00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:05.551 line:95%,end
But I'll miss my school friends.

00:13:05.618 --> 00:13:07.253 line:95%,end
I know. You have your best friend there,
huh?

00:13:07.319 --> 00:13:10.623 line:95%,end
MACKENZIE: I want to be homeschooled,
but I'll miss my friends.

00:13:10.689 --> 00:13:16.128 line:95%,end
TRACY: I suggest maybe me and you going
to a meeting with one of the counselors.

00:13:16.195 --> 00:13:18.297 line:95%,end
MELISSA: This sounds good,
so we're going to move forward.

00:13:18.364 --> 00:13:20.399 line:95%,end
OK, girls, we got to go get ready
for dance.

00:13:20.466 --> 00:13:21.901 line:95%,end
Thank Tracy for coming.

00:13:21.967 --> 00:13:22.968 line:95%,end
Thank you.

00:13:23.035 --> 00:13:24.203 line:95%,end
You're welcome, girls.

[music playing]

Well, I'm excited for your solo.

00:13:32.611 --> 00:13:34.980 line:5%,start
It's been a really long,
rough road for Chloe.

00:13:35.047 --> 00:13:38.617 line:95%,end
Because Abby has said that she
no longer is at Maddie's level,

00:13:38.684 --> 00:13:41.153 line:95%,end
and that she can't keep up,
and she's regressed.

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:45.124 line:95%,end
So I'm really happy to see Chloe
given the opportunity to prove

00:13:45.191 --> 00:13:46.926 line:95%,end
that none of that is true.

00:13:46.992 --> 00:13:48.460 line:95%,end
Come on, girls!
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

00:13:48.527 --> 00:13:50.029 line:95%,end
You should be ready!

00:13:50.129 --> 00:13:52.331 line:5%,start
The routine is a big hot mess right now.

00:13:52.431 --> 00:13:54.366 line:95%,end
But once I get Asia in this number,

00:13:54.433 --> 00:13:55.968 line:95%,end
I think it's going to come together.

00:13:56.035 --> 00:13:58.470 line:95%,end
We're going to start
the dance where we left off.

00:13:58.537 --> 00:14:01.106 line:95%,end
I figured out what I'm
going to do with you, Asia.

00:14:01.173 --> 00:14:04.310 line:95%,end
I don't like to throw kids
out in the end of the numbers,

00:14:04.376 --> 00:14:08.047 line:95%,end
but I think this will be inspirational.

00:14:08.147 --> 00:14:09.882 line:95%,end
I think the audience will love it.

00:14:09.982 --> 00:14:15.955 line:95%,end
And I am going to have you come running
onto the stage with the American flag.

00:14:16.021 --> 00:14:18.824 line:95%,end
I want to use Asia
in this patriotic number

00:14:18.891 --> 00:14:20.826 line:95%,end
because she's a little firecracker.

00:14:20.893 --> 00:14:23.295 line:95%,end
So I decided to let Asia carry the flag.

00:14:23.362 --> 00:14:24.797 line:95%,end
Now, this is very important.

00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:27.199 line:95%,end
A flag it's never supposed
to touch the ground.

00:14:27.266 --> 00:14:30.002 line:95%,end
You need to be careful
that it never touches the ground.

00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:35.007 line:95%,end
I met with a tutor today, you know,
just asking questions about homeschooling.

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:39.378 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I don't know if I'm doing it yet.
JILL: You find a tutor--

00:14:39.445 --> 00:14:40.846 line:95%,end
I still don't know if I'm doing it yet.

00:14:40.913 --> 00:14:43.082 line:95%,end
Do you want them to get more dance class?

00:14:43.148 --> 00:14:44.550 line:95%,end
Totally.

00:14:44.617 --> 00:14:47.453 line:5%,start
KELLY: I think the only reason
Melissa's pulling her kids out of school

00:14:47.519 --> 00:14:50.055 line:5%,start
is to get them ahead in the dance world.

00:14:50.155 --> 00:14:52.024 line:95%,end
And that's a crock of [bleep].

00:14:52.091 --> 00:14:53.425 line:95%,end
I'm definitely going to do it next year.

00:14:53.525 --> 00:14:56.695 line:95%,end
I mean, it's a definite for next year,
no question.

00:14:56.762 --> 00:14:59.098 line:95%,end
Maddie and Mackenzie want to homeschool.

00:14:59.164 --> 00:15:00.165 line:95%,end
They want more time.

00:15:00.232 --> 00:15:01.867 line:95%,end
They can dance more.

00:15:01.934 --> 00:15:04.870 line:95%,end
They'll be able to sleep
another hour in the morning.

00:15:04.937 --> 00:15:10.009 line:95%,end
What do you want out of this experience
that the school can't provide you?

00:15:10.075 --> 00:15:11.510 line:95%,end
Mackenzie's going to take piano.

00:15:11.577 --> 00:15:14.847 line:95%,end
Like-- like, it'll be fun for her to take
a piano class. You know?

00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:16.181 line:95%,end
Like, I might take piano.

00:15:16.248 --> 00:15:17.516 line:5%,start
I know Melissa will do anything

00:15:17.583 --> 00:15:19.785 line:5%,start
to make sure that her
daughters are the best dancers.

00:15:19.885 --> 00:15:22.421 line:95%,end
But taking your kids out of school
is really serious,

00:15:22.488 --> 00:15:25.457 line:95%,end
and I'm not sure that Melissa is
doing it for the right reasons.

00:15:25.524 --> 00:15:27.493 line:95%,end
School is not just about busy work.

00:15:27.559 --> 00:15:30.095 line:95%,end
It's about can you think.

00:15:30.195 --> 00:15:33.265 line:95%,end
Can you be a citizen of the world
and think for yourself?

00:15:33.365 --> 00:15:34.833 line:95%,end
I just really agree with Holly.

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:35.868 line:95%,end
I really do.

00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:39.071 line:5%,start
Isn't our role as a parent to make sure
our children grow up educated?

00:15:39.138 --> 00:15:41.273 line:5%,start
The only thing Maddie's
going to know is a tendu!

00:15:41.373 --> 00:15:44.710 line:95%,end
These are hard questions because your child
gets one chance at education.

00:15:46.612 --> 00:15:47.947 line:95%,end
Run again for me. Run.

00:15:48.013 --> 00:15:50.649 line:95%,end
(SINGING) Something's coming.

00:15:51.483 --> 00:15:52.885 line:95%,end
I can feel it.

00:15:52.952 --> 00:15:54.119 line:95%,end
- Is that her part?
- [laughs]

00:15:54.219 --> 00:15:55.521 line:95%,end
She runs across the back?

00:15:55.587 --> 00:15:56.989 line:95%,end
Come on. Chase her!

00:15:58.857 --> 00:16:01.260 line:95%,end
That looks really bad.
Don't you think?

00:16:01.794 --> 00:16:04.496 line:95%,end
Well, I just think she's
too short to hold the flag.

00:16:04.563 --> 00:16:08.000 line:95%,end
Now run. Now do your grand jetÃ©,
then keep going.

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:10.135 line:95%,end
[laughter]

00:16:10.235 --> 00:16:12.338 line:95%,end
Asia just runs through with the flag.

00:16:12.404 --> 00:16:15.774 line:95%,end
Like, this-- is this the Olympics
and did you just win the marathon?

00:16:15.841 --> 00:16:19.778 line:95%,end
I think this makes Asia look
like she can't do anything.

00:16:21.013 --> 00:16:23.515 line:5%,start
In the group dance, Asia's role is little.

00:16:23.615 --> 00:16:27.586 line:5%,start
But I don't think it's demeaning her
as a dancer.

00:16:27.653 --> 00:16:31.857 line:95%,end
People know how my child dances,
so I'm not going to get all feathers

00:16:31.924 --> 00:16:33.792 line:95%,end
ruffled over this flag.
But I remember a flag dance--

00:16:33.859 --> 00:16:36.362 line:95%,end
Do you really think everyone
who goes to dance competitions

00:16:36.462 --> 00:16:37.963 line:95%,end
know your-- how your child dances?

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:39.164 line:95%,end
I think enough people--
HOLLY: Really?

00:16:39.264 --> 00:16:40.833 line:95%,end
--that are important know
how my daughter dances.

00:16:40.899 --> 00:16:41.934 line:95%,end
Yeah.

00:16:42.001 --> 00:16:46.405 line:95%,end
Asia might be a big deal on the internet,
but so was a dog who can bark his ABCs.

00:16:46.472 --> 00:16:50.342 line:95%,end
I never heard of Asia before
she walked through this door.

00:16:50.442 --> 00:16:54.046 line:95%,end
I just think that's a really
big thing to say.

00:16:54.113 --> 00:16:57.149 line:95%,end
The competitions that we do
in other states are larger.

00:16:57.216 --> 00:17:01.387 line:95%,end
I'm just mainly stating a fact that the
women up here did not know who Asia was.

00:17:01.487 --> 00:17:02.688 line:95%,end
There's nothing to disagree about.

00:17:02.755 --> 00:17:04.456 line:95%,end
I didn't even know who Nia was.

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:06.325 line:95%,end
But I wouldn't expect you to.

00:17:06.392 --> 00:17:09.661 line:95%,end
All of the moms have worked really hard to
get our girls where they are in this team.

00:17:09.728 --> 00:17:13.365 line:95%,end
So to have Kristie Ray waltz in
and act like she's a star--

00:17:13.465 --> 00:17:15.501 line:95%,end
it's pretty obnoxious, to say the least.

00:17:15.567 --> 00:17:18.470 line:95%,end
I'm not afraid to say
anything at any time.

00:17:18.537 --> 00:17:20.739 line:95%,end
I don't care what you say
and what you don't say.

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:22.741 line:95%,end
So let's get that clear.

00:17:23.509 --> 00:17:26.578 line:95%,end
Sometimes we have nothing interesting
or intelligent to say.

00:17:26.645 --> 00:17:27.579 line:95%,end
You should just be quiet.

00:17:27.646 --> 00:17:29.081 line:95%,end
And I won't be quiet because I always

00:17:29.181 --> 00:17:30.816 line:95%,end
do have something interesting
and intelligent to say.

00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:33.752 line:95%,end
I disagree on that one.
We can agree to disagree on that.

[music playing]

00:17:41.894 --> 00:17:47.032 line:5%,start
ABBY: Eight, seven,
six, five, four, three--

00:17:47.099 --> 00:17:48.934 line:5%,start
I only have two days
with this number on stage.

00:17:49.001 --> 00:17:53.138 line:5%,start
I need to make sure everything is perfect,
including the costumes.

00:17:53.639 --> 00:17:58.510 line:95%,end
My vision is patriotic--
an assortment of red, white, and blue.

00:17:58.577 --> 00:18:00.679 line:95%,end
So I figured the moms to do it.

00:18:01.013 --> 00:18:02.548 line:95%,end
There is no costumes.

00:18:02.614 --> 00:18:03.649 line:95%,end
[chuckles]

00:18:03.715 --> 00:18:07.553 line:95%,end
Did anyone go home and do any
of the costume with the flag

00:18:07.619 --> 00:18:08.854 line:95%,end
or do anything with the flag?

00:18:08.921 --> 00:18:10.622 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: No. I did not.

00:18:10.689 --> 00:18:13.325 line:5%,start
Abby wants us to make a costume
this week out of a flag.

00:18:13.392 --> 00:18:16.962 line:5%,start
But I thought it was against
the rules to cut a flag.

00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:19.465 line:95%,end
I think that that's, like, unpatriotic.

00:18:19.565 --> 00:18:23.869 line:95%,end
My God, like, people die for that freedom
that that flag represents.

00:18:23.936 --> 00:18:25.037 line:95%,end
Absolutely.

00:18:25.104 --> 00:18:27.873 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: And for us to be like,
"Cover your booty with it"--

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.876 line:5%,start
There are some things you just do not do.

00:18:30.943 --> 00:18:36.014 line:95%,end
And tampering-- destroying the
American flag is one of them.

00:18:36.081 --> 00:18:37.649 line:95%,end
You should not use it as a costume.

00:18:37.749 --> 00:18:39.051 line:95%,end
[laughs]

00:18:40.285 --> 00:18:42.955 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:18:45.324 --> 00:18:48.227 line:95%,end
ABBY: In the history
of the Abby Lee Dance Company,

00:18:48.293 --> 00:18:52.131 line:95%,end
there has always been more
than one top dancer.

00:18:52.197 --> 00:18:54.299 line:95%,end
And now there's Maddie and Chloe.

00:18:54.399 --> 00:18:58.303 line:95%,end
And they're amazing because they
have each other to compete with.

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:00.806 line:95%,end
That's where you let that arm
get caught up over your head.

00:19:03.175 --> 00:19:06.812 line:95%,end
If their leg is this high,
you want yours to be higher.

00:19:07.379 --> 00:19:10.482 line:95%,end
If they could jump as high,
you want to jump higher.

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:17.256 line:95%,end
Every child gets better because the girl
standing next to her is getting better.

00:19:21.293 --> 00:19:24.429 line:95%,end
Chloe and Maddie going
head-to-head this week is huge.

00:19:24.496 --> 00:19:28.500 line:95%,end
Their rivalry has been going on for years,
where they back and forth in first place.

00:19:28.567 --> 00:19:31.937 line:95%,end
Chloe is just as talented as Maddie,
but she's out of practice.

00:19:32.004 --> 00:19:34.339 line:95%,end
And I'm happy that Chloe
finally is going to get a chance

00:19:34.406 --> 00:19:36.842 line:95%,end
to show that she's
the reigning National Champ.

00:19:37.676 --> 00:19:39.378 line:95%,end
I think that's it.
Maddie, why don't you get a drink?

00:19:39.444 --> 00:19:42.147 line:95%,end
Chloe, grab a drink.
Asia, go right now.

00:19:42.214 --> 00:19:44.883 line:95%,end
[drum beating]

00:19:47.553 --> 00:19:49.788 line:95%,end
Asia is quite impressive.

00:19:49.855 --> 00:19:52.291 line:95%,end
She has so much electricity
when she dances.

00:19:52.357 --> 00:19:54.760 line:95%,end
I think Mackenzie should sit
and watch Asia.

00:19:54.826 --> 00:19:59.264 line:95%,end
Hey, she's sitting on her but getting
worse and Asia's on stage getting better.

00:19:59.331 --> 00:20:00.566 line:95%,end
Very good!

00:20:00.666 --> 00:20:03.402 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:20:07.406 --> 00:20:09.608 line:95%,end
Melissa's made it very clear
to all the moms

00:20:09.675 --> 00:20:12.678 line:95%,end
she's not the least bit threatened
by Asia or Kristie.

00:20:12.744 --> 00:20:15.214 line:95%,end
I'm going to go ask
Abby about the costumes.

00:20:16.815 --> 00:20:20.586 line:95%,end
But if I was Melissa,
I would feel a little threatened.

00:20:20.652 --> 00:20:23.355 line:95%,end
So what's happening with the foot?
What do you think?

00:20:24.056 --> 00:20:25.224 line:95%,end
She really wants to dance.

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:27.726 line:95%,end
I mean, Asia comes in from out of town,
boom.

00:20:27.793 --> 00:20:30.395 line:95%,end
She comes in right when
Mackenzie's injured.

00:20:30.462 --> 00:20:32.898 line:95%,end
Asia and Mackenzie both
have great qualities,


00:20:32.965 --> 00:20:35.234 line:95%,end
and they also both have a lot of flaws.

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:38.503 line:95%,end
But if Mackenzie keeps sitting
and Asia keeps dancing,

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:40.072 line:95%,end
Asia's going to get better.

00:20:40.138 --> 00:20:44.977 line:95%,end
You know, she doesn't want to let
Asia waltz into here from 3,000 miles away

00:20:45.043 --> 00:20:46.878 line:95%,end
and pass her up and take her spot.

00:20:49.214 --> 00:20:51.550 line:5%,start
[music playing]

00:20:52.017 --> 00:20:53.252 line:95%,end
Ready? Let's go.

00:20:53.318 --> 00:20:55.621 line:95%,end
Paige, give her the flag back
so she can do it.

00:20:55.721 --> 00:20:57.923 line:95%,end
When you put it over her,
it needs to be vertical.

00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:00.726 line:95%,end
Because Paige can't adapt
quickly to that change.

00:21:00.792 --> 00:21:04.563 line:95%,end
She wouldn't know how to just
twist it around 90 degrees.

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:07.299 line:95%,end
Asia and Paige both
have to work with the flag.

00:21:07.399 --> 00:21:09.368 line:95%,end
I mean, Asia runs around with it,

00:21:09.434 --> 00:21:11.436 line:95%,end
and Paige has to hold
it up the correct way.

00:21:11.503 --> 00:21:14.573 line:95%,end
So they both have to work
together to make this work.

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.441 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:21:16.508 --> 00:21:20.279 line:95%,end
(SINGING) Seeds of anger--

00:21:20.379 --> 00:21:25.784 line:95%,end
The group routine "Free the People"
is very inspirational, patriotic.

00:21:25.851 --> 00:21:28.387 line:95%,end
And you just want to stand up
when that flag comes out.

00:21:30.889 --> 00:21:34.459 line:95%,end
(SINGING) We all want the same thing.

00:21:35.027 --> 00:21:36.461 line:95%,end

00:21:36.561 --> 00:21:38.096 line:95%,end
Chase her! Keep running!

00:21:40.499 --> 00:21:43.435 line:95%,end
Kendall, you're chasing her!

00:21:44.102 --> 00:21:46.405 line:95%,end
What? What? What did she do?

00:21:46.471 --> 00:21:48.674 line:95%,end
ABBY: Kendall, when you chase someone,

00:21:48.774 --> 00:21:51.443 line:95%,end
should you be in front of them
or behind them?

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:53.278 line:95%,end
When Kendall and Chloe and Maddie

00:21:53.345 --> 00:21:55.480 line:95%,end
all ran to the middle
and they all got balled up,

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:57.516 line:95%,end
but she yelled at Kendall.

00:21:57.616 --> 00:22:00.986 line:95%,end
ABBY: OK. Kendall, meet Asia.

00:22:01.053 --> 00:22:04.022 line:95%,end
You're going to chase
her around this room.

00:22:04.389 --> 00:22:06.558 line:95%,end
When you get up, you go behind her.

00:22:06.625 --> 00:22:09.328 line:95%,end
You fall in line behind her.

00:22:09.428 --> 00:22:13.098 line:95%,end
KENDALL: I know, but she was still
doing her grand jetÃ© when we rolled up.

00:22:13.165 --> 00:22:15.467 line:95%,end
ABBY: I expect you to go into
another room or the den

00:22:15.534 --> 00:22:17.202 line:95%,end
and start working on that number.

00:22:17.269 --> 00:22:19.304 line:95%,end
Every step of it, go.

00:22:19.371 --> 00:22:22.507 line:95%,end
I work my butt off
to make sure Abby has no reason

00:22:22.574 --> 00:22:24.476 line:95%,end
to yell at me or my daughter.

00:22:24.543 --> 00:22:25.844 line:95%,end
But she does anyway.

00:22:25.944 --> 00:22:26.745 line:95%,end
All right.

00:22:26.812 --> 00:22:28.046 line:95%,end
I just wanted to check on you.

00:22:28.113 --> 00:22:30.048 line:95%,end
Abby says dance is political.

00:22:30.115 --> 00:22:33.552 line:95%,end
Well, I'm the one that walked
her dog and bought her gifts.

00:22:33.618 --> 00:22:37.622 line:95%,end

Excuse me.

00:22:43.261 --> 00:22:46.231 line:95%,end
We have something that we need to discuss.

00:22:46.298 --> 00:22:48.467 line:95%,end
ABBY: I don't have anything to discuss.
- Well, I-- listen. I'm need to find out--

00:22:48.533 --> 00:22:50.068 line:95%,end
But why is your kid crying?
Every-- everbody else--

00:22:50.135 --> 00:22:51.269 line:95%,end
- Because you don't scream at--
- Everybody else gets yelled at.

00:22:51.336 --> 00:22:53.805 line:95%,end
- She's a baby.
- --any other kid like you scream at her.

00:22:53.872 --> 00:22:56.508 line:95%,end
Oh-- you say one thing to that kid
and, "Boo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo,

"she's crying to her mother."

00:22:58.643 --> 00:22:59.678 line:95%,end
You know what, Kendall?

00:22:59.745 --> 00:23:02.447 line:95%,end
If you want to be the baby of the team,
that's fine.

00:23:02.514 --> 00:23:04.149 line:95%,end
Go. There's the door, right there.

JILL: Abby, I wish it were that easy.

00:23:05.884 --> 00:23:06.718 line:95%,end
ABBY: I understand that, but--

00:23:06.785 --> 00:23:08.186 line:95%,end
And if that's really what you want,
then we will.

00:23:08.253 --> 00:23:09.321 line:95%,end
That's-- that's not what I want.

00:23:09.388 --> 00:23:10.689 line:95%,end
JILL: I didn't think
that's what you wanted.

00:23:10.756 --> 00:23:11.656 line:95%,end
ABBY: But I don't get what
the crying, boo-hoo little--

00:23:11.723 --> 00:23:12.591 line:95%,end
I don't either.

The other moms can't--

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.395 line:95%,end
Your kid is a brat--

00:23:18.163 --> 00:23:20.232 line:95%,end
Are you kidding me?
ABBY: Is crying, she's crying one--

00:23:20.298 --> 00:23:22.501 line:95%,end
There are brats in there,
and Kendall is not one of them,

00:23:22.567 --> 00:23:23.802 line:95%,end

The competition is tough.

00:23:36.481 --> 00:23:39.184 line:5%,start
They're going to have to battle
their way to the top.

Ooh, this is neat!

00:23:41.586 --> 00:23:43.755 line:95%,end
This is like Dungeons and Dragons.

00:23:43.822 --> 00:23:47.559 line:5%,start
Jill's right. We're all in the dungeon,

JILL: Asia was crying
in the dressing room the other night.

00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:00.138 line:95%,end
Not because I yelled at her.

00:24:00.205 --> 00:24:02.474 line:95%,end
Yeah, because you never yell at her.
[laughs]

00:24:02.541 --> 00:24:05.143 line:95%,end
I know that Asia was
crying in the dressing room.

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:08.280 line:5%,start
I mean, it's-- it's
really not my business,

00:24:08.346 --> 00:24:10.382 line:95%,end
but I wanted Abby to know.

00:24:10.449 --> 00:24:13.618 line:95%,end

were tattletaling on a 7-year-old.

00:24:13.685 --> 00:24:16.621 line:95%,end
Oh, I didn't tattletale.
I wanted her mom to explain.

ABBY: I can't believe Jill, a grown woman,

00:24:19.791 --> 00:24:22.594 line:95%,end
is tattletaling on a 7-year-old.

00:24:22.661 --> 00:24:25.363 line:95%,end
Jill, we all know who
the crybaby on the team is.

Yeah, well, you--

you keep reminding everybody.

I feel much better with the moms

00:24:43.315 --> 00:24:46.184 line:95%,end
making the costumes
out of handkerchiefs and fabric

00:24:46.251 --> 00:24:47.853 line:95%,end
rather than cutting up a flag.

00:24:47.953 --> 00:24:50.422 line:95%,end
I just feel like that
was totally against the rules.

I'm worried about her making sure

that flag is used correctly.

00:25:05.704 --> 00:25:09.541 line:95%,end
But I'm also a little concerned with Asia
stretching that flag over Paige.

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:13.111 line:95%,end
No. No. No.

00:25:13.979 --> 00:25:15.780 line:95%,end
OK. You're not getting low enough

00:25:15.847 --> 00:25:18.316 line:95%,end
and you're not grabbing it in front,
like, here.

00:25:18.383 --> 00:25:19.551 line:95%,end
Right hand on blue.

00:25:19.618 --> 00:25:20.685 line:95%,end
Do it again.

00:25:20.752 --> 00:25:23.889 line:95%,end
No. No. No. No. No. No. Flip it over.

00:25:23.955 --> 00:25:29.628 line:95%,end
These girls better do the group dance
perfect or we're screwed.

00:25:29.694 --> 00:25:31.630 line:95%,end
Line up, soldiers!

KELLY: If Abby thought that
the main part of the dance

00:25:34.366 --> 00:25:36.501 line:95%,end
was Paige holding the flag up correctly,

00:25:36.568 --> 00:25:39.337 line:95%,end
then she should've rehearsed
it a lot more than 30 seconds

00:25:39.404 --> 00:25:40.572 line:95%,end
before they went on stage.

00:25:40.639 --> 00:25:44.376 line:95%,end
Remember, this routine loses,
they're blaming you.

KRISTIE: Anything could go wrong.

00:25:45.911 --> 00:25:49.014 line:5%,start
But as far as Asia handling the flag,

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:50.315 line:5%,start
I think she can pull it off.

number 74, "Free the People."

So we know that Paige
held the flag up wrong.

00:27:29.514 --> 00:27:32.917 line:95%,end
But knowing that Asia is
the new kid on the team,

00:27:32.984 --> 00:27:36.855 line:95%,end
I'm hoping that the mothers don't target
her to blame for this flag.

00:27:42.527 --> 00:27:45.864 line:95%,end
Asia puts the flag on
Paige's back, upside down.

00:27:45.964 --> 00:27:47.265 line:95%,end

Come on. Let's go.
Let's go. Let's go.

00:27:54.105 --> 00:27:56.675 line:95%,end
I told Paige, who is 12 years old,

00:27:57.709 --> 00:27:59.878 line:95%,end
10 times how to hold the flag.

00:27:59.944 --> 00:28:03.448 line:95%,end
Were you taught what to
do in class, in rehearsal?

00:28:03.515 --> 00:28:04.983 line:95%,end
Did we go over it?

00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:06.117 line:95%,end
And the one most.

00:28:06.184 --> 00:28:10.321 line:95%,end
Important thing was right hand
on the blue section.

00:28:10.388 --> 00:28:12.724 line:95%,end
Well, but, she hung it that way

00:28:12.791 --> 00:28:16.161 line:95%,end
because if you looked at her
when she was pulling it out,

00:28:16.227 --> 00:28:17.796 line:95%,end
she was holding it by the stripes.

00:28:17.862 --> 00:28:19.564 line:95%,end
So she just held it the other way.

00:28:19.631 --> 00:28:21.666 line:95%,end
She learned what to do.

00:28:21.733 --> 00:28:22.934 line:95%,end
And she knew that she needed to get

00:28:23.001 --> 00:28:27.038 line:95%,end
those blue stars in her
right hand to pull it up.

00:28:28.673 --> 00:28:31.843 line:95%,end
This week we're performing
a political number.

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:33.578 line:95%,end
And getting to vote is a big deal,

00:28:33.645 --> 00:28:36.848 line:95%,end
so I thought why not have
the kids judge each other?

00:28:36.915 --> 00:28:39.651 line:95%,end
All right, girls, we're going
to do something a little different.

Today everybody who will be sitting
in the audience,

00:28:42.887 --> 00:28:47.325 line:95%,end
you will be voting on Maddie or Chloe.

00:28:49.894 --> 00:28:52.297 line:95%,end
Here's another one of Abby's
twisted lessons--

00:28:52.363 --> 00:28:54.232 line:95%,end
the politics of dance.

00:28:54.299 --> 00:28:56.568 line:95%,end
I get that you have to vote and everybody

00:28:56.634 --> 00:28:59.537 line:95%,end
gets a vote and someone
wins and someone loses.

00:28:59.604 --> 00:29:02.640 line:95%,end
But it doesn't make it any easier
to vote against your friends.

00:29:02.707 --> 00:29:05.043 line:95%,end
ABBY: So you get to judge
on the performance.

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:07.479 line:95%,end
It's up to you to go in there
and make a choice.

You're going to have

silent vote for who danced better,
Chloe or Maddie?

00:29:25.163 --> 00:29:27.732 line:95%,end
What are you hoping to gain out of that?

00:29:27.799 --> 00:29:30.301 line:95%,end
I want you to see that when you're

00:29:30.401 --> 00:29:32.971 line:5%,start
judging many different
things come into play.

I am trying to get these
kids motivated to be more

00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:42.947 line:95%,end
What better way than sitting
in the audience and judging?

Come on, come on, let's go.

00:29:45.216 --> 00:29:47.552 line:95%,end
I think healthy competition between them

looked good on stage.

But it's hard to watch
because I feel bad for Mackenzie.

00:31:37.295 --> 00:31:38.796 line:5%,start
It's breaking her heart.

Good job!

00:31:41.165 --> 00:31:42.433 line:95%,end

I wonder why Abby's doing that voting
thing for Maddie and I.

00:31:52.543 --> 00:31:56.381 line:95%,end
Maybe because you guys haven't competed
against each other in a while.

00:31:56.447 --> 00:31:59.817 line:95%,end
They want to see
who's been working harder.

The dance competition world

Kids don't always understand.

I want to see if this vote helps them
to see what the judges are seeing.

Just because somebody is your friend

00:32:09.527 --> 00:32:14.132 line:95%,end
doesn't mean that they're going
to show favoritism towards you.

I thought she was beautiful

HOLLY: Although awkward,
I think the voting experience

00:40:17.114 --> 00:40:18.482 line:95%,end
was a good one for the girls.

00:40:18.549 --> 00:40:20.985 line:95%,end
Because this is not about
friendship or popularity.

00:40:21.051 --> 00:40:24.321 line:95%,end
It's about who can get
the job done for the team.

00:40:24.388 --> 00:40:27.458 line:95%,end
Now, Abby, next time two of your kids
go head-to-head in a category,

00:40:27.525 --> 00:40:28.392 line:95%,end
you going to have everybody vote?

00:40:28.459 --> 00:40:29.760 line:95%,end
Because you've never done this before

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:32.730 line:95%,end
and it's just clearly a way to make
Chloe feel bad about herself.

00:40:32.797 --> 00:40:38.169 line:95%,end
It's a competitive world, whether it be
politics or dance or school.

00:40:38.235 --> 00:40:41.205 line:95%,end
But you have a lot of other
kids who go and do stuff

00:40:41.272 --> 00:40:42.640 line:95%,end
but you don't call them out on it!

00:40:42.706 --> 00:40:44.175 line:95%,end
You only pick on mine

00:40:44.241 --> 00:40:45.342 line:95%,end
Oh, you're welcome.

00:40:47.511 --> 00:40:50.047 line:95%,end
ABBY (VOICEOVER): Next on "Dance Moms"--

00:40:50.114 --> 00:40:53.417 line:5%,start
I have been officially
invited to be on "The View."

00:40:53.484 --> 00:40:55.152 line:5%,start
[cheering and applause]

00:40:55.786 --> 00:40:58.055 line:5%,start
What if you get hurt again
and you're not good for New York City?

00:40:58.122 --> 00:41:00.524 line:5%,start
Like, right now,
Asia's rehearsing your spot.

00:41:00.591 --> 00:41:02.326 line:5%,start
KRISTIE: It's about this whole charade.

00:41:02.393 --> 00:41:03.561 line:5%,start
Don't let her rehearse.
- What charade?

00:41:03.627 --> 00:41:04.562 line:5%,start
KRISTIE: The charade about the foot.

00:41:04.628 --> 00:41:05.963 line:5%,start
What the [bleep] is wrong with the foot?

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:08.365 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: I want to know where
the miracle came from because--

00:41:08.432 --> 00:41:09.967 line:5%,start
Why don't you call the
[bleep] doctor and ask him?

00:41:10.034 --> 00:41:12.603 line:5%,start
Don't take it out on me that Abby
pulled your kid from a dance.

00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:16.373 line:5%,start
ABBY: Maddie, if they don't do well,
I'm going to need a new assistant.
