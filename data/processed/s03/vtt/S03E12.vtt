It's speed dating!

I need somebody to rub my feet.

Hey! Guess you didn't expect
to see me out here, huh?

Anything to move Kendall off that spot.

00:00:22.288 --> 00:00:23.823 line:5%,start
I don't feel like we're being a team.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.859 line:5%,start
I think you two have a big hole
to dig yourselves out of.

JILL: I didn't do anything
behind your back.

I did it right in front of you.
And I did it to benefit my child.

What do you mean, the hospital?

Did you witness Mackenzie
doing cartwheels in here?

Don't you lie to me!

Such is life.

KELLY (VOICEOVER): Normally
when the kids get second place,

00:01:52.846 --> 00:01:55.682 line:5%,start
she's screaming at them
that they're the first to lose.

00:01:55.748 --> 00:01:57.750 line:95%,end
So there's definitely
something up with her.

00:01:57.817 --> 00:02:00.053 line:95%,end
ABBY: So let's talk about the group dance.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.989 line:95%,end
You looked exquisite.

If you want to win, we might
have to go back to the basics.

I'm not going to yell at you
or scream at you or anything else.

I'll just smile and be sweet and nice,

whole Abby's being so sweet thing.

Next on the pyramid, Nia.

You weren't feeling well.
We can blame that.

00:03:00.713 --> 00:03:01.781 line:95%,end
You know how to perform.

00:03:02.715 --> 00:03:03.950 line:95%,end
But the legs get sloppy,

the feet get sloppy, the arms get sloppy.

Next I have Paige.

Next, Maddie.

You did four turns in the corner.
Stunning.

00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:51.864 line:5%,start
Only one spot away from the top,

00:03:51.931 --> 00:03:54.167 line:5%,start
and I'm not going to stop
until she gets there.

She wants you right on Maddie's heels,
chomping at the bit.

I think that's a good thing.

That seems a little cutthroat,
but to each his own.

I don't know what it is.

to get Kendall ahead on a pyramid.

of the group number this week

could be discharged from the military
just for being gay.

But this is my take on it.

I don't want any secrets or lies.

out in the hallway paid off.

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:53.439 line:95%,end
They need to be sweating,

00:07:53.506 --> 00:07:56.409 line:95%,end
bleeding, crying.


00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:58.544 line:95%,end
They have to want it bad.

00:07:58.611 --> 00:08:02.181 line:95%,end
I chose this routine
because every single one of you

00:08:02.248 --> 00:08:03.649 line:95%,end
has to get back to the basics.

00:08:03.716 --> 00:08:07.286 line:95%,end
Where is the technique?
Where is the love of dance?

00:08:07.353 --> 00:08:09.522 line:95%,end
Where is the passion for performing?

00:08:13.226 --> 00:08:15.928 line:95%,end
So I went to the gym today,
and I stayed home all day.

00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:17.763 line:95%,end
And I was online all day,
looking for a place

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:19.131 line:95%,end
for Greg and I to go on a honeymoon.

00:08:19.198 --> 00:08:20.199 line:95%,end
Wait, what?

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.469 line:95%,end
- Again.
- Just a little one, you know.

00:08:23.536 --> 00:08:25.338 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: You're wearing a wedding band!
Are you married?

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:27.740 line:95%,end
CHRISTI (VOICEOVER):
Melissa's wearing a wedding ring.

00:08:27.807 --> 00:08:30.142 line:95%,end
But last time I checked,
she's not married.

00:08:30.209 --> 00:08:31.911 line:95%,end
You're not even supposed to have
your wedding band until then.

00:08:31.978 --> 00:08:34.247 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Wait a minute.
Are you going to get married soon?

00:08:34.313 --> 00:08:36.482 line:95%,end
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:38.284 line:95%,end
- Are we invited?
- CHRISTI: No.

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:40.786 line:95%,end
- She already told us, remember?
- No, it's just going to be us.

00:08:40.853 --> 00:08:41.854 line:95%,end
It's just going to be a
really little wedding.

00:08:41.921 --> 00:08:42.922 line:95%,end
You're not going to take your kids?

00:08:42.989 --> 00:08:44.757 line:95%,end
- Well, they're not many people.
- Just us. Just us.

00:08:44.824 --> 00:08:46.592 line:95%,end
Can you not put Abby on the guest list?

00:08:46.659 --> 00:08:47.660 line:95%,end
[laughter]

00:08:47.727 --> 00:08:49.362 line:95%,end
Can you imagine Abby at Melissa's wedding?

00:08:49.428 --> 00:08:53.399 line:95%,end
I mean, really. I feel sorry for anyone
who has to wrestle her for that bouquet.

00:08:53.466 --> 00:08:54.467 line:95%,end
HOLLY: How can we help?

00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:56.702 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Last time we tried to
do something, like a stripper,

00:08:56.769 --> 00:08:58.237 line:95%,end
you weren't really all that interested.

00:08:58.304 --> 00:08:59.539 line:95%,end
He had love handles.

00:09:00.139 --> 00:09:01.374 line:95%,end
Can we take you dress shopping?

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.142 line:95%,end
- That'd be so fun!
- I think it'll be fun!

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:04.777 line:95%,end
The last time we took you dress shopping,

00:09:04.844 --> 00:09:07.246 line:95%,end
Holly and I were the ones
that tried on the wedding dresses.

00:09:07.313 --> 00:09:09.348 line:95%,end
And I'm not trying anything on this time.

00:09:09.415 --> 00:09:10.483 line:95%,end
[laughter]

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:15.655 line:95%,end
Girls, the name of this routine
is "Don't Ask, Just Tell."

00:09:15.721 --> 00:09:18.758 line:95%,end
This is 2013. Be proud of yourself.

00:09:18.824 --> 00:09:20.593 line:95%,end
You want to win the war, don't you?

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:22.061 line:95%,end
Let's get ready.

00:09:23.963 --> 00:09:26.332 line:5%,start
ABBY (VOICEOVER): We all know
about the military reference,

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:27.967 line:95%,end
Don't Ask, Don't Tell.

00:09:28.034 --> 00:09:32.071 line:95%,end
But my take on that,
I want everybody to tell.

00:09:32.138 --> 00:09:34.473 line:95%,end
I want kids to be proud of who they are.

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:38.544 line:95%,end
I want everybody in this world to speak up
and take a stand for themselves.

00:09:38.611 --> 00:09:43.149 line:95%,end
So we're entitling this routine
"Don't Ask, Just Tell."

00:09:43.215 --> 00:09:46.352 line:95%,end
HOLLY: What story does that dance
tell you right there?

00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:49.689 line:95%,end
I think that Abby is showing her support
to the gay community.

00:09:49.755 --> 00:09:51.958 line:95%,end
Gay? I never got that out of this.

00:09:52.024 --> 00:09:53.793 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Isn't it like
Don't Ask, Don't Tell?

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:55.661 line:95%,end
ABBY: What did you do?

00:09:56.929 --> 00:09:58.064 line:95%,end
I-- get on the floor.

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:00.066 line:95%,end
Give her the floor part
so she can get up with you.

00:10:03.869 --> 00:10:05.638 line:95%,end
No, I took the Side Aerial out.

00:10:05.705 --> 00:10:08.040 line:95%,end
Do the cartwheel, stiff back, handspring.
No chainÃ©.

00:10:08.774 --> 00:10:12.144 line:95%,end
1, 2. Step together, stand up.

00:10:12.211 --> 00:10:13.446 line:95%,end
Yes?

00:10:13.512 --> 00:10:15.781 line:5%,start
The hip hop number
this week is really hard.

00:10:15.848 --> 00:10:17.850 line:5%,start
Mackenzie's struggling a little bit,

00:10:17.917 --> 00:10:20.186 line:95%,end
but she looks adorable in it.

00:10:20.252 --> 00:10:22.288 line:95%,end
Why did you do the leg thing
that you can't do?

00:10:22.355 --> 00:10:25.324 line:95%,end
I changed it because you couldn't do it.

00:10:25.391 --> 00:10:28.094 line:95%,end
You better shape up or ship out.

00:10:30.329 --> 00:10:33.966 line:95%,end
You know, I still took great offense
to Abby praising Jill.

00:10:34.033 --> 00:10:35.167 line:95%,end
I don't think that was right.

00:10:35.234 --> 00:10:38.604 line:95%,end
Nia and Kendall were both
in the duet together,

00:10:38.671 --> 00:10:43.576 line:95%,end
yet one gets to move up the pyramid
and one stays way at the bottom.

00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:45.611 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: But she even said. She said
sometimes your mother can hurt you,

00:10:45.678 --> 00:10:47.113 line:95%,end
but in this case, your mother helped you.

00:10:47.179 --> 00:10:49.515 line:95%,end
KELLY: Yeah, that's exactly
what she taught in there today.

00:10:49.582 --> 00:10:50.983 line:95%,end
That's what she said.

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:53.686 line:95%,end
You moved up the pyramid
because you snuck behind

00:10:53.753 --> 00:10:56.422 line:95%,end
your friend's back
and got a private to better yourself.

00:10:56.489 --> 00:10:58.557 line:95%,end
- I'm not a sneak.
- HOLLY: I don't know.

00:10:58.624 --> 00:11:00.092 line:95%,end
I thought last week was sneaky.

00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:02.461 line:95%,end
Jill approaches life as a competition.

00:11:02.528 --> 00:11:07.133 line:95%,end
So I think if there's any opportunity
for a child to move forward or advance,

00:11:07.199 --> 00:11:09.802 line:95%,end
Jill's always strategizing
for Kendall to move ahead.

00:11:09.869 --> 00:11:12.772 line:95%,end
Holly, if you feel Nia needed help
with something,

00:11:12.838 --> 00:11:15.441 line:95%,end
who am I to stop you
from getting that help?

00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:17.276 line:95%,end
Who am I to say you're sneaky?

00:11:17.343 --> 00:11:18.844 line:95%,end
Did you invite Nia to be part
of a private for the duet?

00:11:18.911 --> 00:11:22.248 line:95%,end
No, but what's funny, it wasn't a private.
I didn't invite Gia.

00:11:22.314 --> 00:11:23.849 line:95%,end
HOLLY: This was about a duet,

00:11:23.916 --> 00:11:26.719 line:95%,end
not having one child
outshine another in a duet.

00:11:26.786 --> 00:11:27.787 line:95%,end
It's not a solo.

00:11:27.853 --> 00:11:29.422 line:95%,end
I can't believe
you're still stuck on this.

00:11:29.488 --> 00:11:32.124 line:95%,end
- I am, because it's a fund--
- JILL: Get over it. It's done. It's over.

00:11:32.191 --> 00:11:33.793 line:95%,end
No, I'm entitled to have my opinion.

00:11:33.859 --> 00:11:35.027 line:95%,end
JILL: And I'm entitled to my--

00:11:35.094 --> 00:11:36.929 line:95%,end
why are you entitled, Holly, and not me?

00:11:36.996 --> 00:11:39.331 line:95%,end
You're entitled to your wrong opinion.
That's fine.

00:11:39.398 --> 00:11:40.399 line:95%,end
KELLY: Bam.

00:11:41.734 --> 00:11:43.035 line:95%,end
JILL (VOICEOVER): I have nothing to hide.

00:11:43.102 --> 00:11:45.604 line:5%,start
And all those moms know
I'll do whatever it takes

00:11:45.671 --> 00:11:47.807 line:5%,start
to get Kendall to the top of the pyramid.

00:11:47.873 --> 00:11:50.509 line:95%,end
Okay. It's not a secret.
And it's not a lie.

00:11:50.576 --> 00:11:51.577 line:95%,end
Deal with it.


00:11:59.752 --> 00:12:02.121 line:95%,end
Do we have any dates yet for our concert?

00:12:02.188 --> 00:12:04.423 line:95%,end
Um, yeah. We have some details.

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:07.727 line:95%,end
We're trying to iron out the floor,
because I'm in a different place.

00:12:07.793 --> 00:12:09.495 line:95%,end
So it's like I have to bring the--

00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:11.664 line:95%,end
Uh, yeah. Hold on one second.
She's right here.

00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:13.432 line:95%,end
- Abby?
- Who is it?

00:12:13.499 --> 00:12:15.468 line:95%,end
- Some guy.
- ABBY: Hello?

00:12:15.534 --> 00:12:17.970 line:95%,end
Oh, hi. How are you?

00:12:20.372 --> 00:12:21.640 line:95%,end
MELISSA (VOICEOVER):
Abby gets a phone call,

00:12:21.707 --> 00:12:24.510 line:95%,end
and she starts being really giddy.

00:12:24.577 --> 00:12:28.080 line:5%,start
And I don't know who's on the other line,
but I know it's a guy.

00:12:28.147 --> 00:12:30.082 line:95%,end
I know! How are you?

00:12:30.149 --> 00:12:31.150 line:95%,end
She's giggly!

00:12:31.217 --> 00:12:32.651 line:95%,end
And did you see how she acted
when it's a guy?

00:12:32.718 --> 00:12:33.719 line:95%,end
I know.

00:12:33.786 --> 00:12:35.554 line:95%,end
[laughs]

00:12:35.621 --> 00:12:37.189 line:95%,end
What is she doing on the phone?

00:12:37.256 --> 00:12:39.592 line:95%,end
She always yells at us
for even looking at our phones,

00:12:39.658 --> 00:12:41.260 line:95%,end
and she's down there,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:12:41.327 --> 00:12:42.628 line:95%,end
I'm glad you didn't lose my number.

00:12:42.695 --> 00:12:43.896 line:95%,end
Whoever she's talking to, she looks happy.

00:12:43.963 --> 00:12:44.997 line:95%,end
I think she's an open studio.
CHRISTI: Look at her.

00:12:45.064 --> 00:12:46.999 line:95%,end
Maybe she called Jill's 900 number.

00:12:47.066 --> 00:12:48.434 line:95%,end
Stop with it.

00:12:48.501 --> 00:12:51.103 line:95%,end
If you notice,
I haven't had that in a while.

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:52.872 line:95%,end
[laughs]

00:12:52.938 --> 00:12:55.708 line:95%,end
No one is rehearsing.
Not a solo is being rehearsed.

00:12:55.775 --> 00:12:58.911 line:95%,end
Not a group dance is being rehearsed.
This is like a total waste of time.

00:12:58.978 --> 00:13:02.314 line:95%,end
These kids could be doing something.
The girls should be running their solos.

00:13:02.381 --> 00:13:05.651 line:95%,end
So you're supposed to leave tomorrow,
but you're staying

00:13:05.718 --> 00:13:07.853 line:95%,end
so we can go out? Well, that's nice.

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:10.956 line:95%,end
- We want to know who she's talking to.
- I just want to tell you what happened.

00:13:11.023 --> 00:13:13.192 line:95%,end
Her phone rings. Gia answers it.

00:13:13.859 --> 00:13:16.295 line:95%,end
- And it's some man.
- ABBY: [laughs]

00:13:16.362 --> 00:13:17.897 line:95%,end
JILL (VOICEOVER):
I'm kind of excited for Abby.

00:13:17.963 --> 00:13:19.799 line:95%,end
A guy would be great for her.

00:13:19.865 --> 00:13:23.736 line:5%,start
Whatever keeps Abby happy
is good for all of us.

00:13:23.803 --> 00:13:24.804 line:95%,end
HOLLY: She's still talking.

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:26.872 line:95%,end
She walked-- she got up
and left me in the dust.

00:13:26.939 --> 00:13:29.074 line:95%,end
It's probably because it's the first boy
who's ever called her.

00:13:29.141 --> 00:13:31.177 line:95%,end
I might be a little rusty.
I haven't been out in a while.

00:13:31.243 --> 00:13:34.180 line:95%,end
I need a little hubba, hubba.
That's-- that's definitely right.

00:13:34.246 --> 00:13:36.248 line:95%,end
I hope she goes on a date.
Maybe she'll get laid

00:13:36.315 --> 00:13:38.050 line:95%,end
- so she's not so miserable.
- [laughs]

00:13:38.117 --> 00:13:40.286 line:5%,start
The kids are in the room,
ready for rehearsal.

00:13:40.352 --> 00:13:42.054 line:5%,start
And Abby's out there on the phone.

00:13:42.121 --> 00:13:45.024 line:95%,end
She's always on them
for not being prepared,

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:46.826 line:95%,end
and here they are.
They're ready to rehearse.

00:13:46.892 --> 00:13:47.993 line:95%,end
And she's out there on the phone.

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:50.496 line:95%,end
Get off the phone,
and practice what you preach!

00:13:50.563 --> 00:13:52.498 line:95%,end
[laughs]

00:13:52.565 --> 00:13:56.635 line:95%,end
- Oh, my god.
- [mocking laughter]

00:13:56.702 --> 00:13:58.737 line:95%,end
Oh, god. Make me puke.

00:13:58.804 --> 00:14:00.639 line:95%,end
[laughs]

00:14:00.706 --> 00:14:01.774 line:95%,end
Come on, let's go find out who it is.

00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:03.876 line:95%,end
- I am not going out there, asking her--
- I don't want to know who she was--

00:14:03.943 --> 00:14:06.278 line:95%,end
- You guys go ahead.
- Come on, come on. Come on.

00:14:06.345 --> 00:14:09.081 line:5%,start
I so don't want to know
what's going on with Abby's love life.

00:14:09.148 --> 00:14:11.317 line:5%,start
I mean, talk about don't ask, just tell.

00:14:11.383 --> 00:14:12.651 line:95%,end
I don't want her to tell me anything

00:14:12.718 --> 00:14:15.020 line:95%,end
because the images
that come to mind are horrifying.

00:14:15.087 --> 00:14:16.889 line:95%,end
Okay. Well, thank you for calling.

00:14:16.956 --> 00:14:18.424 line:95%,end
I look forward to seeing you.

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:20.960 line:95%,end
- We're investigating!
- Melissa has a question for you.

00:14:21.026 --> 00:14:23.329 line:95%,end
- ABBY: What?
- We love how giggly you were!

00:14:23.395 --> 00:14:24.997 line:95%,end
Oh.

00:14:25.064 --> 00:14:26.799 line:95%,end
We don't usually see you so happy.

00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:29.001 line:95%,end
Well, you know you took me
on that speed dating thing.

00:14:29.068 --> 00:14:31.070 line:95%,end
- Ah!
- No, no, no, no, no.

00:14:31.136 --> 00:14:33.272 line:95%,end
But when I left there,

00:14:33.339 --> 00:14:37.042 line:95%,end
I went the other way
to get on the parkway to go home.

00:14:37.109 --> 00:14:40.479 line:95%,end
And I stopped at a--
at a gas station.

00:14:40.546 --> 00:14:43.949 line:95%,end
And I met this guy that was standing there
right next to me, pumping gas.

00:14:44.016 --> 00:14:46.485 line:95%,end
- Did he offer to pump your gas?
- Yes, he did.

00:14:46.552 --> 00:14:47.887 line:95%,end
Oh!

00:14:47.953 --> 00:14:50.489 line:95%,end
Well, let's help Abby
prepare for her date.

00:14:50.556 --> 00:14:53.492 line:95%,end
- No, no, no, no.
- [applause]

00:14:53.559 --> 00:14:55.294 line:95%,end
JILL: Holly, you can be
in charge of her clothes.

00:14:55.361 --> 00:14:56.528 line:95%,end
MELISSA: And you can do her makeup.

00:14:56.595 --> 00:14:59.465 line:95%,end
[interposing voices]

00:14:59.531 --> 00:15:02.101 line:95%,end
It's like Moe, Larry, and Curly
are gonna help me?

00:15:02.167 --> 00:15:03.235 line:95%,end
I don't think so.

00:15:03.302 --> 00:15:04.937 line:95%,end
I'm gonna go get my nails done,
and that's it.

00:15:05.004 --> 00:15:06.005 line:95%,end
HOLLY: okay, well, go do your nails.

00:15:06.071 --> 00:15:07.373 line:95%,end
ABBY: I'm not getting them done
because I have a date.

00:15:07.439 --> 00:15:08.908 line:95%,end
I'm getting them done
because they need done.

00:15:08.974 --> 00:15:10.242 line:95%,end
- That's it.
- Okay. That's fine.

00:15:10.309 --> 00:15:11.944 line:95%,end
- We can start with that.
- Alright.

00:15:12.011 --> 00:15:13.178 line:95%,end
- HOLLY: That sounds like fun.
- Toodle-oo!

00:15:13.245 --> 00:15:14.647 line:95%,end
- Toodle-oo.
- There you go.

00:15:14.713 --> 00:15:15.915 line:95%,end
There you go.

00:15:15.981 --> 00:15:17.616 line:95%,end
ABBY (VOICEOVER):
These moms are ridiculous.

00:15:17.683 --> 00:15:20.886 line:5%,start
I don't need, nor do I want their help.

00:15:20.953 --> 00:15:22.588 line:95%,end
I've been on plenty of dates before.

00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:31.030 line:5%,start
ABBY: Come on, Kendall!
Get in here! Let's go!

00:15:31.797 --> 00:15:34.033 line:5%,start
Don't look down at the floor
when you walk around.

00:15:34.099 --> 00:15:36.435 line:5%,start
Kendall's solo is entitled
"Secrets and Lies."

00:15:36.502 --> 00:15:41.273 line:95%,end
Kendall, you need to tell that audience
that you are keeping a big secret.

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:43.876 line:95%,end
ABBY: Legs together!
Your ankles are separated!

00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:47.780 line:95%,end
I'm so excited that Abby is giving
Kendall a solo this week.


00:15:47.846 --> 00:15:50.416 line:95%,end
ABBY: Get a pliÃ© in there!
You're not even turned out!

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:55.220 line:95%,end
The more opportunities this kid has,
the better she is going to be.

00:15:57.356 --> 00:16:00.659 line:95%,end
ABBY: Okay. You're just dead in the face.
You're dead in the face.

00:16:00.726 --> 00:16:02.361 line:95%,end
It's what you make it on the stage.

00:16:02.428 --> 00:16:04.363 line:95%,end
You get out there and you look
like some scared little kid?

00:16:05.798 --> 00:16:07.633 line:95%,end
Not going to have too many more solos.

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:09.702 line:95%,end
I need to see this.

00:16:09.768 --> 00:16:12.471 line:95%,end
If you want to be Maddie,
and your mother wants you to be Maddie,

00:16:12.538 --> 00:16:13.772 line:95%,end
then you need to get the face.

00:16:13.839 --> 00:16:17.743 line:95%,end
JILL (VOICEOVER): Each dancer
has their own unique style.

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:21.981 line:95%,end
And I understand that Abby wants
Kendall to dance like Maddie.

00:16:22.047 --> 00:16:23.649 line:95%,end
I want Kendall to dance like Maddie.

00:16:23.716 --> 00:16:26.752 line:95%,end
However, you don't want
a canned presentation

00:16:26.819 --> 00:16:29.955 line:95%,end
where every single kid
looks exactly the same.

00:16:30.022 --> 00:16:31.490 line:95%,end
Go.

00:16:37.563 --> 00:16:39.398 line:5%,start
Come on, everybody! Let's go!

00:16:40.666 --> 00:16:42.067 line:5%,start
Girls, let's go! Let's go!

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:47.539 line:95%,end
- MACKENZIE: I hurt my--
- You hurt your foot?

00:16:49.508 --> 00:16:50.542 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Where's Mackenz?

00:16:52.111 --> 00:16:53.479 line:95%,end
MELISSA (VOICEOVER):
Group rehearsal is starting again.

00:16:53.545 --> 00:16:57.249 line:95%,end
Mackenzie is not in the rehearsal,
and I have to see what's going on.

00:16:57.316 --> 00:16:59.885 line:95%,end
Mackenz, I'm coming. What's wrong, honey?

00:17:02.755 --> 00:17:04.790 line:95%,end
Okay, but honey-- but don't cry.
Why are you crying?

00:17:06.558 --> 00:17:09.828 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Oh, honey. I know you don't.
But you're not letting Miss Abby down.

00:17:09.895 --> 00:17:13.632 line:95%,end
It'll let her down if you hurt it worse,
and she understands that.

00:17:13.699 --> 00:17:15.567 line:95%,end
So how about we get some ice on it?

00:17:15.634 --> 00:17:17.369 line:95%,end
It's okay. You just need to rest it.

00:17:17.436 --> 00:17:20.139 line:95%,end
Mackenzie actually hurt
her foot two weeks ago.

00:17:20.205 --> 00:17:24.143 line:95%,end
And she's been really limping,
and she's not doing well at all.

00:17:24.209 --> 00:17:25.878 line:95%,end
How's your foot?

00:17:25.944 --> 00:17:27.413 line:95%,end
What happened?

00:17:27.479 --> 00:17:30.849 line:95%,end
I'm so sad for Mackenzie
because I think this dance

00:17:30.916 --> 00:17:33.152 line:95%,end
is probably the best dance
that she's ever done.

00:17:33.218 --> 00:17:36.355 line:95%,end
And she really shines in the dance,
so she's so broken-hearted.

00:17:36.989 --> 00:17:39.124 line:95%,end
- Yes?
- I just want to tell you,

00:17:39.191 --> 00:17:41.460 line:95%,end
this is Mackenzie's
probably most favorite dance.

00:17:41.527 --> 00:17:44.430 line:95%,end
She hurt her foot
doing a Back Tuck on Monday,

00:17:44.496 --> 00:17:45.898 line:95%,end
but it's not even swollen.

00:17:45.964 --> 00:17:48.000 line:95%,end
I don't know what's really wrong
with Mackenzie's foot.

00:17:48.067 --> 00:17:50.002 line:95%,end
I kind of have to see how she's moving.

00:17:50.069 --> 00:17:51.537 line:95%,end
Maybe it's all in her head.

00:17:51.603 --> 00:17:53.939 line:95%,end
Maybe she just doesn't want
to be in the group routine.

00:17:54.006 --> 00:17:57.276 line:95%,end
Maybe she doesn't want to be
the reason they don't win.

00:17:57.342 --> 00:17:59.078 line:95%,end
Do you want to see
what she can do and then--

00:17:59.144 --> 00:18:01.313 line:95%,end
ABBY: So she either needs to do it
or she's out.

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:03.082 line:95%,end
I need to-- I need to work on it
without her.

00:18:03.148 --> 00:18:04.416 line:95%,end
Okay, got it.

00:18:04.483 --> 00:18:07.086 line:95%,end
Miss Abby wants you
to put your boots on, Kenz.

00:18:07.152 --> 00:18:09.221 line:95%,end
Just go in and see what you can do, okay?

00:18:09.288 --> 00:18:11.623 line:95%,end
Just try to do the dance, okay?

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:14.927 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Why is she having Mackenzie
do the dance if she's hurt?

00:18:14.993 --> 00:18:17.029 line:95%,end
ABBY: Face, Mackenzie, face!

00:18:17.096 --> 00:18:19.398 line:95%,end
I think Melissa said,
no, no, she loves the dance.

00:18:19.465 --> 00:18:24.036 line:95%,end
I love point numbers,
and that doesn't mean I can do them.

00:18:24.103 --> 00:18:27.005 line:95%,end
Uh, I don't know what's quite going on.

00:18:27.072 --> 00:18:29.942 line:95%,end
Because a second ago,
Mackenzie was crying that her foot hurt,

00:18:30.008 --> 00:18:32.744 line:95%,end
and now she's rehearsing with the group.
Hmm.

00:18:32.811 --> 00:18:34.680 line:5%,start
Watch your line.
You're in a-- you're not in a window.

00:18:34.746 --> 00:18:36.148 line:5%,start
You're right behind Maddie.

00:18:36.215 --> 00:18:38.317 line:95%,end
Get in the window, Kendall!
Be smarter!

00:18:38.383 --> 00:18:42.387 line:95%,end
So, you guys, we're going
to have a little bridal shower

00:18:42.454 --> 00:18:44.756 line:95%,end
for Melissa and take her dress
shopping because she agreed.

00:18:44.823 --> 00:18:46.091 line:95%,end
Wait a minute.

00:18:46.158 --> 00:18:48.660 line:95%,end
Last time we mentioned a ring,
we got a cease and desist.

00:18:48.727 --> 00:18:51.130 line:95%,end
If we have a bridal shower,
we might get full-on sued.

00:18:51.196 --> 00:18:53.532 line:95%,end
- No, I think it's different now.
- I'm sure.

00:18:53.599 --> 00:18:54.933 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Did all the divorces go through?

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.502 line:95%,end
- [laughs]

00:18:56.568 --> 00:18:58.504 line:95%,end
And I think she wants us
to be a part of it now.

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:00.672 line:95%,end
Before, maybe she didn't.
I don't-- I don't know.

00:19:00.739 --> 00:19:03.609 line:95%,end
That's what we wanted to do last year
with her and she wouldn't let us.

00:19:03.675 --> 00:19:06.145 line:95%,end
She kind of was like, back off.

00:19:06.211 --> 00:19:09.781 line:5%,start
I think Melissa's in a better place
with us now.

00:19:09.848 --> 00:19:13.919 line:95%,end
She's letting some of her guards down
and is actually opening up more.

00:19:13.986 --> 00:19:17.322 line:95%,end
ABBY: Okay, girls. You have one chance.

00:19:17.389 --> 00:19:19.024 line:95%,end
That's the way it works.

00:19:19.091 --> 00:19:20.526 line:95%,end
You all got lucky.

00:19:20.592 --> 00:19:22.427 line:95%,end
Remember that.

00:19:22.494 --> 00:19:24.830 line:95%,end
Do you think you can do the group dance?

00:19:24.897 --> 00:19:26.632 line:95%,end
Because if you can't,
I need to take you out.

00:19:27.766 --> 00:19:30.169 line:95%,end
No fooling around. No walking.

00:19:30.235 --> 00:19:32.938 line:95%,end
No going to the mall walking on cement.

00:19:33.005 --> 00:19:36.408 line:95%,end
If she's okay to dance, she'll dance.
If not, more work for you.


00:19:47.186 --> 00:19:49.321 line:95%,end
Hi. I need to get my nails done.

00:19:49.388 --> 00:19:50.989 line:95%,end
Are you getting them done
for anything special?

00:19:51.056 --> 00:19:52.925 line:95%,end
I don't know.
I might have a date, not sure.

00:19:52.991 --> 00:19:53.992 line:95%,end
Uh-oh.

00:19:54.059 --> 00:19:56.228 line:95%,end
Anything I do to pamper myself,
it's my nails. That's it.

00:19:56.295 --> 00:19:57.729 line:95%,end
- Gotta have them looking good.
- ABBY: That's it.

00:19:57.796 --> 00:19:59.965 line:5%,start
I don't get a lot of time
away from the studio,

00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:03.702 line:5%,start
so if I see a chance
to pamper myself, I take it.

00:20:03.769 --> 00:20:04.937 line:95%,end
Yeah, isn't this great?

00:20:05.003 --> 00:20:06.638 line:95%,end
Here they are. The three blind mice.

00:20:06.705 --> 00:20:08.006 line:95%,end
- How are you?
- Hi.

00:20:08.774 --> 00:20:10.242 line:95%,end
Oh, are you have a little sip of wine?

00:20:10.309 --> 00:20:12.110 line:95%,end
Chill. I'll have you know that it's water.

00:20:12.177 --> 00:20:14.479 line:95%,end
JILL: You should have--
this is your day for relaxation.

00:20:14.546 --> 00:20:16.048 line:95%,end
ABBY: I know,
but I have to go to the dance studio

00:20:16.114 --> 00:20:17.783 line:95%,end
and deal with your children.
You want me all liquored up?

00:20:17.849 --> 00:20:20.219 line:95%,end
All the more reason to be all liquored up.

00:20:20.285 --> 00:20:23.956 line:95%,end
What you fail to realize is that you're
usually not that happy at the studio.

00:20:24.022 --> 00:20:25.891 line:95%,end
I'm not that happy
because you're all there.

00:20:26.491 --> 00:20:28.160 line:95%,end
[laughs]

00:20:28.227 --> 00:20:31.530 line:5%,start
Abby doesn't want to admit it,
but she really needs our help.

00:20:31.597 --> 00:20:32.731 line:95%,end
Oh, that might be nice, Abby.

00:20:32.798 --> 00:20:34.866 line:95%,end
- Jill?
- That looks-- just bear with me.

00:20:34.933 --> 00:20:37.502 line:95%,end
Jill. I got one thing going for me,
and it's cleavage.

00:20:37.569 --> 00:20:39.605 line:95%,end
- [laughter]
- I'm not covering it up.

00:20:39.671 --> 00:20:41.440 line:95%,end
She's trying to choke me to death.

00:20:41.506 --> 00:20:44.042 line:95%,end
I'm 40-something years old.
I can dress myself.

00:20:44.109 --> 00:20:46.311 line:95%,end
You guys are making a big deal about this.

00:20:46.378 --> 00:20:48.747 line:95%,end
- It's just a little, casual--
- It's because we're happy for you.

00:20:48.814 --> 00:20:50.415 line:95%,end
--hey, let's go have dinner thing.

00:20:50.482 --> 00:20:55.187 line:95%,end
Now the moms want to live vicariously
through me, instead of their daughters.

00:20:55.254 --> 00:20:57.022 line:95%,end
I mean, come on. Has it been that long

00:20:57.089 --> 00:20:58.991 line:95%,end
since they've been on a date
with their husbands?

00:20:59.057 --> 00:21:00.692 line:95%,end
Oh, this is like Abby's prom.

00:21:00.759 --> 00:21:02.861 line:95%,end
- HOLLY: I know.
- Oh, stop. You're ridiculous.

00:21:02.928 --> 00:21:04.129 line:95%,end
[interposing voices]

00:21:04.196 --> 00:21:06.265 line:95%,end
Are you going to do something
special with your hair?

00:21:06.331 --> 00:21:07.332 line:95%,end
Yeah, I mean--

00:21:07.399 --> 00:21:09.301 line:95%,end
Like color it fifty shades of gray,
like you?

00:21:09.368 --> 00:21:11.303 line:95%,end
I don't have gray hair!

00:21:12.004 --> 00:21:13.939 line:5%,start
You know what, we're here to help Abby.

00:21:14.006 --> 00:21:16.708 line:5%,start
It would be nice
if she showed us a little gratitude.

00:21:16.775 --> 00:21:18.410 line:95%,end
So have you decided
what you're wearing tonight?

00:21:18.477 --> 00:21:19.678 line:95%,end
I'm going to wear a black shirt.

00:21:19.745 --> 00:21:21.613 line:95%,end
And I'm going to wear
some rhinestone jewelry bling.

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.348 line:95%,end
And I'm going to probably go to dinner.
And that's it.

00:21:23.415 --> 00:21:25.584 line:95%,end
That sounds like what you wear
to the dance studio.

00:21:25.651 --> 00:21:27.486 line:95%,end
JILL: What are you going to do
if he shows up with a baseball cap?

00:21:27.552 --> 00:21:29.354 line:95%,end
He won't, Jill.

00:21:29.421 --> 00:21:30.555 line:95%,end
He won't.
He's cool.

00:21:30.622 --> 00:21:33.325 line:95%,end
I keep telling you, inside,
I'm like a size 6 Prada.

00:21:33.392 --> 00:21:35.560 line:95%,end
You just don't get it. I like the LA guys.

00:21:35.627 --> 00:21:37.729 line:95%,end
I like-- but I like
the dumb jock guys too,

00:21:37.796 --> 00:21:39.998 line:95%,end
that have to go to the gym
all the time and just [grunts].

00:21:40.065 --> 00:21:42.734 line:95%,end
- So he's not a dancer?
- I don't know. That's a good question.

00:21:42.801 --> 00:21:45.003 line:95%,end
I'll have to ask him.
I forgot. I don't know.

00:21:46.038 --> 00:21:49.141 line:95%,end
- HOLLY: Put a ring on it.
- [laughter]

00:21:50.676 --> 00:21:52.044 line:95%,end
JILL: Or maybe it's this.

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:53.312 line:95%,end
- Jill!
- What is wrong with her?

00:21:53.378 --> 00:21:54.846 line:95%,end
ABBY: Jill, there's people here.

00:21:54.913 --> 00:21:56.615 line:95%,end
This is just all too much.

00:21:56.682 --> 00:21:59.418 line:95%,end
My personal life is my personal life.

00:21:59.484 --> 00:22:01.420 line:95%,end
They need to worry about their girls

00:22:01.486 --> 00:22:03.488 line:95%,end
working their butts off
for the hip hop routine.

00:22:03.555 --> 00:22:04.756 line:95%,end
We got to get going, Abby.

00:22:04.823 --> 00:22:06.558 line:95%,end
I'm so sorry they interrupted.

00:22:06.625 --> 00:22:08.427 line:95%,end
You had to watch Jill bump
and grinding over here.

00:22:08.493 --> 00:22:09.561 line:95%,end
- I loved it.
- JILL: So sorry.

00:22:09.628 --> 00:22:10.662 line:95%,end
You made me do it.

00:22:10.729 --> 00:22:11.763 line:95%,end
- Bye, ladies.
- Bye, enjoy.

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:14.166 line:95%,end
- This is so beautiful.
- They really want to help you get ready.

00:22:14.232 --> 00:22:15.233 line:95%,end
ABBY: They're nuts.

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:24.142 line:5%,start
So it's [vocalizing].

00:22:24.209 --> 00:22:25.377 line:5%,start
Then step through.

00:22:25.444 --> 00:22:27.713 line:95%,end
Maddie's doing a new solo
called "Uphill Battle."

00:22:27.779 --> 00:22:30.549 line:95%,end
This is a little different
than what she usually does.

00:22:30.615 --> 00:22:33.919 line:95%,end
It's hard-hitting. It's edgy.
It's a little darker.

00:22:33.985 --> 00:22:35.387 line:95%,end
Toes under on that.

00:22:35.454 --> 00:22:38.590 line:95%,end
MELISSA (VOICEOVER): I'm watching Maddie,
and her dance looks great.

00:22:38.657 --> 00:22:41.927 line:5%,start
Lots of new things in her dance,
which I think is great.

00:22:41.993 --> 00:22:45.530 line:95%,end
Maddie looks on YouTube
and always wants to try something new.

00:22:46.164 --> 00:22:47.165 line:95%,end
It's exciting.

00:22:48.734 --> 00:22:49.735 line:95%,end
Nice.

00:22:49.801 --> 00:22:51.470 line:95%,end
Maddie's going to go on that stage

00:22:51.536 --> 00:22:55.407 line:95%,end
and have to really be over the top
with her emotional execution.

00:22:55.474 --> 00:22:58.410 line:95%,end
It's like you're fighting
an uphill battle. Get it?

00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:01.113 line:95%,end
Alright. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.


00:23:07.986 --> 00:23:09.588 line:95%,end
But what else are you wearing
besides black?

00:23:09.654 --> 00:23:11.890 line:95%,end
I thought you were doing
a different color besides black.

00:23:11.957 --> 00:23:13.325 line:95%,end
- No.
- HOLLY: What about your neck?

00:23:13.392 --> 00:23:16.027 line:95%,end
- I've been teaching all day, Holly.
- I know, but--

00:23:16.094 --> 00:23:17.462 line:95%,end
I'm just going to grab something to eat.

00:23:17.529 --> 00:23:19.164 line:95%,end
You want red, red lips.

00:23:19.231 --> 00:23:21.166 line:95%,end
- Oh, red lips would be good.
- You need red lips.

00:23:21.233 --> 00:23:23.535 line:95%,end
Jill, I've been doing this a long time.

00:23:23.602 --> 00:23:25.804 line:5%,start
- Hello.
- RECEPTIONIST: Hi, can I help you?

00:23:25.871 --> 00:23:28.974 line:5%,start
- I'm here for Abby, to pick up Abby.
- Okay. What's your name?

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:30.609 line:95%,end
- Louie.
- Louie. Okay.

00:23:30.675 --> 00:23:32.944 line:95%,end
- [screaming]
- JILL: Where did you get that?

00:23:33.011 --> 00:23:34.379 line:95%,end
You're ruining your look!

00:23:34.446 --> 00:23:36.148 line:95%,end
- Oh, my god.
- JILL: She's so excited.

00:23:38.683 --> 00:23:39.918 line:95%,end
- I have Tic Tacs.
- Just saying--

00:23:39.985 --> 00:23:40.986 line:95%,end
I'll have a Tic Tac.

00:23:41.052 --> 00:23:43.555 line:95%,end
Maybe you can save it for later.
You never know.

00:23:43.622 --> 00:23:44.923 line:95%,end
- HOLLY: On a first date?
- It's a first date!

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:47.926 line:95%,end
I didn't run a credit check or anything!

00:23:47.993 --> 00:23:49.561 line:95%,end
JILL: You never know!

00:23:49.628 --> 00:23:51.830 line:95%,end
These moms are making
such a big deal out of this.

00:23:51.897 --> 00:23:53.398 line:95%,end
It's not the senior prom.

00:23:53.465 --> 00:23:57.169 line:95%,end
It's dinner with some guy
I'm probably never going to see again.

00:23:58.003 --> 00:23:59.538 line:95%,end
Moms, calm down.

00:24:00.305 --> 00:24:03.742 line:95%,end
HOLLY: A nice handshake
or a kiss on the cheek is just fine.

00:24:03.809 --> 00:24:05.210 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Did you put deodorant on?

00:24:05.277 --> 00:24:07.312 line:95%,end
I don't sweat. I glisten.

00:24:07.379 --> 00:24:08.647 line:95%,end
[laughs]

00:24:10.182 --> 00:24:12.117 line:95%,end
- Your date is here.
- Oh!

00:24:12.184 --> 00:24:14.052 line:95%,end
We'll be like the Welcome Wagon.

00:24:15.253 --> 00:24:17.255 line:95%,end
- Oh, hi!
- LOUIE: Hello.

00:24:17.322 --> 00:24:19.024 line:95%,end
- Are you here to see Abby?
- LOUIE: Yes.

00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:21.927 line:95%,end
- Yeah, I was calling for her.
- Oh, she's going to hate those jeans.

00:24:21.993 --> 00:24:24.229 line:95%,end
- Oh!
- Should I take them off?

00:24:24.296 --> 00:24:26.998 line:95%,end
- HOLLY: No, no.
- JILL: I think you look really nice.

00:24:27.065 --> 00:24:28.300 line:95%,end
It's the holes, but--

00:24:28.366 --> 00:24:30.135 line:95%,end
LOUIE: I fell in the pothole
in the parking lot.

00:24:30.202 --> 00:24:31.770 line:95%,end
JILL: I like him already!

00:24:31.837 --> 00:24:34.372 line:95%,end
So, the story she told was amazing,

00:24:34.439 --> 00:24:36.842 line:95%,end
that you two just happened
to be pumping gas.

00:24:36.908 --> 00:24:38.944 line:95%,end
- And I helped her pump her gas.
- MELISSA: That's nice.

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:41.112 line:95%,end
- I'm pretty helpful.
- She likes helpers.

00:24:41.179 --> 00:24:42.848 line:95%,end
- LOUIE: She likes helpers?
- MELISSA: Oh, yes.

00:24:42.914 --> 00:24:46.151 line:95%,end
She loves, like, to snap her fingers
and let people do everything for her.

00:24:46.218 --> 00:24:50.422 line:95%,end
- Oh, really?
- And she'll talk a lot about herself.

00:24:50.489 --> 00:24:53.258 line:95%,end
I know.
Pull out her chair at the restaurant.

00:24:53.325 --> 00:24:55.026 line:95%,end
- I always do that anyway.
- MELISSA: Okay, good.

00:24:55.093 --> 00:24:56.394 line:95%,end
Oh, good. Then she did good.

00:24:56.461 --> 00:24:58.497 line:95%,end
HOLLY: The car door, the restaurant door,
be a gentleman.

00:24:58.563 --> 00:25:00.432 line:95%,end
- Yes.
- HOLLY: Yeah, she will like that.

00:25:00.499 --> 00:25:02.234 line:95%,end
- I think he's alright.
- LOUIE: okay, good.

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:03.301 line:95%,end
[interposing voices]

00:25:03.368 --> 00:25:05.003 line:95%,end
- It was nice meeting you.
- JILL: You too.

00:25:08.139 --> 00:25:09.140 line:95%,end
Hmm.

00:25:10.075 --> 00:25:11.843 line:95%,end
- We met him
- ABBY: Oh, you did?

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:13.979 line:95%,end
- He's really sweet.
- Very stylish.

00:25:14.045 --> 00:25:15.647 line:95%,end
He has a bow tie on.

00:25:15.714 --> 00:25:17.415 line:95%,end
- And a nice--
- He's dressed?

00:25:17.482 --> 00:25:18.717 line:95%,end
No, jeans.

00:25:18.783 --> 00:25:21.052 line:95%,end
- HOLLY: He's clean.
- He's clean.

00:25:21.119 --> 00:25:22.821 line:95%,end
Did you make him cough too?

00:25:22.888 --> 00:25:25.457 line:95%,end
- [laughs]
- 8How tall is he?

00:25:25.524 --> 00:25:27.092 line:95%,end
(WHISPERING) Not very tall.
You might be taller.

00:25:27.158 --> 00:25:29.461 line:95%,end
- Oh, no.
- JILL: No, he's not that tall.

00:25:29.528 --> 00:25:32.297 line:95%,end
- Did you not see him?
- I was in the car!

00:25:32.364 --> 00:25:34.165 line:95%,end
He said, want some help?
I'll take care of it.

00:25:34.232 --> 00:25:35.300 line:95%,end
I said, fine.

00:25:36.034 --> 00:25:38.069 line:95%,end
So I wasn't, like, standing next to him.

00:25:38.136 --> 00:25:40.505 line:95%,end
Louie. We forgot to ask.
I think he's Italian.

00:25:40.572 --> 00:25:42.374 line:95%,end
- What would you say?
- HOLLY: Oh, I don't know.

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.409 line:95%,end
I think he's very excited about your date.

00:25:44.476 --> 00:25:46.244 line:95%,end
Oh, well. It's just dinner, girls.

00:25:46.311 --> 00:25:48.747 line:95%,end
- HOLLY: So have fun. Enjoy.
- ABBY: okay, thank you.

00:25:49.881 --> 00:25:52.150 line:95%,end
- Hey, how are you doing?
- Hey, hello, hello.

00:25:52.217 --> 00:25:54.853 line:95%,end
ABBY (VOICEOVER): Louie is
not exactly as how I remember him.

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:57.489 line:95%,end
He's much, uh, more petite.

00:25:57.556 --> 00:25:58.857 line:95%,end
- You ready?
- Yeah, I am.

00:25:58.924 --> 00:26:01.259 line:95%,end
But you know what,
I don't know where my purse is.

00:26:02.294 --> 00:26:03.795 line:95%,end
Do you have it? Okay.

00:26:03.862 --> 00:26:06.831 line:95%,end
- It's hard. I've been teaching all day.
- Right on.

00:26:06.898 --> 00:26:08.400 line:95%,end
Alright. Where are we going?

00:26:08.466 --> 00:26:10.368 line:95%,end
- Right down the road.
- Okay, cool.

00:26:10.435 --> 00:26:12.537 line:95%,end
- Thank you. See you, honey.
- Bye!

00:26:12.604 --> 00:26:13.905 line:95%,end
LOUIE: Nice to meet you. Bye-bye.

00:26:13.972 --> 00:26:15.006 line:95%,end
They're your friends?

00:26:15.073 --> 00:26:17.042 line:95%,end
ABBY (VOICEOVER): No, they're not
my friends. They're my customers.

00:26:17.108 --> 00:26:19.010 line:95%,end
- MELISSA: More, more.
- Little kiss good night.


00:26:24.849 --> 00:26:25.984 line:5%,start
ABBY (VOICEOVER):
So have you been here before?

00:26:26.051 --> 00:26:28.787 line:95%,end
No, but I did rent the whole joint out.

00:26:28.853 --> 00:26:30.689 line:95%,end
- What?
- I have a sweetheart.

00:26:30.755 --> 00:26:33.058 line:95%,end
- Thank you! Well, that's nice!
- Yeah, that's how I roll.

00:26:33.124 --> 00:26:35.427 line:95%,end
Good. Then we don't have
to worry about being loud.

00:26:35.493 --> 00:26:36.928 line:95%,end
No, be as loud as you want.

00:26:36.995 --> 00:26:39.497 line:95%,end
Hey, this is really nice.

00:26:39.564 --> 00:26:42.601 line:5%,start
There's a candlelit table in the corner.

00:26:42.667 --> 00:26:44.035 line:95%,end
I'm ready to be wined and dined.

00:26:44.102 --> 00:26:47.706 line:95%,end
So what, uh, what is your type of guy?
What are you looking for?

00:26:47.772 --> 00:26:50.141 line:95%,end
Well, I have the same type of guy
everybody else is looking for.

00:26:50.208 --> 00:26:51.276 line:95%,end
Ah.

00:26:51.343 --> 00:26:54.312 line:95%,end
Somebody that's honest,
makes an honest living,

00:26:54.379 --> 00:26:56.014 line:95%,end
works hard at their job, passionate.

00:26:56.081 --> 00:26:59.584 line:95%,end
So you're not in a relationship right now,
obviously.

00:26:59.651 --> 00:27:02.387 line:95%,end
Well, kind of have a long distance.

00:27:02.454 --> 00:27:03.888 line:95%,end
We all have a long distance.

00:27:04.823 --> 00:27:06.524 line:95%,end
It's good to have a long distance.

00:27:07.559 --> 00:27:09.294 line:95%,end
It keeps it out there.

00:27:09.361 --> 00:27:11.229 line:95%,end
- So I'm writing a book.
- ABBY: You're writing a book?

00:27:11.296 --> 00:27:12.664 line:95%,end
- I am going to write a book.
- I'm writing a book!

00:27:12.731 --> 00:27:15.700 line:95%,end
Oh, really? It's about relationships.
I'm very good.

00:27:15.767 --> 00:27:18.603 line:95%,end
I see I'm on the verge
of figuring women out.

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:20.338 line:95%,end
[laughs]

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:30.749 line:95%,end
LOUIE: So my book will help.

00:27:30.815 --> 00:27:33.451 line:95%,end
[laughs]

00:27:33.518 --> 00:27:35.520 line:95%,end
I like a guy that can make me laugh.

00:27:35.587 --> 00:27:37.956 line:95%,end
There's not enough laughter in my life.

00:27:38.023 --> 00:27:39.958 line:95%,end
And frankly, I like to have fun.

00:27:40.025 --> 00:27:42.661 line:95%,end
- [gasps]
- WAITER: This is the chef's specialty.

00:27:42.727 --> 00:27:44.729 line:95%,end
It's Chocolate Eruption.

00:27:44.796 --> 00:27:46.131 line:95%,end
Eruption.

00:27:46.197 --> 00:27:48.033 line:95%,end
Wow. One of my favorite words.

00:27:48.099 --> 00:27:49.768 line:95%,end
- It is?
- I have about 12 favorite words.

00:27:49.834 --> 00:27:51.202 line:95%,end
ABBY: Oh, really?
Can you name them?

00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:52.771 line:95%,end
Not on-- right now.

00:27:52.837 --> 00:27:54.739 line:95%,end
- [laughs]
- WAITER: Enjoy.

00:27:54.806 --> 00:27:56.908 line:95%,end
- You can have the first bite.
- ABBY: Mm-mm.

00:28:00.679 --> 00:28:01.680 line:95%,end
Is that good?

00:28:04.282 --> 00:28:06.418 line:95%,end
- So tell me about your dance background.
- Yeah.

00:28:06.484 --> 00:28:08.486 line:95%,end
Dance back--
I have a slight dance background.

00:28:08.553 --> 00:28:09.554 line:95%,end
Tell me.

00:28:11.589 --> 00:28:13.024 line:95%,end
Yeah.

00:28:13.091 --> 00:28:14.359 line:95%,end
Yeah, I was a male stripper.

00:28:14.426 --> 00:28:16.161 line:95%,end
- ABBY: No, you weren't.
- Yeah, for a little bit.

00:28:17.162 --> 00:28:18.163 line:95%,end
They made me do it.

00:28:18.997 --> 00:28:20.331 line:95%,end
Come on.
Are we going to dance on this table?

00:28:20.398 --> 00:28:21.900 line:95%,end
No, I am not dancing on this table.

00:28:21.966 --> 00:28:23.168 line:95%,end
- ABBY: Why?
- I'll break it.

00:28:23.234 --> 00:28:24.235 line:95%,end
Wuss.

00:28:24.302 --> 00:28:28.206 line:95%,end
[laughs] I am 180 pounds
of twisted steel and sex appeal.

00:28:28.273 --> 00:28:30.075 line:95%,end
- [laughs]
- This table will crack.

00:28:30.141 --> 00:28:32.677 line:95%,end
Twisted steel and sex appeal.

00:28:32.744 --> 00:28:34.746 line:95%,end
- I'm just saying.
- Whoo-hoo!

00:28:41.619 --> 00:28:43.588 line:95%,end
- Hey.
- Hello.

00:28:45.457 --> 00:28:47.892 line:95%,end
It's like the evil sisters.

00:28:47.959 --> 00:28:50.261 line:95%,end
Holly, Melissa, and Jill are relentless.

00:28:50.328 --> 00:28:52.430 line:95%,end
They want to know all about my date.

00:28:52.497 --> 00:28:54.632 line:95%,end
Ladies, none of your business.

00:28:54.699 --> 00:28:56.034 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Okay, so tell us
what happened on your date.

00:28:56.101 --> 00:28:57.635 line:95%,end
Yeah, let us come and check in.

00:28:57.702 --> 00:29:02.107 line:95%,end
Normally I would drive my own car,
my own keys, my own transportation.

00:29:02.173 --> 00:29:04.442 line:95%,end
- And he drove you.
- Just saying.

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:06.311 line:95%,end
Just saying.

00:29:06.377 --> 00:29:07.412 line:95%,end
Is he smaller than you?

00:29:08.113 --> 00:29:09.481 line:95%,end
[laughs] Smaller.

00:29:11.816 --> 00:29:13.084 line:95%,end
Well, I'm glad you had fun. I'm glad--

00:29:13.151 --> 00:29:14.352 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Where did you go?
What did you do?

00:29:14.419 --> 00:29:17.055 line:95%,end
ABBY: We went over to that Flowers
in the Attic, that restaurant.

00:29:17.122 --> 00:29:19.557 line:95%,end
- Oh, that's a charming place.
- It's kind of romantic, isn't it?

00:29:19.624 --> 00:29:21.559 line:95%,end
It's charming. I don't know.

00:29:23.828 --> 00:29:25.830 line:95%,end
I'm not the antique-y kind of girl.

00:29:25.897 --> 00:29:27.565 line:95%,end
I like clean, modern.

00:29:27.632 --> 00:29:29.100 line:95%,end
- Yes, you do.
- You know.

00:29:29.167 --> 00:29:31.035 line:95%,end
But it was very nice. He was funny.

00:29:31.102 --> 00:29:32.971 line:95%,end
- MELISSA: He seemed it.
- ABBY: I laughed.

00:29:33.037 --> 00:29:37.175 line:95%,end
- MELISSA: Oh, what was--
- I-- I haven't laughed in a long time.

00:29:37.242 --> 00:29:38.777 line:95%,end
And I really laughed. It was so funny.

00:29:38.843 --> 00:29:41.946 line:95%,end
I think I was kind of laughing at him
instead of with him, but you know.

00:29:43.548 --> 00:29:46.651 line:95%,end
He thought that he was just hot stuff.

00:29:46.718 --> 00:29:50.955 line:95%,end
He referred to himself as 180 pounds

00:29:51.022 --> 00:29:53.725 line:95%,end
of twisted steel and sex appeal.

00:29:53.792 --> 00:29:55.460 line:95%,end
You know he's a former male stripper.

00:29:55.527 --> 00:29:57.095 line:95%,end
Shut up.

00:29:57.162 --> 00:30:01.065 line:95%,end
When I found out that he was
a former professional dancer,

00:30:01.132 --> 00:30:03.701 line:95%,end
I was like, who did you tour with?
Celine Dion?

00:30:04.435 --> 00:30:05.670 line:95%,end
You know, come on.

00:30:05.737 --> 00:30:08.039 line:95%,end
ABBY (VOICEOVER):
Do I see Louie in my future?

00:30:08.106 --> 00:30:10.642 line:95%,end
I don't know.
I need more laughter in my life.

00:30:10.708 --> 00:30:12.710 line:95%,end
So I might just keep him around.

00:30:12.777 --> 00:30:14.245 line:95%,end
I'll tell you why.

00:30:14.312 --> 00:30:17.348 line:95%,end
I didn't care
if I ever saw another kid dance.

00:30:17.415 --> 00:30:19.617 line:95%,end
I was so glad to get out
of this studio last night.

00:30:20.485 --> 00:30:24.122 line:95%,end
Let's just say
I teach the girls almost everything.

00:30:25.423 --> 00:30:27.025 line:95%,end
[exclamations]

00:30:27.091 --> 00:30:29.194 line:95%,end
Love dance.

00:30:31.262 --> 00:30:33.264 line:95%,end
- Okay.
- Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

00:30:41.239 --> 00:30:43.208 line:5%,start
- Hey, Brooke. How you doing?
- Good.


00:30:43.274 --> 00:30:44.509 line:5%,start
You're going to Minnesota.

00:30:44.576 --> 00:30:46.678 line:95%,end
This is where the dance studios

00:30:46.744 --> 00:30:50.081 line:95%,end
that have 1,200 students, 2,000 students.

00:30:50.148 --> 00:30:52.550 line:95%,end
So you're going to be up against
some pretty amazing kids.

00:30:52.617 --> 00:30:55.653 line:95%,end
The name of your routine
is "Arm Yourself."

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.355 line:95%,end
They're not talking about your arms.

00:30:58.389 --> 00:31:01.693 line:95%,end
They're talking about
have your secret weapon.

00:31:01.759 --> 00:31:04.229 line:95%,end
Know how to get out of a situation.

00:31:04.295 --> 00:31:06.798 line:95%,end
Yes? So let's see it.

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:11.870 line:95%,end
ABBY (VOICEOVER): Brooke knows
that she was born to be a dancer.

00:31:11.936 --> 00:31:15.974 line:95%,end
She knows that she can do acrobatic tricks
that not too many people can do.

00:31:17.175 --> 00:31:19.510 line:95%,end
ABBY: Roll forward and hold.

00:31:19.577 --> 00:31:22.213 line:95%,end
Collapse. Bend that knee.
Arch up.

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:23.481 line:95%,end
Hold.

00:31:23.548 --> 00:31:25.516 line:95%,end
ABBY (VOICEOVER): And I keep
throwing her on top of that pyramid,

00:31:25.583 --> 00:31:28.987 line:95%,end
hoping someday she might
just rise to the occasion.

00:31:39.197 --> 00:31:40.865 line:95%,end
ABBY: Okay, Brooke, you're finished.

00:31:40.932 --> 00:31:42.634 line:95%,end
Good work. I will see you tomorrow.

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:46.170 line:95%,end
And we need to finish it tomorrow,
because you only have two more days

00:31:46.237 --> 00:31:49.240 line:95%,end
before you're in Minnesota
against all those amazing kids.

00:31:49.307 --> 00:31:52.610 line:95%,end
Be prepared. Arm yourself.
Get it?

00:31:53.912 --> 00:31:58.116 line:95%,end
The more information you have,
the stronger you can be. Okay.

00:32:06.991 --> 00:32:11.629 line:5%,start
I decided to get Kendall
some new and improved headshots,

00:32:11.696 --> 00:32:15.867 line:95%,end
something maybe a little different,
a little bit snappier than the others.

00:32:15.934 --> 00:32:17.869 line:95%,end
I want something dynamic.

00:32:17.936 --> 00:32:22.307 line:95%,end
I want something that jumps off
that pyramid and says, here I am!

00:32:22.373 --> 00:32:23.574 line:95%,end
I want to be number one.

00:32:23.641 --> 00:32:25.043 line:95%,end
Ow.

00:32:25.109 --> 00:32:27.545 line:95%,end
- I think you're pulling all my hair out.
- Sorry, sweetheart. Sorry.

00:32:27.612 --> 00:32:30.815 line:95%,end
I know that Kendall gets a little uptight
when I'm always fixing her hair.

00:32:30.882 --> 00:32:33.017 line:95%,end
Could you shush, Mom?

00:32:33.084 --> 00:32:34.419 line:95%,end
It's hard being beautiful.

00:32:34.485 --> 00:32:37.055 line:95%,end
JILL (VOICEOVER):
I want her to look her 100% best.

00:32:37.121 --> 00:32:40.992 line:95%,end
It's my job, as her mom, to get in there
and make sure that happens.

00:32:41.059 --> 00:32:43.861 line:95%,end
PHOTOGRAPHER: That's good. Right there.
That's it. Good, good, good.

00:32:43.928 --> 00:32:45.330 line:95%,end
Turn your head a little bit. Perfect.

00:32:45.396 --> 00:32:47.031 line:95%,end
- What a great shot, Kendall.
- JILL: Oh, I love that one.

00:32:47.098 --> 00:32:48.499 line:95%,end
PHOTOGRAPHER: That's beautiful.
You nailed it.

00:32:48.566 --> 00:32:51.903 line:95%,end
JILL (VOICEOVER): I would love
for other opportunities to come from this.

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:55.039 line:95%,end
I would love for her
to show up in commercials,

00:32:55.106 --> 00:32:56.908 line:95%,end
do some print work, anything.

00:32:56.975 --> 00:32:58.509 line:95%,end
JILL: That look like a superstar to you?

00:32:58.576 --> 00:33:00.745 line:95%,end
Give me happy with that.
That's it. Very nice.

00:33:00.812 --> 00:33:03.314 line:95%,end
The sky's the limit, and now is the time.

00:33:03.381 --> 00:33:06.918 line:95%,end
I've got to take advantage
of this beautiful little girl right now.

00:33:06.985 --> 00:33:08.219 line:95%,end
Can I get one with Kendall?

00:33:08.286 --> 00:33:10.088 line:95%,end
- Can I get in?
- Sure, that'd be awesome.

00:33:10.154 --> 00:33:11.823 line:95%,end
Go ahead,
snuggle in there with her for one.

00:33:11.889 --> 00:33:14.625 line:95%,end
That's very nice. Let's grab another.
What a great shot.

00:33:14.692 --> 00:33:17.161 line:95%,end
- You're gonna airbrush me, right?
- Uh-huh.

00:33:17.228 --> 00:33:18.696 line:95%,end
That's 1, 2, 3.

00:33:18.763 --> 00:33:19.797 line:95%,end
Nicely done.

00:33:19.864 --> 00:33:21.132 line:95%,end
Here, hop up one sec.

00:33:23.868 --> 00:33:25.336 line:95%,end
That's it. Good. Good, good, good.

00:33:25.403 --> 00:33:27.338 line:95%,end
Turn your head to your left
one little notch.

00:33:27.405 --> 00:33:28.406 line:95%,end
Very nice.

00:33:33.611 --> 00:33:34.979 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Melissa, I'm excited,

00:33:35.046 --> 00:33:38.082 line:95%,end
and actually a little surprised
that you agreed to do this.

00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:39.384 line:95%,end
Why?

00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:42.754 line:95%,end
Because last time we tried to take you
to a wedding shop, you were like--

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:45.289 line:95%,end
- MELISSA: That was a year ago.
- Do not speak to me about weddings,

00:33:45.356 --> 00:33:47.325 line:95%,end
and here's a letter from my attorney.

00:33:47.392 --> 00:33:52.530 line:5%,start
It wasn't that long ago that just asking
about Melissa's diamond on her hand

00:33:52.597 --> 00:33:56.801 line:95%,end
resulted in us getting a letter
threatening draconian legal action.

00:33:56.868 --> 00:33:59.070 line:95%,end
And now we want to take her
to buy a dress?

00:33:59.137 --> 00:34:01.072 line:95%,end
Like, are you ladies serious?

00:34:01.139 --> 00:34:03.041 line:95%,end
We're friends now,
so things are a little different.

00:34:03.107 --> 00:34:04.642 line:95%,end
- Oh.
- And it's--

00:34:04.709 --> 00:34:07.845 line:95%,end
- Hey, I thought I was your friend then!
- You were my friend then.

00:34:07.912 --> 00:34:11.049 line:5%,start
Now I'm inviting all the moms
into my life a little more.

00:34:11.115 --> 00:34:13.751 line:5%,start
And you know,
we're kind of open books now.

00:34:13.818 --> 00:34:15.253 line:95%,end
We tell each other everything.

00:34:21.559 --> 00:34:23.561 line:95%,end
[exclamations]

00:34:25.063 --> 00:34:27.231 line:95%,end
- This is for you.
- Thank you.

00:34:27.298 --> 00:34:28.366 line:95%,end
This is for you.

00:34:28.433 --> 00:34:30.935 line:95%,end
JILL (VOICEOVER): I wanted Melissa
to feel good about herself.

00:34:31.002 --> 00:34:36.274 line:95%,end
There's no reason to hold grudges
or be worried about secrets.

00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:39.010 line:95%,end
Let's just put the past behind us

00:34:39.077 --> 00:34:41.946 line:95%,end
and move forward and make this good.

00:34:42.013 --> 00:34:43.147 line:95%,end
- Cheers!
- Oh, that's a big--

00:34:43.214 --> 00:34:45.249 line:95%,end
- Cheers!
- MELISSA: Thank you for coming.

00:34:45.316 --> 00:34:49.921 line:5%,start
Jill is very competitive,
even when it comes to a bridal shower.

00:34:49.987 --> 00:34:53.524 line:95%,end
So going to look at wedding dresses,
who brings in the best desserts,

00:34:53.591 --> 00:34:57.628 line:95%,end
who gets to help Melissa try on gowns,
whose idea was it,

00:34:57.695 --> 00:34:59.464 line:95%,end
everything could be a competition,

00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:04.168 line:95%,end
so I'm not surprised that Jill has
this take-charge kind of attitude.


00:35:04.235 --> 00:35:06.170 line:95%,end
What's from Holly?

00:35:06.237 --> 00:35:08.406 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Oh, that's so pretty.

00:35:08.473 --> 00:35:09.941 line:95%,end
JILL: Oh, you're so thoughtful, Holly.

00:35:10.007 --> 00:35:12.743 line:95%,end
- [interposing voices]
- Oh, beautiful. Love it.

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:14.512 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I know exactly where to put it.

00:35:14.579 --> 00:35:16.848 line:95%,end
- Is this-- this is from Christi?
- That one's from me.

00:35:16.914 --> 00:35:18.783 line:95%,end
- There's a little card in there.
- MELISSA: I wanted this.

00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:20.351 line:95%,end
- CHRISTI: Oh, ta-da!
- Ta-da!

00:35:20.418 --> 00:35:22.253 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Wait, now you have to take it
out of the box and hold it up.

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:24.122 line:95%,end
I love it.

00:35:25.256 --> 00:35:26.557 line:95%,end
This is from Jill.

00:35:26.624 --> 00:35:28.726 line:95%,end
[exclamations]

00:35:28.793 --> 00:35:31.329 line:95%,end
Thank you. I feel young.

00:35:31.395 --> 00:35:33.030 line:95%,end
This is from Kelly.

00:35:33.097 --> 00:35:35.633 line:95%,end
Oh, just married. Isn't that pretty?

00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:38.136 line:95%,end
I got the one that said just married
because I was confused,

00:35:38.202 --> 00:35:39.904 line:95%,end
because you wear your wedding band
all the time.

00:35:39.971 --> 00:35:42.473 line:95%,end
And I wasn't sure
if I missed the wedding or not.

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:44.442 line:95%,end
[laughter]

00:35:44.509 --> 00:35:47.245 line:5%,start
I don't know why Melissa is so secretive.

00:35:47.311 --> 00:35:48.980 line:95%,end
It's like she's afraid.

00:35:49.046 --> 00:35:52.283 line:95%,end
Like, what are you afraid of, Melissa?
Why won't you tell us?

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:53.351 line:95%,end
I like my ware.

00:35:53.417 --> 00:35:55.887 line:95%,end
I think it's bad luck to wear the wedding
band as you're trying on the dress.

00:35:55.953 --> 00:35:58.890 line:95%,end
And that bottle just goes with it.
It's your favorite wine.

00:35:58.956 --> 00:36:00.558 line:95%,end
Oh, good. Thank you.

00:36:00.625 --> 00:36:01.826 line:95%,end
MELISSA (VOICEOVER):
If I did decide to have a wedding,

00:36:01.893 --> 00:36:03.861 line:95%,end
it's just going to be very intimate.

00:36:03.928 --> 00:36:06.597 line:95%,end
And it's just going to be
basically my family and I.

00:36:06.664 --> 00:36:09.400 line:95%,end
Let's practice tossing the bouquet. Okay.

00:36:09.467 --> 00:36:11.269 line:95%,end
- Oh, god!
- Come on.

00:36:11.335 --> 00:36:13.671 line:95%,end
Jill will kill a bitch to get that thing.

00:36:13.738 --> 00:36:15.640 line:95%,end
- [laughs]
- Because it's all about the win.

00:36:15.706 --> 00:36:17.742 line:95%,end
Well, put it this way.
I could get it if I wanted it.

00:36:18.743 --> 00:36:20.244 line:95%,end
CHRISTI (VOICEOVER):
We're a bunch of middle-aged women

00:36:20.311 --> 00:36:21.679 line:95%,end
lunging for a bouquet.

00:36:21.746 --> 00:36:24.115 line:95%,end
This could be potentially hazardous.
Someone could break a hip.

00:36:24.182 --> 00:36:25.583 line:95%,end
[screams]

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:28.452 line:95%,end
[screaming and laughter]

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:31.289 line:95%,end
Oh, my god.

00:36:31.355 --> 00:36:32.356 line:95%,end
CHRISTI (VOICEOVER):
I think Kelly, Holly, and I

00:36:32.423 --> 00:36:34.025 line:95%,end
are having a little too much fun
at the bridal shop.

00:36:34.091 --> 00:36:37.328 line:95%,end
If we keep going, I think we're all going
to be trying on bride dresses.

00:36:38.062 --> 00:36:40.498 line:95%,end
Do you have an idea
as to what dress you want?

00:36:40.565 --> 00:36:43.167 line:95%,end
I wanted kind of something simple.

00:36:43.234 --> 00:36:45.970 line:95%,end
Something slim and sexy?
Something a little bit bigger?

00:36:46.037 --> 00:36:47.905 line:95%,end
The sexy, that's how you met him.

00:36:47.972 --> 00:36:50.608 line:95%,end
With cleavage down to here.

00:36:50.675 --> 00:36:51.842 line:95%,end
We know he likes that.

00:36:54.111 --> 00:36:55.613 line:95%,end
Let's try this one on.

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:58.649 line:95%,end
Okay, here she comes!

00:36:58.716 --> 00:37:00.318 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I don't like it,
but I'm going to show you.

00:37:00.384 --> 00:37:01.385 line:95%,end
Oh, love it.

00:37:01.452 --> 00:37:03.487 line:95%,end
It's not my-- it's not
really what I'm looking for.

00:37:03.554 --> 00:37:05.456 line:95%,end
KELLY: Definitely going
to need bigger than a 6.

00:37:05.523 --> 00:37:08.526 line:95%,end
- Oh, that's pretty.
- JILL: That's pretty, too.

00:37:08.593 --> 00:37:10.628 line:95%,end
I love the bottom.

00:37:10.695 --> 00:37:12.964 line:95%,end
- I love this dress.
- Oh, pretty.

00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:14.932 line:95%,end
And you know what?
Guess what color this comes in.

00:37:14.999 --> 00:37:16.000 line:95%,end
What, pink?

00:37:17.568 --> 00:37:20.238 line:95%,end
- CHRISTI: Oh, that's pretty.
- KELLY: Oh, I love that one too.

00:37:20.304 --> 00:37:21.973 line:95%,end
Yeah, that one's beautiful.

00:37:22.039 --> 00:37:25.042 line:95%,end
I think that that dress would be amazing
if you were, like, 23.

00:37:26.844 --> 00:37:28.946 line:95%,end
- And a virgin.
- [laughs]

00:37:29.981 --> 00:37:32.984 line:95%,end
I think all of these dresses
that Melissa are trying on are beautiful.

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:35.286 line:95%,end
And they're very pure.

00:37:35.353 --> 00:37:37.922 line:95%,end
And I think when you're
on your third marriage,

00:37:37.989 --> 00:37:39.757 line:95%,end
I don't know
if they're the appropriate choice.

00:37:39.824 --> 00:37:41.659 line:95%,end
This is the skinniest mirror
in all of America.

00:37:41.726 --> 00:37:43.828 line:95%,end
Would you sit your ass down and quit
admiring how skinny you are?

00:37:43.894 --> 00:37:45.696 line:95%,end
I love that mirror.

00:37:45.763 --> 00:37:47.698 line:95%,end
HOLLY: How do you like
we have to invite ourselves

00:37:47.765 --> 00:37:49.200 line:95%,end
to be part of her wedding party?

00:37:49.267 --> 00:37:52.536 line:95%,end
Me, of all people, probably shouldn't
be part of the wedding party.

00:37:52.603 --> 00:37:56.374 line:95%,end
I don't really think I should, considering
we usually fight like cats and dogs.

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.142 line:95%,end
Abby's probably her maid of honor.

00:37:58.209 --> 00:38:00.978 line:95%,end
We won't have fun if Abby's there.

00:38:01.045 --> 00:38:02.446 line:95%,end
No kidding!

00:38:02.513 --> 00:38:03.914 line:95%,end
Melissa!

00:38:03.981 --> 00:38:06.851 line:95%,end
You cannot invite Abby. It won't be fun!

00:38:06.917 --> 00:38:08.653 line:95%,end
- MELISSA: Okay, I'm naked.
- Oh.

00:38:08.719 --> 00:38:09.954 line:95%,end
Why are you naked?

00:38:10.021 --> 00:38:11.422 line:95%,end
Are you wearing undies?

00:38:11.489 --> 00:38:12.657 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Um, just my Spanx.

00:38:12.723 --> 00:38:14.659 line:95%,end
Well, you're already
one step ahead of Kelly.

00:38:16.861 --> 00:38:18.729 line:95%,end
HOLLY (VOICEOVER):
Going dress shopping with Melissa

00:38:18.796 --> 00:38:22.300 line:95%,end
is really a turning point,
I think, for all of us.

00:38:22.366 --> 00:38:24.302 line:95%,end
The fact that we were there
and we were able to share

00:38:24.368 --> 00:38:25.870 line:95%,end
in her joy, that's huge.

00:38:25.936 --> 00:38:28.839 line:95%,end
- Oh! [laughter]
- Oh, sorry.

00:38:28.906 --> 00:38:31.175 line:95%,end
KELLY: Shut up, you lush!

00:38:31.242 --> 00:38:34.345 line:95%,end
[laughs]

00:38:34.412 --> 00:38:36.147 line:95%,end
A few more drinks, and I think Dr. Holly

00:38:36.213 --> 00:38:38.783 line:95%,end
is going to be modeling
wedding night lingerie.

00:38:40.451 --> 00:38:42.086 line:95%,end
[exclamations]

00:38:42.153 --> 00:38:44.221 line:95%,end
- CHRISTI: Oh, it's pretty.
- MELISSA: I love this dress.

00:38:45.222 --> 00:38:46.357 line:95%,end
I'm sorry.

00:38:47.792 --> 00:38:48.926 line:95%,end
Oh.

00:38:48.993 --> 00:38:51.028 line:95%,end
I love this dress.

00:38:51.095 --> 00:38:53.964 line:95%,end
Look how gorgeous this is.

00:38:54.031 --> 00:38:55.533 line:95%,end
I love this dress.

00:38:55.599 --> 00:38:57.101 line:95%,end
You look like a princess.

00:38:57.168 --> 00:38:59.804 line:95%,end
I just would love for Greg
to see me in this dress.

00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:01.939 line:95%,end
Well, he can't see you in this dress.
It's bad luck!

00:39:02.006 --> 00:39:03.641 line:95%,end
I meant when I'm getting married.

00:39:05.409 --> 00:39:07.778 line:95%,end
I feel fabulous in this dress.

00:39:07.845 --> 00:39:10.948 line:95%,end
And it was so sweet of the moms
to take me dress shopping.

00:39:11.015 --> 00:39:12.950 line:95%,end
And I feel like a million bucks.


00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:21.792 line:5%,start
ABBY: Hi, girls. How you doing?

00:39:21.859 --> 00:39:22.993 line:5%,start
Good.

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:26.864 line:95%,end
I'm going to take Kenzie to the hospital,
but I just wanted to drop Maddie off.

00:39:26.931 --> 00:39:29.700 line:95%,end
- What do you mean, the hospital?
- Her foot is killing her.

00:39:29.767 --> 00:39:32.136 line:95%,end
I thought you did the dance last night
and it looked pretty good.

00:39:32.203 --> 00:39:33.204 line:95%,end
Still bothering you?

00:39:34.305 --> 00:39:36.273 line:95%,end
You need to get it looked at.
Go to the hospital.

00:39:37.174 --> 00:39:39.944 line:95%,end
Going to be needles and all kind of stuff.

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:41.145 line:95%,end
MELISSA: [laughs]

00:39:41.212 --> 00:39:42.513 line:5%,start
MELISSA (VOICEOVER): I'm concerned that

00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:44.682 line:5%,start
something might be broken
in Mackenzie's foot.

00:39:44.749 --> 00:39:46.083 line:95%,end
So I'm going to leave Maddie here

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:48.119 line:95%,end
and going to go take
Mackenzie to the hospital.

00:39:48.185 --> 00:39:51.155 line:95%,end
- Got it.
- I can't have a wounded soldier, can I?

00:39:52.356 --> 00:39:53.791 line:95%,end
This is the ALDC.

00:39:58.562 --> 00:40:00.297 line:5%,start
This is it! This is the last day.

00:40:00.364 --> 00:40:02.566 line:5%,start
Tomorrow you're on a plane
going to Minnesota.

00:40:02.633 --> 00:40:04.034 line:5%,start
This is all you get, kid.

00:40:04.101 --> 00:40:06.303 line:95%,end
You're going on that stage.

00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:08.539 line:95%,end
And, Kendall, beat Chloe.

00:40:08.606 --> 00:40:10.207 line:95%,end
She beat Chloe, she can beat you.

00:40:10.274 --> 00:40:11.409 line:95%,end
JILL: Where is Melissa?

00:40:11.475 --> 00:40:13.978 line:95%,end
Oh, she took Mackenzie to the doctor's.

00:40:14.044 --> 00:40:16.347 line:95%,end
Oh, here.
So she-- is she's not coming?

00:40:16.414 --> 00:40:18.582 line:95%,end
Oh, you slide right into her spot.

00:40:18.649 --> 00:40:19.683 line:95%,end
ABBY: No, just giving you
a little more room.

00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:21.318 line:95%,end
For god's sakes, Jill.

00:40:21.385 --> 00:40:24.054 line:95%,end
I was just surprised,
because yesterday Melissa says

00:40:24.121 --> 00:40:25.890 line:95%,end
she was fine
and it wasn't that bad, so I was just--

00:40:25.956 --> 00:40:27.992 line:95%,end
She wanted her to do
the group dance, remember?

00:40:28.058 --> 00:40:29.994 line:95%,end
Exactly. So she's okay, she can do it.

00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:31.429 line:95%,end
HOLLY (VOICEOVER): I didn't see anything.

00:40:31.495 --> 00:40:33.964 line:5%,start
Nothing looked usual during rehearsal.

00:40:34.031 --> 00:40:35.266 line:5%,start
Everything looked fine.

00:40:35.332 --> 00:40:38.602 line:95%,end
I didn't notice any injury
or Mackenzie getting hurt.

00:40:39.904 --> 00:40:41.572 line:95%,end
KELLY: Oh, Melissa's calling me.

00:40:41.639 --> 00:40:42.773 line:95%,end
Hello?

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:44.408 line:95%,end
- MELISSA (ON PHONE): Hi.
- Hi.

00:40:46.944 --> 00:40:49.246 line:5%,start
Yeah. I thought she was okay.

00:40:54.151 --> 00:40:55.152 line:5%,start
Yeah.

00:41:00.391 --> 00:41:01.425 line:5%,start
Aw.

00:41:03.427 --> 00:41:04.428 line:5%,start
Yeah.

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:13.604 line:95%,end
Yeah, Paige didn't even cry,
and it was broken.

00:41:13.671 --> 00:41:14.672 line:95%,end
Yeah.

00:41:15.639 --> 00:41:17.842 line:95%,end
Alright. Well, tell her
we're thinking of her.

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:21.378 line:5%,start
And I'll just have her stay over.

00:41:21.445 --> 00:41:23.214 line:95%,end
- MELISSA (ON PHONE): Okay, thank you.
- Okay.

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:24.348 line:95%,end
- Okay.
- Alright.

00:41:24.415 --> 00:41:25.583 line:95%,end
Talk to you later. Bye.

00:41:30.688 --> 00:41:31.856 line:95%,end
ABBY: Shoulders down!

00:41:33.557 --> 00:41:36.260 line:95%,end
I thought Melissa liked the bridal shower.
Did you guys?

00:41:36.327 --> 00:41:38.128 line:95%,end
- I did too.
- Oh, I think she had a good time.

00:41:38.195 --> 00:41:39.296 line:95%,end
KELLY: I thought she had fun.

00:41:39.363 --> 00:41:41.799 line:95%,end
Well, everybody likes that--
like, that moment.

00:41:41.866 --> 00:41:43.300 line:95%,end
KELLY: Oh, yeah.

00:41:43.367 --> 00:41:46.270 line:95%,end
- You're like the star.
- CHRISTI: Queen bee, man.

00:41:46.337 --> 00:41:48.806 line:95%,end
Well, last year wasn't as much fun
because she didn't try on any dresses.

00:41:48.873 --> 00:41:52.443 line:95%,end
- I mean, I tried on dresses--
- She denied even being engaged last year.

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:56.347 line:95%,end
Why does she wear her wedding band
if she's not already married?

00:41:56.413 --> 00:41:58.649 line:95%,end
- I thought she was secretly married.
- KELLY: Who knows?

00:41:58.716 --> 00:42:00.885 line:95%,end
That's the secret
you're trying to get out of her?

00:42:00.951 --> 00:42:02.653 line:95%,end
You think she's married?

00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:06.557 line:5%,start
I probably am the one who knows the least
about Melissa's wedding details.

00:42:06.624 --> 00:42:07.858 line:95%,end
And I'd like to keep it that way,

00:42:07.925 --> 00:42:10.160 line:95%,end
because something says
that she would sue me first.

00:42:15.232 --> 00:42:19.336 line:95%,end
You need to make sure that you get still--

00:42:19.403 --> 00:42:21.972 line:95%,end
there's still a reaction there.
It's like turn, turn, turn, drop!

00:42:22.039 --> 00:42:25.242 line:95%,end
It's never turn, turn,
turn, up, fly, drop.

00:42:27.177 --> 00:42:28.579 line:95%,end
Up! Yes.

00:42:28.646 --> 00:42:30.748 line:95%,end
Thank you. Okay?
Have you heard from your mother?

00:42:34.351 --> 00:42:36.387 line:95%,end
Alright. Don't worry about your sister.

00:42:36.453 --> 00:42:38.222 line:95%,end
It's not life or death. It's her foot.

00:42:39.256 --> 00:42:40.558 line:95%,end
Worry about your feet.

00:42:40.624 --> 00:42:43.427 line:95%,end
Alright, get the group in here
and get the boots on. Let's go.

00:42:43.494 --> 00:42:45.829 line:95%,end
Do you think Kenzie
can compete this weekend?

00:42:45.896 --> 00:42:47.398 line:95%,end
What if she comes back with a boot?

00:42:47.464 --> 00:42:48.599 line:95%,end
Paige still had to do
a hip hop dance with a--

00:42:48.666 --> 00:42:50.868 line:95%,end
Yes, you can still do hop with a boot on.

00:42:50.935 --> 00:42:52.269 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Remember?
KELLY: Paige is living proof.

00:42:52.336 --> 00:42:54.104 line:95%,end
I forgot about that. TouchÃ©.

00:42:54.171 --> 00:42:56.540 line:95%,end
Well, the thing is with
this hip hop dance,

00:42:56.607 --> 00:42:59.843 line:95%,end
you have to be able to move
really quickly and with confidence.

00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:01.679 line:95%,end
Yeah. And she's got combat boots on.


00:43:01.745 --> 00:43:04.014 line:95%,end
I'm not sure I recommend it
whether it's broken or not.

00:43:04.081 --> 00:43:05.182 line:95%,end
- Absolutely.
- Give it a rest.

00:43:05.249 --> 00:43:08.018 line:95%,end
Hey, but that's why
we wore combat boots in ours,

00:43:08.085 --> 00:43:12.022 line:95%,end
because Paige had the black boot on
and it blended in.

00:43:12.923 --> 00:43:13.924 line:95%,end
ABBY: Hello.

00:43:14.925 --> 00:43:16.460 line:95%,end
Okay, let's go, let's go.

00:43:17.261 --> 00:43:19.930 line:5%,start
ABBY (VOICEOVER): This is the last day
of rehearsal before competition.

00:43:19.997 --> 00:43:23.467 line:95%,end
I need to get my girls
ready to travel to Minnesota

00:43:23.534 --> 00:43:27.671 line:5%,start
and go up against some of the best studios
in the entire country.

00:43:28.973 --> 00:43:31.308 line:95%,end
More facials! Come on, Nia!

00:43:32.376 --> 00:43:34.078 line:95%,end
ABBY (VOICEOVER):
We're doing a hip hop number.

00:43:34.144 --> 00:43:36.947 line:95%,end
And that is well out of our comfort zone.

00:43:37.014 --> 00:43:40.751 line:95%,end
So I need these girls
to rise to the occasion and win.

00:43:40.818 --> 00:43:43.354 line:95%,end
ABBY: I just want to go over
the storyline here.

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:46.190 line:95%,end
You're my soldiers.

00:43:47.124 --> 00:43:50.694 line:95%,end
And it's called "Don't Ask, Just Tell."

00:43:50.761 --> 00:43:54.131 line:95%,end
And that's from the old slogan,
Don't Ask, Don't Tell.

00:43:54.198 --> 00:43:57.301 line:95%,end
I really don't know
how to explain something like that.

00:43:58.235 --> 00:43:59.837 line:95%,end
I don't think
I really have a frame of reference.

00:43:59.903 --> 00:44:01.805 line:95%,end
I don't think the kids
really give a [bleep]

00:44:01.872 --> 00:44:03.407 line:95%,end
what the name of their dance is called.

00:44:03.474 --> 00:44:04.742 line:95%,end
They just want to dance.

00:44:04.808 --> 00:44:06.076 line:95%,end
Sometimes I think
with the dances that they're doing--

00:44:06.143 --> 00:44:08.212 line:95%,end
KELLY: I don't think the kids even care.

00:44:08.278 --> 00:44:10.247 line:95%,end
--it helps to understand the characters
in the dance, to really connect to that.

00:44:10.314 --> 00:44:11.615 line:95%,end
I don't think this is a character, though.

00:44:11.682 --> 00:44:14.051 line:95%,end
HOLLY: But I was going to say,
but this dance, I don't think

00:44:14.118 --> 00:44:15.152 line:95%,end
that makes a difference.

00:44:15.219 --> 00:44:16.387 line:95%,end
Gay military.

00:44:16.453 --> 00:44:18.989 line:95%,end
So, girls. Don't Ask, Don't Tell.

00:44:19.056 --> 00:44:21.625 line:95%,end
Did anybody go home and talk to their mom
about what that means?

00:44:21.692 --> 00:44:22.693 line:95%,end
No?

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:24.828 line:95%,end
Alright, I'm going to get
your moms down here.

00:44:24.895 --> 00:44:27.398 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Somewhere,
God is looking down going,

00:44:27.464 --> 00:44:30.267 line:95%,end
I made the right choice
by not letting that woman be a mother.

00:44:31.001 --> 00:44:33.137 line:95%,end
- All of us downstairs?
- CHRISTI: I'm bringing my stuff.

00:44:33.203 --> 00:44:35.072 line:95%,end
- HOLLY: Okay, I'm bringing my purse too.
- CHRISTI: We can head out.

00:44:35.139 --> 00:44:37.641 line:95%,end
ABBY (VOICEOVER): When I talk to the kids
about the title of the routine,

00:44:37.708 --> 00:44:40.544 line:95%,end
I just see blank faces staring back at me.

00:44:40.611 --> 00:44:43.080 line:95%,end
They have no idea what I'm talking about.

00:44:43.147 --> 00:44:45.149 line:95%,end
And it's not my place to tell them.

00:44:45.215 --> 00:44:48.252 line:95%,end
So I call the moms down,
because I want them

00:44:48.318 --> 00:44:51.955 line:95%,end
to have a heart-to-heart with their kids
and discuss some of the stuff.

00:44:52.022 --> 00:44:54.525 line:95%,end
We live in a world
where you should be free

00:44:54.591 --> 00:44:56.627 line:95%,end
to love anybody you want.

00:44:56.694 --> 00:44:58.662 line:95%,end
But just like the pyramid,

00:44:58.729 --> 00:45:00.898 line:95%,end
I'm just missing the girls, not the moms.

00:45:00.964 --> 00:45:03.400 line:95%,end
- Go ahead and go.
- GIRLS: Thank you.

00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:07.571 line:95%,end
This is the age.

00:45:07.638 --> 00:45:09.940 line:95%,end
They are better to be well-educated,

00:45:12.142 --> 00:45:15.512 line:95%,end
and confident and comfortable
talking about things.

00:45:15.579 --> 00:45:18.515 line:95%,end
That's for you to discuss at home,
in your house.

00:45:19.416 --> 00:45:23.287 line:95%,end
And I hope that
you are respectful and open-minded.

00:45:23.353 --> 00:45:28.125 line:95%,end
This is very much alive in the arts.

00:45:28.192 --> 00:45:30.327 line:95%,end
- Mia loved working with Shangela.
- Yes.

00:45:30.394 --> 00:45:32.096 line:95%,end
HOLLY: I mean, that's as good
as it gets, you know.

00:45:32.162 --> 00:45:33.697 line:95%,end
ABBY: Shangela is fabulous.

00:45:33.764 --> 00:45:37.234 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Absolutely. Nia didn't know that
Shangela was a man for the longest time.

00:45:37.301 --> 00:45:39.870 line:95%,end
SHANGELA: Well, hi everyone.

00:45:39.937 --> 00:45:42.005 line:95%,end
My name is Shangela.

00:45:42.072 --> 00:45:43.540 line:95%,end
Did you explain what that is?

00:45:43.607 --> 00:45:45.976 line:95%,end
We had to. I had to tell-- absolutely.

00:45:46.043 --> 00:45:47.644 line:95%,end
And-- but I think--

00:45:47.711 --> 00:45:49.813 line:95%,end
That was a great opportunity,
thanks to you, to have that conversation.

00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:52.049 line:95%,end
We explained it to the children,
and I explained it to Kelly.

00:45:52.883 --> 00:45:56.787 line:95%,end
Abby keeps talking about acceptance
and how we all need to be accepting.

00:45:56.854 --> 00:45:59.389 line:95%,end
Well, I think Abby is
the least accepting person,

00:45:59.456 --> 00:46:01.792 line:95%,end
so maybe you ought to lead by example, Ab.

00:46:01.859 --> 00:46:03.727 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Is that what the dance is about,

00:46:03.794 --> 00:46:06.263 line:95%,end
is having a voice,
and having strength and power?

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:07.731 line:95%,end
- ABBY: Right.
- I was-- I just--

00:46:07.798 --> 00:46:10.167 line:95%,end
Don't keep it a secret
because secrets are lies.

00:46:11.435 --> 00:46:16.240 line:95%,end
Tell the world,
and you'll feel that sense of freedom.

00:46:16.306 --> 00:46:19.376 line:95%,end
So that's not the conversation
I want to have with your daughters.

00:46:19.443 --> 00:46:21.311 line:95%,end
I have enough trouble
getting their legs straight

00:46:21.378 --> 00:46:23.113 line:95%,end
and stretching their feet.

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:25.783 line:95%,end
That's a conversation that
you all have to have with your daughters.

00:46:31.155 --> 00:46:32.556 line:95%,end
Look at this.

00:46:33.557 --> 00:46:34.858 line:95%,end
I'm going to wear this one.

00:46:34.925 --> 00:46:37.628 line:95%,end
And on the other hand, this is yours.

00:46:37.694 --> 00:46:38.996 line:95%,end
PAIGE: No.

00:46:39.062 --> 00:46:40.497 line:95%,end
KELLY: What are you guys doing?

00:46:40.564 --> 00:46:42.933 line:95%,end
- We're just looking at costumes.
- Yeah.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.469 line:95%,end
So do you know what this dance means?


00:46:45.536 --> 00:46:46.904 line:95%,end
- Not really.
- Kind of.

00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:50.207 line:95%,end
Well, it's talking about gay people, okay?

00:46:50.274 --> 00:46:52.943 line:95%,end
And you guys,
especially being in the dance world,

00:46:53.010 --> 00:46:55.546 line:95%,end
there's a lot of boys that dance
that are gay.

00:46:55.612 --> 00:46:58.682 line:95%,end
And you never want
to treat them differently.

00:46:58.749 --> 00:47:01.652 line:95%,end
I mean, you can't help
who you fall in love with.

00:47:01.718 --> 00:47:05.255 line:95%,end
So do you realize
what the Don't Ask, Don't Tell is?

00:47:05.322 --> 00:47:08.258 line:95%,end
It's like if you're in the military
and somebody asks you,

00:47:08.325 --> 00:47:12.062 line:95%,end
you're not supposed to say
whether you are or you aren't.

00:47:12.863 --> 00:47:16.033 line:95%,end
What if you couldn't express
how much you love dance?

00:47:16.099 --> 00:47:17.501 line:95%,end
Wouldn't that make you feel bad?

00:47:18.368 --> 00:47:21.939 line:95%,end
So, like, that's why
everybody should be able to express

00:47:22.005 --> 00:47:24.441 line:95%,end
how they feel about anything or anyone.

00:47:24.508 --> 00:47:27.077 line:95%,end
I just want you guys to grow up knowing

00:47:27.144 --> 00:47:30.848 line:95%,end
it's everybody's choice
to love who you want to love.

00:47:31.715 --> 00:47:34.017 line:95%,end
So you guys understand
what this routine's about?

00:47:34.084 --> 00:47:35.619 line:95%,end
- Yes.
- KELLY: Yeah?

00:47:35.686 --> 00:47:38.388 line:95%,end
Are you guys okay with people being gay?

00:47:38.455 --> 00:47:41.692 line:95%,end
A lot of gay people that I've met
are a lot funnier.

00:47:41.758 --> 00:47:43.460 line:95%,end
- Yeah.
- And a lot more attractive.

00:47:43.527 --> 00:47:45.229 line:95%,end
I think some of the best people
in the world

00:47:45.295 --> 00:47:46.430 line:95%,end
to be friends with are gay people.

00:47:46.496 --> 00:47:47.631 line:95%,end
Sure.

00:47:47.698 --> 00:47:51.301 line:95%,end
And any time you guys want
to talk about who you like,

00:47:51.368 --> 00:47:53.103 line:95%,end
you can always talk to mommy.

00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:54.571 line:95%,end
- And daddy.
- Alright.

00:47:54.638 --> 00:47:55.672 line:95%,end
I'm going to be late for class.

00:48:04.514 --> 00:48:05.949 line:95%,end
KELLY: Okay, Miss Maddie.

00:48:09.286 --> 00:48:10.988 line:5%,start
Wonder how Kenzie is.

00:48:11.054 --> 00:48:13.023 line:95%,end
Earlier, Melissa took Mackenzie
to the hospital

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:16.293 line:95%,end
to get her foot checked out,
so I have to drop Maddie off at home.

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:18.695 line:95%,end
And plus, I want to go in
and see how Mackenzie's foot is.

00:48:18.762 --> 00:48:20.664 line:95%,end
KELLY: I have a peanut for you!

00:48:20.731 --> 00:48:22.266 line:95%,end
- Hi.
- Hello.

00:48:22.332 --> 00:48:23.533 line:95%,end
- Hi, Mad.
- Hi.

00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:25.435 line:95%,end
- How is she?
- Oh.

00:48:25.502 --> 00:48:26.870 line:95%,end
Oh, my goodness!

00:48:27.571 --> 00:48:31.508 line:95%,end
They said-- they took X-rays,
and it's not broken or anything.

00:48:31.575 --> 00:48:32.976 line:95%,end
She sprained it.

00:48:33.043 --> 00:48:35.312 line:95%,end
They said 72 hours no dance.

00:48:35.379 --> 00:48:37.981 line:95%,end
Ugh. Sometimes a sprain
is worse than a break.

00:48:38.048 --> 00:48:40.117 line:95%,end
I know. That's what everybody says to me.

00:48:40.183 --> 00:48:41.385 line:95%,end
Oh, my goodness.

00:48:41.451 --> 00:48:44.321 line:95%,end
MELISSA: So she has to just
keep it elevated whenever she can.

00:48:44.388 --> 00:48:46.089 line:95%,end
And we have to ice it.

00:48:46.156 --> 00:48:48.191 line:95%,end
- You know that drill.
- KELLY: Yeah.

00:48:48.926 --> 00:48:49.960 line:95%,end
Did you tell Abby?

00:48:50.961 --> 00:48:52.095 line:95%,end
Did we tell Abby yet?

00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:54.731 line:95%,end
No, we haven't told Abby yet.

00:48:54.798 --> 00:48:56.366 line:95%,end
MELISSA (VOICEOVER):
I'm very brokenhearted for Mackenzie

00:48:56.433 --> 00:48:58.635 line:95%,end
because she always loves
to be in the group dance.

00:48:58.702 --> 00:49:01.972 line:95%,end
And when she can hang
with the girls, you know,

00:49:02.706 --> 00:49:04.274 line:95%,end
it just makes it-- I don't know.

00:49:04.341 --> 00:49:06.810 line:95%,end
I just want her to be happy,
and I'm so sad that she's not.

00:49:06.877 --> 00:49:08.278 line:95%,end
Thanks for bringing Mad home.

00:49:08.345 --> 00:49:09.780 line:95%,end
- Oh you're welcome.
- MELISSA: We beat you.

00:49:09.846 --> 00:49:10.847 line:95%,end
I know!

00:49:10.914 --> 00:49:12.382 line:95%,end
- MELISSA: I was at the hospital.
- We couldn't get out of there!

00:49:13.350 --> 00:49:14.351 line:95%,end
MELISSA: We went in and out.

00:49:14.418 --> 00:49:16.620 line:95%,end
KELLY (VOICEOVER): I just don't know
what to think about Mackenzie's foot.

00:49:16.687 --> 00:49:18.755 line:95%,end
I mean, two days ago,
she was jumping around

00:49:18.822 --> 00:49:20.490 line:95%,end
the dance studio like a jumping bean.

00:49:20.557 --> 00:49:22.326 line:95%,end
And now she can't dance for three days,

00:49:22.392 --> 00:49:23.961 line:95%,end
and it's right before the competition.

00:49:24.027 --> 00:49:26.363 line:95%,end
So, Kenz, what do you think
about not being able to dance?

00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:28.231 line:95%,end
Sad.

00:49:28.298 --> 00:49:30.033 line:95%,end
- Sad.
- KELLY: You're sad?

00:49:31.234 --> 00:49:33.270 line:95%,end
Yeah, you're not going to know
what to do with yourself, huh?

00:49:33.337 --> 00:49:34.404 line:95%,end
You're always dancing.

00:49:34.471 --> 00:49:37.774 line:95%,end
MELISSA:
Mackenzie loves this dance so much.

00:49:37.841 --> 00:49:39.343 line:95%,end
It was really hard for her at first.

00:49:40.310 --> 00:49:42.646 line:95%,end
But once she caught on,
she really loved it.

00:49:43.513 --> 00:49:44.915 line:95%,end
- She likes hip hop.
- KELLY: Yeah.

00:49:44.982 --> 00:49:47.050 line:95%,end
- Our other--
- My kids hate hip hop.

00:49:47.117 --> 00:49:50.187 line:95%,end
Mine probably wish they had
the ace bandage on their foot

Watch her do her dance, for god's sakes.

01:00:31.361 --> 01:00:32.795 line:95%,end
KELLY (VOICEOVER):
If you want Brooke to be a leader

01:00:32.862 --> 01:00:34.364 line:95%,end
and you want her to act like she cares,

01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:35.999 line:95%,end
then maybe you should act like you care.


01:00:43.973 --> 01:00:45.875 line:5%,start
Wasn't it nice for Abby to come in?

01:00:45.942 --> 01:00:48.311 line:95%,end
But she left and didn't run Brooke's solo.

01:00:49.646 --> 01:00:50.680 line:95%,end
I don't know.

01:00:51.447 --> 01:00:55.418 line:95%,end
It would be nice if her dance teacher
was a cheerleader for her, maybe.

01:00:56.819 --> 01:00:57.820 line:95%,end
Just saying.

01:00:57.887 --> 01:00:59.856 line:5%,start
Abby wants Brooke to care about dance.

01:00:59.922 --> 01:01:01.424 line:5%,start
But how is she supposed to care about it

01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:03.526 line:5%,start
when her dance teacher
doesn't even give a [bleep] about her?

01:01:04.394 --> 01:01:06.663 line:95%,end
(WHISPERING) Abby wants her
to, like, want it so much.

01:01:07.563 --> 01:01:10.600 line:95%,end
But how can she want it
when her teacher doesn't want it for her?

01:01:12.702 --> 01:01:15.171 line:95%,end
She sat here this entire time,
doing it by herself.

01:01:15.238 --> 01:01:17.907 line:95%,end
She didn't look at her costume.
She didn't tell her how to wear her hair.

01:01:17.974 --> 01:01:18.975 line:95%,end
She didn't tell her nothing.

01:01:19.842 --> 01:01:20.910 line:95%,end
But she did that one.

01:01:23.312 --> 01:01:25.281 line:95%,end
Watch her do her dance, for god's sakes.

01:01:25.348 --> 01:01:27.083 line:95%,end
KELLY (VOICEOVER):
If Brooke doesn't do well on this solo,

01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:28.451 line:95%,end
I'm blaming it all on Abby.

01:01:28.518 --> 01:01:30.853 line:95%,end
I don't know how
Abby expects her to do well

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:32.555 line:95%,end
when she doesn't pay any attention to her.

01:01:32.622 --> 01:01:34.824 line:95%,end
JILL: You know what, guys, I have to use
the restroom real quick. Excuse me.

01:01:39.762 --> 01:01:42.598 line:95%,end
So, what kinds of secrets and lies
do you think that one's keeping?

01:01:42.665 --> 01:01:44.901 line:95%,end
Someone here has a secret, apparently.

01:01:45.935 --> 01:01:49.005 line:95%,end
JILL: Abby, hold up. I want to show you
something I had done for Kendall.

01:01:49.072 --> 01:01:51.407 line:95%,end
- I had some new headshots taken.
- Okay.

01:01:51.474 --> 01:01:55.044 line:95%,end
- Because--
- Whoo! That's beautiful!

01:01:55.111 --> 01:01:57.513 line:95%,end
See, that's what I think of Kendall
when I look at her.

01:01:57.580 --> 01:01:59.048 line:95%,end
She's a gorgeous child.

01:01:59.115 --> 01:02:02.752 line:95%,end
I'd love to take advantage of that now,
while she's young.

01:02:02.819 --> 01:02:05.621 line:95%,end
For the pyramid or the studio,
I love that.

01:02:05.688 --> 01:02:07.023 line:95%,end
I think it's gorgeous.

01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:09.125 line:95%,end
- Can we use one of these for the pyramid?
- Oh, yes.

01:02:09.192 --> 01:02:10.493 line:95%,end
JILL: Let's do a new pyramid shot.

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:12.161 line:95%,end
ABBY (VOICEOVER):
Jill wants her kid on top,

01:02:12.228 --> 01:02:15.198 line:5%,start
and she'll do anything to get her there.

01:02:15.264 --> 01:02:17.533 line:5%,start
Be careful what you wish for, Jill.

01:02:20.203 --> 01:02:21.437 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Melissa.

01:02:21.504 --> 01:02:25.608 line:95%,end
Mackenzie was running around here
doing cartwheels.

01:02:25.675 --> 01:02:28.177 line:95%,end
She was using her wheelchair as a prop.

01:02:28.244 --> 01:02:29.345 line:95%,end
I was yelling at her all day.

01:02:30.246 --> 01:02:32.548 line:95%,end
You said earlier in the week
Mackenzie thought the dance was too hard.

01:02:33.349 --> 01:02:36.119 line:95%,end
Mackenzie loved this dance, Christi.
She told me she was--

01:02:36.185 --> 01:02:39.956 line:95%,end
she cried when she got home
because she loved this dance so much.

01:02:40.022 --> 01:02:41.624 line:95%,end
She's hurt. She's not lying.

01:02:41.691 --> 01:02:43.993 line:95%,end
My child is not lying. I promise you.

01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:46.729 line:5%,start
Earlier today,
when Abby wasn't in the room,

01:02:46.796 --> 01:02:48.798 line:5%,start
we saw Mackenzie doing cartwheels.

01:02:48.865 --> 01:02:50.700 line:95%,end
I think she just doesn't want
to be in the group dance,

01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:52.101 line:95%,end
and Melissa's covering for her.

01:02:52.168 --> 01:02:54.303 line:95%,end
KELLY: And you have to see
our point that we're saying.

01:02:54.370 --> 01:02:56.105 line:95%,end
I do, but my daughter is hurt.

01:02:56.172 --> 01:02:58.775 line:95%,end
She was completely running
around here that entire time.

01:02:58.841 --> 01:03:01.310 line:95%,end
No, the doctor did not say
for her not to walk.

01:03:01.377 --> 01:03:03.179 line:95%,end
Not to dance for 72 hours.

01:03:05.715 --> 01:03:07.383 line:95%,end
She's not supposed to walk on her foot.

01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:09.118 line:95%,end
She probably shouldn't
be doing cartwheels either.

01:03:09.185 --> 01:03:12.822 line:95%,end
My god! I didn't make her do it!
For [bleep] sake.

01:03:15.424 --> 01:03:17.326 line:95%,end
I don't want you to think
I'm picking on Mackenzie.

01:03:17.393 --> 01:03:18.528 line:95%,end
Whatever.

01:03:19.929 --> 01:03:21.731 line:95%,end
I already told you.
I don't need to explain.

01:03:23.432 --> 01:03:26.435 line:95%,end
[music playing]

ANNOUNCER: Alright, moving ahead
just a little bit in your program

01:03:32.742 --> 01:03:36.646 line:95%,end

with "Arm Yourself."

[MUSIC - AUDREY RYAN, "ARM YOURSELF"]

01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:07.677 line:95%,end
Arm yourself


01:04:09.212 --> 01:04:15.818 line:95%,end
for the life that you intend.

01:04:18.721 --> 01:04:25.628 line:95%,end
'Cause it's never easy

01:04:27.797 --> 01:04:34.804 line:95%,end
to get what you want.

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:38.507 line:95%,end
Good job.

01:04:59.896 --> 01:05:06.903 line:95%,end
Arm yourself

01:05:08.471 --> 01:05:15.478 line:95%,end
for the life that you intend.

01:05:18.147 --> 01:05:24.253 line:95%,end
And I need you.

01:05:26.923 --> 01:05:33.362 line:95%,end
Would you rather be see-it-through?

01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:41.771 line:95%,end
[applause]

01:05:46.108 --> 01:05:47.777 line:95%,end
KELLY (VOICEOVER): I think Brooke
did really well in her dance,

01:05:47.843 --> 01:05:50.613 line:95%,end
considering she didn't have
a dance teacher run it with her.

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:53.182 line:95%,end
I think that if Abby would have been
in the dressing room

01:05:53.249 --> 01:05:55.885 line:95%,end
and ran the solo with her,
Brooke wouldn't have forgot a step.

01:05:55.952 --> 01:05:57.753 line:95%,end
I thought Brooke did really good.

01:05:57.820 --> 01:05:59.555 line:95%,end
HOLLY: I thought she looked beautiful.

01:05:59.622 --> 01:06:02.525 line:95%,end
I know one thing.
I don't want to hear one thing from Abby.

01:06:02.591 --> 01:06:03.826 line:95%,end
- Why?
- Like, one correction.

01:06:03.893 --> 01:06:05.661 line:95%,end
Because she wasn't in here
to run her dance with her!

01:06:05.728 --> 01:06:07.563 line:95%,end
You know what?
If you can't give her the corrections

01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:09.598 line:95%,end
before she goes on stage,
then don't give her any.

01:06:09.665 --> 01:06:12.868 line:95%,end
She spent no time with her.
She never looked at her costume once.

01:06:12.935 --> 01:06:16.138 line:95%,end
She never looked at her makeup.
She never told her how to wear her hair.

01:06:16.205 --> 01:06:18.808 line:95%,end
Nothing. Never watched her do a thing.

01:06:18.874 --> 01:06:21.510 line:95%,end
She did it on her own.
And I'm proud of her.

01:06:23.212 --> 01:06:25.014 line:95%,end
[cheering]

01:06:25.081 --> 01:06:26.682 line:95%,end
You were amazing.

01:06:26.749 --> 01:06:28.351 line:95%,end

01:06:28.417 --> 01:06:31.487 line:95%,end
- I loved it.
- JILL: Beautiful, girlfriend.

01:06:31.554 --> 01:06:33.255 line:95%,end
I don't think you could
have done it any better.

01:06:34.423 --> 01:06:36.726 line:95%,end
And you know what? You had no help.

01:06:36.792 --> 01:06:38.728 line:95%,end
Does that bother you,
that Abby doesn't help you?

01:06:40.596 --> 01:06:41.998 line:95%,end
No matter how you score?

01:06:42.064 --> 01:06:43.566 line:95%,end
I was proud of you.

01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:45.768 line:95%,end
Thank you.

01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:49.638 line:95%,end
I think Brooke showed a lot of maturity
by doing this all on her own.

01:06:49.705 --> 01:06:51.674 line:95%,end
She did it without a dance teacher.

01:06:55.011 --> 01:06:57.213 line:95%,end
Alright, Brooke. Nice job.

01:06:57.279 --> 01:06:58.814 line:95%,end
- Thank you.
- How did it feel?

01:07:00.016 --> 01:07:01.417 line:95%,end
- Pretty good.
- ABBY: Pretty good?

01:07:02.418 --> 01:07:04.487 line:95%,end
So do you think it could have been better?

01:07:05.421 --> 01:07:06.422 line:95%,end
You do?

01:07:07.490 --> 01:07:08.991 line:95%,end
Then why didn't you do your best?

01:07:09.859 --> 01:07:14.196 line:95%,end
Well, I got stuck on my one turn,
like on the floor, like--

01:07:14.263 --> 01:07:15.831 line:95%,end
On the arabesque? Yes.

01:07:15.898 --> 01:07:17.800 line:95%,end
ABBY (VOICEOVER):
Brooke did well with her solo,

01:07:17.867 --> 01:07:20.636 line:95%,end
but I think she could have done
a whole lot better.

01:07:20.703 --> 01:07:24.140 line:95%,end
If Brooke would realize that
she was put on this Earth to dance,

01:07:24.206 --> 01:07:25.608 line:95%,end
maybe she would work harder.

01:07:25.674 --> 01:07:27.109 line:95%,end
Maybe she would be more passionate.

01:07:29.578 --> 01:07:31.414 line:95%,end
What's the matter?
Why are you sitting there sulking?

01:07:32.615 --> 01:07:33.716 line:95%,end
Maybe if her dance teacher was in here,

01:07:33.783 --> 01:07:35.618 line:95%,end
running it with her
before she went out on stage--

01:07:35.684 --> 01:07:36.986 line:95%,end
- She did it. It was great.
- KELLY: --she would have remember.


01:07:37.053 --> 01:07:38.054 line:95%,end
I said it was great.

01:07:39.055 --> 01:07:40.623 line:95%,end
Brooke, if you keep running it
and running it and running it,

01:07:40.689 --> 01:07:42.124 line:95%,end
your back's gonna hurt.

01:07:42.191 --> 01:07:44.994 line:95%,end
You're the major here,
or the colonel, or whatever it is.

01:07:45.061 --> 01:07:49.165 line:95%,end
You need to be the seniority,
up the ladder.

01:07:49.231 --> 01:07:51.233 line:95%,end
She isn't treated with seniority.

01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:54.236 line:95%,end
I treat her like 14-year-old.

01:07:54.303 --> 01:07:56.572 line:95%,end
I have a bunch of 14-year-olds at home,
ready to do their dances,

01:07:56.639 --> 01:07:57.973 line:95%,end
and nobody's there running it with them.

01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:01.610 line:95%,end
Yeah, and you haven't run hers with her
for the last two week-- or last two solos.

01:08:01.677 --> 01:08:03.279 line:95%,end
I expect you to remember.

01:08:03.345 --> 01:08:04.747 line:95%,end
It's a two-minute solo.

01:08:04.814 --> 01:08:06.615 line:95%,end
You need to remember it.

01:08:06.682 --> 01:08:08.951 line:95%,end
ABBY (VOICEOVER): Brooke Is 14 years old.

01:08:09.018 --> 01:08:10.986 line:95%,end
It's time for her to be independent.

01:08:11.053 --> 01:08:14.090 line:95%,end
If she was in an audition,
would she have her dance teacher there

01:08:14.156 --> 01:08:16.859 line:95%,end
to run the numbers with her
10 minutes before she goes on?

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:17.927 line:95%,end
Uh, no.

01:08:17.993 --> 01:08:19.895 line:95%,end
Brooke, it's time to grow up.

01:08:19.962 --> 01:08:21.931 line:95%,end
ABBY: What about you, Mackenzie?
How's the foot?

01:08:21.997 --> 01:08:23.799 line:95%,end
She just told me it felt a little better.

01:08:23.866 --> 01:08:25.134 line:95%,end
It did feel a little better?

01:08:25.201 --> 01:08:26.936 line:95%,end
She's resting a little bit. But it's--

01:08:27.002 --> 01:08:28.838 line:95%,end
ABBY: You're resting?
What are you resting from?

01:08:28.904 --> 01:08:29.905 line:5%,start
All the cartwheels you were doing?

01:08:31.841 --> 01:08:35.077 line:5%,start
ABBY (VOICEOVER): Come on.
My eyes and ears are everywhere.

01:08:35.144 --> 01:08:38.380 line:95%,end
Did Mackenzie really think that
she was gonna do cartwheels

01:08:38.447 --> 01:08:39.882 line:95%,end
and I wouldn't know about it?

01:08:39.949 --> 01:08:42.017 line:95%,end
Mackenzie, if you're faking that injury,

01:08:42.084 --> 01:08:44.453 line:95%,end
there's going to be huge repercussions.

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:46.522 line:95%,end
- She was hopping.
- KELLY: Oh, Melissa.

01:08:46.589 --> 01:08:48.023 line:95%,end
MELISSA: She was! I was watching her, Kel.

01:08:48.090 --> 01:08:49.925 line:95%,end
Melissa, don't lie for your kids.

01:08:49.992 --> 01:08:52.228 line:95%,end
- MELISSA: I'm not. I watched her!
- ABBY: You lie enough yourself as it is--

01:08:52.294 --> 01:08:53.662 line:95%,end
- What do you mean?
- ABBY: --without lying for her.

01:08:53.729 --> 01:08:54.897 line:95%,end
I was watching her!

01:08:54.964 --> 01:08:57.366 line:95%,end
CHRISTI (VOICEOVER): I think
Melissa is covering for Mackenzie.

01:08:57.433 --> 01:09:00.469 line:95%,end
They both need to just fess up and get
their punishment over with already.

01:09:00.536 --> 01:09:02.571 line:95%,end
I told her to sit down a hundred times.

01:09:02.638 --> 01:09:04.673 line:95%,end
She said, I'm not on my foot, Mom.

01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:06.642 line:95%,end
ABBY: Melissa, did your mom and dad

01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:08.844 line:95%,end
take a hundred times
to tell you the same thing?

01:09:08.911 --> 01:09:11.914 line:95%,end
- Never.
- But you're letting her run you!

01:09:13.516 --> 01:09:15.484 line:95%,end
Well, if you can do cartwheels,
and you can do this,

01:09:15.551 --> 01:09:18.020 line:95%,end

[applause]

KELLY (VOICEOVER):
This is the second week in a row

01:17:56.238 --> 01:17:58.407 line:95%,end
that she got second place for her solo.

01:17:59.441 --> 01:18:01.009 line:95%,end
I think Brooke did really well,

01:18:01.076 --> 01:18:04.212 line:5%,start
considering Abby was not there
when Brooke needed her.

01:18:04.279 --> 01:18:08.650 line:95%,end

01:18:54.029 --> 01:18:56.164 line:5%,start
MELISSA (VOICEOVER): Maddie learned
this dance three days ago

01:18:56.231 --> 01:18:57.866 line:5%,start
and came in second place

01:18:57.933 --> 01:19:01.036 line:5%,start
to a girl that has probably
learned her solo months ago.

01:19:01.103 --> 01:19:04.773 line:5%,start
ANNOUNCER: We're going to be
acknowledging our top 10 highest scoring
routines.

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:08.944 line:95%,end
Starting off in 10th place
is act number 78, "Mad World."


01:19:11.613 --> 01:19:14.916 line:95%,end
In ninth place, is act number 72,
"Bring on the Men."

In seventh place,
with a score of 274.2 points,

01:19:26.661 --> 01:19:29.564 line:5%,start
is act number 84, "Don't Ask, Just Tell."

01:19:31.767 --> 01:19:32.968 line:5%,start
Who was that?

01:19:33.969 --> 01:19:35.403 line:95%,end
KELLY (VOICEOVER): We finished in seventh.

01:19:35.470 --> 01:19:37.239 line:95%,end
And I thought that was pretty good

01:19:37.305 --> 01:19:39.207 line:95%,end
because I didn't think
we would be in the top 10.

01:19:39.274 --> 01:19:40.942 line:95%,end
Very well done. Seventh place.

01:19:41.009 --> 01:19:42.110 line:95%,end
The Abby Lee Dance Company.

01:19:42.177 --> 01:19:44.012 line:95%,end
Congratulations. Sixth place.

01:19:44.079 --> 01:19:46.014 line:95%,end
MELISSA (VOICEOVER):
Abby's probably not going to be happy

01:19:46.081 --> 01:19:48.450 line:95%,end
about seventh place for this group dance.

01:19:48.517 --> 01:19:50.752 line:95%,end
I don't know what
she's going to make them do.

01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:52.888 line:95%,end
Maybe boot camp again this week.

01:19:52.954 --> 01:19:55.090 line:95%,end
No, I don't want it.
I got to look back here.

01:19:55.157 --> 01:19:56.191 line:95%,end
KELLY: Oh, my god.
I have bullets everywhere.

01:19:56.258 --> 01:19:58.160 line:95%,end
JILL: Oh, the kids are still--
I'm like, where are their costumes?

01:19:58.226 --> 01:19:59.561 line:95%,end
KELLY: Just keeping the ones
that I have left over.

01:19:59.628 --> 01:20:00.929 line:95%,end
Good job, girls.

01:20:00.996 --> 01:20:02.130 line:95%,end
Hey, you did hip hop!

01:20:02.197 --> 01:20:03.865 line:95%,end
- It's amazing.
- Honey, I'm proud of you.

01:20:03.932 --> 01:20:05.834 line:95%,end
- What's that face for?
- I'm just happy.

01:20:05.901 --> 01:20:08.770 line:95%,end
JILL: I'm really proud of you.
You should be really proud of yourself.

01:20:12.541 --> 01:20:14.676 line:95%,end
Oh, she surrendered.

01:20:17.212 --> 01:20:18.914 line:95%,end
It's not funny. I'm surrendering.

01:20:20.215 --> 01:20:21.383 line:95%,end
Yeah.

01:20:21.449 --> 01:20:23.552 line:5%,start
I'm waving the white flag
because I surrender.

01:20:23.618 --> 01:20:24.686 line:5%,start
I give up.

01:20:24.753 --> 01:20:28.824 line:5%,start
I am sick and tired of fighting
with these miserable women

01:20:28.890 --> 01:20:31.226 line:95%,end
to get their kids to the next level.

01:20:31.293 --> 01:20:33.228 line:95%,end
- What place?
- GIRLS: Seventh.

01:20:33.295 --> 01:20:34.296 line:95%,end
Seventh?

01:20:35.664 --> 01:20:37.265 line:95%,end
Maddie? Second?

01:20:37.332 --> 01:20:38.934 line:95%,end
I thought you were great.
I thought you were wonderful.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.203 line:95%,end
I thought the kid was sloppy and a mess.

01:20:41.269 --> 01:20:45.207 line:95%,end
Kendall, outstanding
being in fourth overall.

01:20:45.273 --> 01:20:47.108 line:95%,end
Maddie, she's chomping at your heels.

01:20:48.143 --> 01:20:49.444 line:95%,end
Figure out if you want more.

01:20:50.612 --> 01:20:51.980 line:95%,end
And what about you?

01:20:53.081 --> 01:20:54.316 line:95%,end
Second place?

01:20:54.382 --> 01:20:57.219 line:95%,end
Just think,
if you worked this much harder.

01:20:57.986 --> 01:20:59.354 line:95%,end
Chloe, I thought you looked good.

01:20:59.421 --> 01:21:02.224 line:95%,end
You just take your head and spot down
to the ground from time to time.

01:21:02.290 --> 01:21:05.093 line:95%,end
- And you will work on that.
- Yes.

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:08.230 line:95%,end
ABBY: You guys should have
turned around in that line

01:21:08.296 --> 01:21:10.332 line:95%,end
and attacked those judges.

01:21:10.398 --> 01:21:12.500 line:95%,end
CHRISTI (VOICEOVER): Personally,
I don't know what Abby's so upset about.

01:21:12.567 --> 01:21:17.339 line:95%,end
I mean, it's a hip hop number,
and hip hop is not exactly our forte.

01:21:17.405 --> 01:21:19.140 line:5%,start
So little piece of advice, Abby.

01:21:19.207 --> 01:21:20.809 line:5%,start
If you want the girls to win,

01:21:20.876 --> 01:21:24.512 line:95%,end
how about giving them choreography
and a routine that they're good at?

01:21:25.213 --> 01:21:27.849 line:95%,end
Soldiers, you are discharged. Go. Out!

01:21:27.916 --> 01:21:29.517 line:95%,end
I don't want to see you.

01:21:31.853 --> 01:21:34.389 line:95%,end
Remember at the pyramid
how I sent the girls out

01:21:34.456 --> 01:21:35.790 line:95%,end
because I wanted to talk to all of you?

01:21:35.857 --> 01:21:37.826 line:95%,end
You don't like me yelling at your kids?

01:21:37.893 --> 01:21:41.196 line:95%,end
There was not one thing that I said
that they didn't need to hear.

01:21:41.263 --> 01:21:43.498 line:95%,end
Melissa, that kid should have won.

01:21:43.565 --> 01:21:45.000 line:95%,end
She should have been 10 points above.

01:21:45.734 --> 01:21:48.670 line:95%,end
You need to sit down with that kid,

01:21:48.737 --> 01:21:51.640 line:95%,end
and you need to figure out
what we're doing.

01:21:51.706 --> 01:21:54.576 line:95%,end
Because she could have just won
that whole entire thing.

01:21:54.643 --> 01:21:57.279 line:95%,end
She is throwing her talent away.

01:21:57.345 --> 01:22:02.517 line:95%,end
And if she's in pain,
and she physically cannot do it, Kelly,

01:22:03.585 --> 01:22:06.922 line:95%,end
it's time to not be dancing anymore.

01:22:06.988 --> 01:22:08.690 line:95%,end
ABBY (VOICEOVER):
Seventh overall high score?

01:22:08.757 --> 01:22:10.959 line:95%,end
That doesn't sound like
an overall high score to me.

01:22:11.026 --> 01:22:13.328 line:95%,end
We went from second
all the way down to seventh.

01:22:13.395 --> 01:22:14.529 line:95%,end
That's abysmal.

01:22:14.596 --> 01:22:17.465 line:95%,end
There is something broken in the ALDC,

01:22:17.532 --> 01:22:19.601 line:95%,end
and I need to fix it and fix it quick.

01:22:21.503 --> 01:22:23.738 line:95%,end
ABBY: I will see you Monday.
And I'll tell you what.

01:22:23.805 --> 01:22:28.743 line:95%,end
The kids need to be in class,
ready to go at 5:30.

01:22:34.349 --> 01:22:35.750 line:5%,start
ABBY (VOICEOVER): Next on "Dance Moms."

01:22:35.817 --> 01:22:38.586 line:5%,start
The group routine is about Rosa Parks.

01:22:38.653 --> 01:22:41.423 line:5%,start
Mackenzie, do you know
what being benched is?

01:22:41.489 --> 01:22:44.225 line:5%,start
I'm the only one who gets in trouble
for wanting something for my child.

01:22:44.292 --> 01:22:46.161 line:5%,start
Well, because none of us do crazy stuff.

01:22:46.227 --> 01:22:47.896 line:5%,start
ABBY: Do something with that face!

01:22:47.963 --> 01:22:50.832 line:5%,start
What's the status with Rosa Parks?

01:22:51.466 --> 01:22:53.635 line:5%,start
We won last time. Remember that.

01:22:53.702 --> 01:22:54.736 line:5%,start
- They need men in their life.
- Hey!

01:22:54.803 --> 01:22:56.237 line:5%,start
- They need men.
- Do you like affection?

01:22:56.304 --> 01:22:58.673 line:5%,start
Who said they saw Cathy with a bodyguard?

01:22:58.740 --> 01:23:00.275 line:5%,start
Maybe if we throw a stick, she'll leave.

01:23:00.342 --> 01:23:02.610 line:5%,start
I'm not the one
that fell down the ugly tree

01:23:02.677 --> 01:23:04.346 line:5%,start
and got hit by every branch.
