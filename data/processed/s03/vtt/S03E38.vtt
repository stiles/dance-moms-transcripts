Coming up on "Dance Moms Reunion"
live performances--

00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:06.006 line:5%,start
Yes!

00:00:06.072 --> 00:00:07.107 line:5%,start
JEFF COLLINS (VOICEOVER):
--moms are gonna hash it out--

00:00:07.173 --> 00:00:08.475 line:5%,start
Christi, you're not the victim.

00:00:08.541 --> 00:00:11.311 line:5%,start
You're the one who had
the bruise from punching me.

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:13.780 line:5%,start
You still think I'm 12. I'm 42.

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:15.181 line:5%,start
I'm paying you for a service.

00:00:15.248 --> 00:00:16.249 line:5%,start
KRISTIE: Asia's won--
- She did.

00:00:16.316 --> 00:00:17.884 line:5%,start
KRISTIE: --seven times for
Abby, so get that straight

00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:19.219 line:5%,start
before you talk.
- Woo!

00:00:19.285 --> 00:00:20.687 line:5%,start
JEFF COLLINS (VOICEOVER):
And Abby has a big surprise.

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:23.790 line:5%,start
You owe an apology
to that child, okay?

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:25.225 line:5%,start
- 'Cause if you want to call it--
ABBY: Okay. Get off stage.

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:26.426 line:5%,start
JEFF: No, no, no.
- Now wait a minute.

00:00:26.493 --> 00:00:27.694 line:5%,start
JEFF: No, no, no.
- She can sit there--

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:28.828 line:5%,start
KELLY: --and say I should
be committed as a wacko--

00:00:28.895 --> 00:00:30.697 line:5%,start
Thank you, 'cause
I'm going to dinner.

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:36.469 line:95%,end
Get on the floor.

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:41.307 line:5%,start
My world is with my girls,
living on the dance floor.

[cheers and applause]

Welcome to season 3's
"Dance Moms Reunion Show."

00:00:52.952 --> 00:00:54.821 line:5%,start
We like to call this
one "Hurricane Abby."

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:56.423 line:5%,start
[applause]

00:00:57.557 --> 00:00:59.759 line:95%,end
I'm the executive producer of
"Dance Moms," Jeff Collins.

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:02.362 line:95%,end
And we've got the eye of the
storm herself right here--

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:04.264 line:95%,end
Miss Abby Lee Miller,
star of our show.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.532 line:95%,end
- Hello.
JEFF: How are you?

00:01:05.598 --> 00:01:06.833 line:95%,end
I'm good, thank you.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.268 line:95%,end
JEFF: Well, as we've
all seen, this season

00:01:08.334 --> 00:01:11.371 line:95%,end
ended with a category 3 storm
that left viewers wondering

00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:13.773 line:95%,end
which moms will survive and
which ones are gonna be washed

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.109 line:95%,end
ashore, never to be
heard from again.

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:19.646 line:95%,end
Plus, we're gonna show you some shocking
footage that has never aired.

00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:21.214 line:95%,end
So let's dive right
in and take a look

00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:25.151 line:95%,end
at this clip that sets the stage for what
really happened in New Orleans.

00:01:25.218 --> 00:01:26.586 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:28.588 line:5%,start
Better grab Christi.
She's going nuts.

00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:29.856 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: Sorry.

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:31.825 line:95%,end
I'm a real Dance Mom,
and I will stand here.

00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:32.926 line:95%,end
Why are you yelling at us?

00:01:32.992 --> 00:01:33.993 line:95%,end
- I'm not.
- You're doing it.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.528 line:95%,end
- I'm talking to my friend.
- And you're yelling at her.

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:37.063 line:95%,end
- Hush!
- You had too much to drink.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.164 line:95%,end
Oh, whatever.

00:01:38.231 --> 00:01:39.632 line:95%,end
- You've gotta settle it down. Bitch!
- [gasp]

00:01:39.699 --> 00:01:41.568 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:01:41.634 --> 00:01:43.703 line:95%,end
- Stop, stop. Stop!
- [bleep]

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.371 line:95%,end
- Bitch! [bleep] kick your ass.
- Stop.

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:46.739 line:95%,end
- Stop, stop.
CHRISTI: Ow!

00:01:46.806 --> 00:01:48.308 line:95%,end
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:49.375 line:95%,end
Just get--
MAN: Don't hit me.

00:01:49.442 --> 00:01:50.910 line:95%,end
- Oh, [bleep] you.
MAN: Leslie!

00:01:50.977 --> 00:01:52.445 line:95%,end
You bitch.

00:01:53.146 --> 00:01:57.150 line:95%,end
Well, as you can see,
accusations and hurricanes,

00:01:57.217 --> 00:02:00.053 line:95%,end
as in those big giant ones
that people drink, flew.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.888 line:95%,end
You weren't there.
You didn't see it.

00:02:01.988 --> 00:02:03.990 line:95%,end
You saw it just now.
What's your reaction?

00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:08.094 line:95%,end
Those two adults, who
should be grateful to me,

00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:12.098 line:95%,end
first and foremost, have not
only tarnished my reputation,

00:02:12.165 --> 00:02:15.869 line:95%,end
but they have succeeded in
destroying something

00:02:15.935 --> 00:02:18.071 line:95%,end
that it took me 30 years to build.

00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:19.739 line:95%,end
They are representing me.

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:22.375 line:95%,end
They acted like trash in the
middle of Bourbon Street,

00:02:22.442 --> 00:02:24.110 line:95%,end
and that's exactly
what they are.

00:02:24.177 --> 00:02:26.713 line:95%,end
All right. So Abby, let's bring
out Leslie and Christi

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:28.248 line:95%,end
and hear their
side of the story.

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:30.116 line:95%,end
Aren't you excited
to hear this tale?

00:02:30.183 --> 00:02:31.618 line:95%,end
No.

00:02:31.684 --> 00:02:32.886 line:95%,end
[laughter]

00:02:32.952 --> 00:02:34.454 line:95%,end
All right, so listen.
We had to separate them.

00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:37.023 line:95%,end
Leslie is the only mom
not in the green room.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.925 line:95%,end
Here seeing each other
for the very first time,

00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:40.793 line:95%,end
please welcome
Christi and Leslie.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.328 line:95%,end
[cheers and applause]
Come on out.

00:02:42.395 --> 00:02:43.763 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Hello, Jeff.
JEFF: Hello, ladies.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.198 line:95%,end
- Hi, Abby.
- How are you?

00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:46.699 line:95%,end
Have a seat.

00:02:46.766 --> 00:02:48.101 line:95%,end
Have a seat, Leslie.
- Hi, Jeff.

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:49.369 line:95%,end
Hi, Abby.
- It's good to see you.

00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:51.371 line:95%,end
All right. So, Leslie and Christi,
we really want

00:02:51.437 --> 00:02:53.373 line:95%,end
to hear your side of the
story about what happened.

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:54.541 line:95%,end
Tell us what went wrong.

00:02:54.607 --> 00:02:55.875 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: You know,
I don't really know.

00:02:55.942 --> 00:02:57.644 line:95%,end
We were having fun
and it just got ugly.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.246 line:95%,end
And I said the next day when
we came back to the studio,

00:03:00.313 --> 00:03:01.681 line:95%,end
I shouldn't have done that.

00:03:01.748 --> 00:03:03.383 line:95%,end
I said, I wish it hadn't
gotten to that point.

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:06.452 line:95%,end
And I felt bad about it.

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.721 line:95%,end
It was an ugly thing.
I was wrong at the beginning.

00:03:08.788 --> 00:03:09.822 line:95%,end
I know I was.

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:11.724 line:95%,end
And the police came.

00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:13.426 line:95%,end
And they wanted me
to do certain things.

00:03:13.493 --> 00:03:14.494 line:95%,end
And I said, you know what?

00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:16.863 line:95%,end
This isn't what I want
to do, and I went home.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.166 line:95%,end
And I'm willing to take the
ownership that I behaved

00:03:20.233 --> 00:03:21.367 line:95%,end
incorrectly, you know.

00:03:21.434 --> 00:03:22.735 line:95%,end
But that's just me.

00:03:22.802 --> 00:03:25.205 line:95%,end
So, Leslie, what do you think?
What's your side of the story?


00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:27.006 line:95%,end
Well, you're very predictable.

00:03:27.073 --> 00:03:28.641 line:95%,end
You just sat there and told
that whole story to Jeff

00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:30.777 line:95%,end
and you'd never even
looked my way to apologize.

00:03:30.843 --> 00:03:32.212 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I did look at you.
You weren't looking at me.

00:03:32.278 --> 00:03:34.247 line:95%,end
You were looking down.
- You're always the victim.

00:03:34.314 --> 00:03:35.348 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: No, I didn't--

00:03:35.415 --> 00:03:36.816 line:95%,end
I just took
responsibility, Leslie.

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:38.451 line:95%,end
But I need to
tell you my side of it.

00:03:38.518 --> 00:03:40.286 line:95%,end
So can you give me a
minute and let me speak?

00:03:40.353 --> 00:03:42.388 line:95%,end
Yeah. Nobody ever stops
you from speaking.

00:03:42.455 --> 00:03:43.756 line:95%,end
I walked away
from you many of times

00:03:43.823 --> 00:03:45.158 line:95%,end
and tried to get
out of your path.

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:48.228 line:95%,end
And out of nowhere,
you just go into this craze,

00:03:48.294 --> 00:03:49.395 line:95%,end
and you did this.

00:03:49.462 --> 00:03:52.165 line:95%,end
So this has to come deeper
within than just me saying,

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:53.800 line:95%,end
why are you yelling at us?

00:03:53.866 --> 00:03:54.968 line:95%,end
We didn't do anything wrong.
- No--

00:03:55.034 --> 00:03:56.803 line:95%,end
LESLIE: It has to go a lot
deeper than that, Christi.

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:59.939 line:95%,end
Okay, but let's make
something very clear, Leslie.

00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:02.875 line:95%,end
You have been involved in assaults
in the past, where I have not.

00:04:02.942 --> 00:04:04.544 line:95%,end
LESLIE: You're gonna keep
bringing that up when I--

00:04:04.611 --> 00:04:06.079 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I am.
LESLIE: There you go again.

00:04:06.145 --> 00:04:07.480 line:95%,end
You're the victim and
we're all ganging up on you.

00:04:07.547 --> 00:04:08.548 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I know.

00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:10.250 line:95%,end
- Christi, you're not the victim.
- Neither are you, Leslie.

00:04:10.316 --> 00:04:13.653 line:95%,end
Because you're the one who had
the bruise from punching me.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.756 line:95%,end
What were you thinking
right before you assaulted me?

00:04:16.823 --> 00:04:18.224 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I was talking to my friend.
- What was going through your head?

00:04:18.291 --> 00:04:19.792 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I did not assault you.

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.027 line:95%,end
I threw a drink.

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:22.829 line:95%,end
LESLIE: Well, if you look at the law--
- I hit the bottom of your cup.

00:04:22.895 --> 00:04:24.330 line:95%,end
--throwing
alcohol in somebody's eyes

00:04:24.397 --> 00:04:25.932 line:95%,end
is just like punching
them with your fist.

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:27.267 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Okay.
- It's that much of a--

00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:28.334 line:95%,end
All right.
LESLIE: Okay.

00:04:28.401 --> 00:04:30.069 line:95%,end
I didn't realize
that you were a judge.

00:04:30.136 --> 00:04:31.371 line:95%,end
I had no idea.
- I'm not a judge.

00:04:31.437 --> 00:04:33.273 line:95%,end
I'm a dance mom.
CHRISTI: Okay.

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:35.074 line:95%,end
Can you please--
let's just put it all out

00:04:35.141 --> 00:04:36.643 line:95%,end
on this table right
here in front of you.

00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:39.045 line:95%,end
What-- why am I a threat to you?
- You're not a threat to me.

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:40.113 line:95%,end
That's not it.
LESLIE: I'm not a threat to you.

00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:41.414 line:95%,end
My daughter's not a
threat to your daughter.

00:04:41.481 --> 00:04:42.482 line:95%,end
You're not.

00:04:42.548 --> 00:04:43.950 line:95%,end
I've been on this
Earth longer than you,

00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:45.351 line:95%,end
and I've been fighting
for my two girls

00:04:45.418 --> 00:04:47.720 line:95%,end
to get into this industry
a lot longer than you have.

00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:49.055 line:95%,end
- Okay.
LESLIE: Don't forget that.

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:50.490 line:95%,end
And I--
- Who cares?

00:04:50.556 --> 00:04:51.724 line:95%,end
LESLIE: And guess what?
The a difference between you and I

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:54.460 line:95%,end
is, I don't step on people's
backs, I don't burn my bridges,

00:04:54.527 --> 00:04:57.864 line:95%,end
and I don't ever treat people
the wrong way, like you do.

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.465 line:95%,end
Okay.

00:04:59.532 --> 00:05:01.000 line:95%,end
JEFF: What do you have
to say about this, Abby?

00:05:01.067 --> 00:05:02.568 line:95%,end
Well, the Abby
Lee Dance Company

00:05:02.635 --> 00:05:06.172 line:95%,end
has a contract for
situations like this.

00:05:06.239 --> 00:05:09.342 line:95%,end
However, I decided that I
had to put my foot down--

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:13.446 line:95%,end
that I could no longer
look the other way

00:05:13.513 --> 00:05:15.114 line:95%,end
for the sake of the win.

00:05:15.181 --> 00:05:19.085 line:95%,end
That going to Nationals
with a number--

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:26.125 line:95%,end
that didn't matter as much as
my contract and my reputation

00:05:26.192 --> 00:05:28.227 line:95%,end
and putting my foot
down for the future.

00:05:28.294 --> 00:05:30.563 line:95%,end
You know, when people go and
they represent the Abby Lee

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.700 line:95%,end
Dance Company, you're not
representing you and her.

00:05:33.766 --> 00:05:37.070 line:95%,end
They are representing everybody
that came before them.

00:05:37.136 --> 00:05:39.672 line:95%,end
So I looked at the dance,
I looked at the kids, and I said,

00:05:39.739 --> 00:05:41.507 line:95%,end
you know what?
They have to go.

00:05:41.574 --> 00:05:45.244 line:95%,end
Immediately, Leslie
was remorseful.

00:05:45.311 --> 00:05:49.849 line:95%,end
She was humbled by the
situation that she took part in.

00:05:49.916 --> 00:05:51.084 line:95%,end
She apologized.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.319 line:95%,end
She apologized to
me and to the group.

00:05:53.386 --> 00:05:58.191 line:95%,end
And Christi has yet to apologize
to me or to the dance company.

00:05:59.592 --> 00:06:03.129 line:95%,end
And frankly, you owe
an apology to Chloe.

00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:04.597 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Just so I can
state for the record--

00:06:04.664 --> 00:06:06.432 line:95%,end
ABBY: You owe an
apology to that child.

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:08.368 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: You haven't--
you owe her apology,

00:06:08.434 --> 00:06:10.436 line:95%,end
because she had
nothing to do with it.

00:06:10.503 --> 00:06:12.705 line:95%,end
JEFF: Listen, the New Orleans
Police Department was called

00:06:12.772 --> 00:06:14.741 line:95%,end
and some ladies were
sent home packing.

00:06:14.807 --> 00:06:17.343 line:95%,end
So here's what happened next,
including some footage you've

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.445 line:95%,end
never seen before today.
So let's take a look at this.

00:06:20.413 --> 00:06:22.048 line:5%,start
- What am I?
- You're a bitch.

00:06:22.115 --> 00:06:23.683 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: I'm a mother who's
trying to protect her daughter.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.084 line:95%,end
What are you?
LESLIE: Look at you.

00:06:25.151 --> 00:06:26.719 line:95%,end
Look what you're doing.

00:06:26.786 --> 00:06:28.020 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Okay.
You know what?

00:06:28.087 --> 00:06:29.422 line:95%,end
I am calling the police--
LESLIE: You'd better go home.

00:06:29.489 --> 00:06:30.890 line:95%,end
- --because she hit me.
- You'd better go home!

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.058 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Oh, I'm calling
the police, baby--

00:06:32.125 --> 00:06:33.359 line:95%,end
You'd better go home--
better go home.

00:06:33.426 --> 00:06:34.527 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: --because you hit me.

00:06:34.594 --> 00:06:35.728 line:95%,end
I'm just warning you,
you'd better go home.

00:06:35.828 --> 00:06:37.563 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Oh, I'm
calling the cops.

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.365 line:95%,end
Calling the cops, Leslie.

00:06:39.432 --> 00:06:41.300 line:95%,end
They'd better
pull me off of you.

00:06:41.367 --> 00:06:42.902 line:95%,end
You're acting like
a [bleep] out here.

00:06:43.002 --> 00:06:46.973 line:95%,end
Yes, I'd like to report an
assault in Jackson Square.

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:49.942 line:95%,end
Another adult struck me and
I'd like to report an assault.


00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:52.512 line:95%,end
Can I have a cop here please?

00:06:52.578 --> 00:06:55.248 line:95%,end
All right. So looking back on that,
do you think calling the police

00:06:55.314 --> 00:06:56.949 line:95%,end
was a little bit too far?

00:06:57.016 --> 00:06:59.285 line:95%,end
Yeah, of course. I mean, and that's why
I didn't go through.

00:06:59.352 --> 00:07:01.621 line:95%,end
Like, I walked, I talked to them.
I didn't do anything.

00:07:01.687 --> 00:07:04.490 line:95%,end
And you can believe
what you want,

00:07:04.557 --> 00:07:05.892 line:95%,end
but Kelly was in there with me.

00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.794 line:95%,end
And I explained the
entire situation to them.

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.062 line:95%,end
You called the police. They probably
laughed at you and said--

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:11.597 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Uh, no.
Actually--

00:07:11.664 --> 00:07:13.733 line:95%,end
--why are you calling us when
you assaulted this woman first?

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.935 line:95%,end
No. The police actually wanted me
to take a restraining order out on you--

00:07:16.002 --> 00:07:17.403 line:95%,end
LESLIE: They probably laughed.
They wanted to?

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:19.005 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: --because you
threatened to kill me.

00:07:19.071 --> 00:07:22.108 line:95%,end
LESLIE: You know what?
The truth is, you were wrong.

00:07:22.175 --> 00:07:23.843 line:95%,end
- I said I was wrong.
- You were wrong to call the police.

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:25.411 line:95%,end
And you know what?

00:07:25.478 --> 00:07:27.180 line:95%,end
Except you won't take any
ownership for your behavior.

00:07:27.246 --> 00:07:28.514 line:95%,end
Leslie, let me
ask you a question.

00:07:28.581 --> 00:07:30.616 line:95%,end
What's been the
toughest part for you

00:07:30.683 --> 00:07:31.751 line:95%,end
of dealing with the Dance Moms?

00:07:31.818 --> 00:07:32.952 line:95%,end
Like especially Christi.

00:07:33.052 --> 00:07:35.421 line:95%,end
The toughest part is
that a group of them

00:07:35.488 --> 00:07:39.091 line:95%,end
can still stick together
and back each other up

00:07:39.158 --> 00:07:41.194 line:95%,end
when it's just not the right thing.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.697 line:95%,end
I am not out to get anybody or
hate anybody or treat anybody

00:07:44.764 --> 00:07:46.799 line:95%,end
different, just because
their child is good,

00:07:46.866 --> 00:07:48.100 line:95%,end
or get some opportunity.

00:07:48.167 --> 00:07:51.204 line:95%,end
Because that's why
we're all there.

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:54.106 line:95%,end
We wouldn't all be there
if that wasn't the case.

00:07:54.173 --> 00:07:55.541 line:95%,end
And you're not
gonna run me out--

00:07:55.608 --> 00:07:56.809 line:95%,end
I don't want to run you out.

00:07:56.876 --> 00:07:57.944 line:95%,end
LESLIE: --just like you
ran every other mother--

00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:59.145 line:95%,end
I don't care
that you're there.

00:07:59.212 --> 00:08:00.513 line:95%,end
LESLIE: --who has
brought their child

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:01.747 line:95%,end
there for the same
opportunities that you have.

00:08:01.814 --> 00:08:03.049 line:95%,end
You've run everybody
out, including myself.

00:08:03.115 --> 00:08:04.450 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: No, I haven't.

00:08:04.517 --> 00:08:05.585 line:95%,end
Christi, what's your
biggest issue with Leslie?

00:08:05.651 --> 00:08:06.719 line:95%,end
What is your biggest
overall issue with her?

00:08:06.786 --> 00:08:08.154 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: You know what?

00:08:08.221 --> 00:08:09.555 line:95%,end
My biggest issue with
Leslie is just the fact--

00:08:09.622 --> 00:08:11.491 line:95%,end
like, she's very aggressive.

00:08:11.591 --> 00:08:13.826 line:95%,end
Everything is very in your face.

00:08:13.926 --> 00:08:16.496 line:95%,end
And like, nobody gets to
have an opinion- two cents.

00:08:16.562 --> 00:08:17.897 line:95%,end
They never get to say anything.

00:08:17.964 --> 00:08:20.233 line:95%,end
She's right and she just keeps
at you and at you and at you.

00:08:20.299 --> 00:08:22.735 line:95%,end
And like, it's frustrating.
It's frustrating.

00:08:22.802 --> 00:08:24.370 line:95%,end
You get all of the
other moms out here

00:08:24.437 --> 00:08:26.005 line:95%,end
and every single one
of them will tell you

00:08:26.072 --> 00:08:27.473 line:95%,end
the exact same thing.
- [sighs]

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:28.741 line:95%,end
JEFF: Let's switch gears
here for a little bit.

00:08:28.808 --> 00:08:30.209 line:95%,end

the perfect follow up

it out to two dancers,

whole Christi and Leslie

JEFF: Why?

00:10:38.337 --> 00:10:40.206 line:95%,end
KRISTIE: When you
go into a studio,

after I saw what I saw,
and I see Christi there

00:10:42.742 --> 00:10:44.810 line:95%,end
and no Leslie, I have
a problem with that.

00:10:44.877 --> 00:10:46.012 line:95%,end
There's two people involved.

Two people should be gone.

When I'm sticking up for
Leslie because she's not there,

all the mothers had
a different story.

CHRISTI: That's not my fault
that I was sitting there

00:10:55.054 --> 00:10:56.489 line:95%,end
and the other mothers
had a different opinion.

00:10:56.589 --> 00:10:57.823 line:95%,end
That's my point.
CHRISTI: But then--

00:10:57.890 --> 00:10:59.158 line:95%,end
You should have said
right at that point--

00:10:59.258 --> 00:11:01.260 line:95%,end
- They're afraid to stand up against you.
CHRISTI: No, no.

KRISTIE: You know, when we're
out and you're not around,

I'm not one--

It's manipulative.

really funny is, she talks

who's made it a mission to destroy

00:11:27.053 --> 00:11:29.155 line:95%,end
Let's watch a clip that may give
us some better understanding

00:11:29.221 --> 00:11:30.589 line:95%,end
to Kristie Ray's motives.

00:11:30.656 --> 00:11:32.024 line:5%,start
[music playing]

00:11:32.091 --> 00:11:33.392 line:5%,start
KRISTIE: Let's not
count it, coat it,

00:11:33.459 --> 00:11:34.794 line:5%,start
and let's tell what
really happened--

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:36.462 line:95%,end
that this is [bleep].

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:38.097 line:95%,end
You know it is, okay?

00:11:38.164 --> 00:11:39.699 line:95%,end
And Leslie's not here
to defend herself.

00:11:39.765 --> 00:11:40.766 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: This has
nothing to do with you.

00:11:40.833 --> 00:11:42.201 line:95%,end
KRISTIE: No, but I'm
pissed off when people

00:11:42.301 --> 00:11:45.337 line:95%,end
try to tell a different story when
someone's not here to defend themselves.

00:11:45.404 --> 00:11:47.673 line:95%,end
And this story right here
is not how it happened.

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.375 line:95%,end
You got in her face first.

00:11:49.442 --> 00:11:51.510 line:95%,end
You can say all you
want with words.

00:11:51.577 --> 00:11:54.146 line:95%,end
But when you directly start it,

00:11:54.213 --> 00:11:56.148 line:95%,end
you'd better be able to
back up your [bleep]

00:11:56.215 --> 00:11:57.750 line:95%,end
She called me a drunk!

00:11:57.817 --> 00:11:58.918 line:95%,end
Control yourself.

00:11:58.984 --> 00:12:00.686 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: All right.
Well, you--

00:12:00.753 --> 00:12:01.854 line:95%,end
KRISTIE: Control yourself.
- You have spoken.

00:12:01.921 --> 00:12:03.255 line:95%,end
KRISTIE: You know what?

00:12:03.322 --> 00:12:05.224 line:95%,end
I'm not playing this stupid
game that you guys like

00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:06.292 line:95%,end
to play with the manipulation.

00:12:06.358 --> 00:12:07.793 line:95%,end
You need to settle
yourself down.

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:09.895 line:95%,end
KRISTIE: No, I don't,
because I hate [bleep] liars.

00:12:09.995 --> 00:12:11.630 line:95%,end
MELISSA: We don't like to curse.
- Really?

00:12:11.697 --> 00:12:13.265 line:95%,end
You guys all do
except Holly, so don't

00:12:13.332 --> 00:12:15.234 line:95%,end
start acting like you're on this
high roll that you don't curse.

00:12:15.301 --> 00:12:16.769 line:95%,end
JILL: No, we really don't.

00:12:16.836 --> 00:12:18.971 line:95%,end
She's a liar, and you guys
are all backing up the lie.

00:12:19.839 --> 00:12:21.640 line:95%,end
So, Leslie, when you
see that-- you know,

00:12:21.707 --> 00:12:23.476 line:95%,end
Kristie Ray standing up for
you-- what do you think?

00:12:23.542 --> 00:12:24.744 line:95%,end
I appreciate her.

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:26.178 line:95%,end
I appreciate that you
were there to defend me.

00:12:26.245 --> 00:12:27.813 line:95%,end
I wasn't there to
be able to do it,

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.182 line:95%,end
and someone got
my side out there.

00:12:30.249 --> 00:12:31.784 line:95%,end
And you know what?

00:12:31.851 --> 00:12:33.652 line:95%,end
Even though that happened,
you still never reached out

00:12:33.719 --> 00:12:35.755 line:95%,end
to apologize to me. So it just shows what
kind of person you really are.

00:12:35.855 --> 00:12:37.056 line:95%,end
And Leslie, it goes both ways.

00:12:37.123 --> 00:12:38.657 line:95%,end
I do not owe you an apology.

00:12:38.724 --> 00:12:40.059 line:95%,end
Okay.

00:12:40.126 --> 00:12:41.160 line:95%,end
JEFF: So with
moods and alliances

00:12:41.227 --> 00:12:42.928 line:95%,end
changing at a moment's notice,
I guess

00:12:42.995 --> 00:12:45.064 line:95%,end
we'll have to wait till the next season
to see who will

00:12:45.131 --> 00:12:46.999 line:95%,end
and who will not still
be a part of this group.

00:12:47.066 --> 00:12:49.502 line:95%,end
Needless to say,
the Twitter verse and the blogs

00:12:49.568 --> 00:12:51.570 line:95%,end
were ablaze whenever Abby
and Kelly were at odds.

00:12:51.637 --> 00:12:54.106 line:5%,start
- Good luck, babe.
- [exhales] Thanks. I need it.

00:12:54.173 --> 00:12:55.674 line:5%,start
JEFF: Let's get her out here
and hear her side of the story.

00:12:55.741 --> 00:12:57.109 line:95%,end
It's the mom Abby has
known the longest.

00:12:57.176 --> 00:12:58.878 line:95%,end
Please welcome
Kelly to the stage.

00:12:58.944 --> 00:13:00.746 line:95%,end
[cheers and applause]

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:11.257 line:95%,end
So Kelly, you've been more defiant
than we've ever seen you before.

00:13:11.323 --> 00:13:15.561 line:95%,end
You seem to be more than willing
to be combative with Abby--

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:16.929 line:95%,end
to confront Abby.

00:13:16.996 --> 00:13:19.465 line:95%,end
What's going on with this
new-found confidence?

00:13:19.532 --> 00:13:21.066 line:95%,end
KELLY: I've made up my mind.

00:13:21.133 --> 00:13:23.035 line:95%,end
I'm not putting up with what
I've been putting up with.

00:13:23.102 --> 00:13:24.737 line:95%,end
I don't want to fight with Abby.

00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:26.138 line:95%,end
If my kids have
something that they

00:13:26.205 --> 00:13:29.642 line:95%,end
need to do to get ahead in this
business, they're gonna do it.

00:13:29.708 --> 00:13:31.043 line:95%,end
JEFF: Give me an
example of that.

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:32.945 line:95%,end
Are there things in particular
that you're pursuing

00:13:33.012 --> 00:13:34.213 line:95%,end
that she's not happy about?

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.515 line:95%,end
KELLY: I have Brooke
doing a music career.

00:13:36.582 --> 00:13:38.217 line:95%,end
I want Paige to do modeling.

00:13:38.284 --> 00:13:40.419 line:95%,end
I'm focusing on my children.

00:13:40.486 --> 00:13:43.823 line:95%,end
And you know, sometimes my kids
have to miss dance class to go

00:13:43.889 --> 00:13:45.191 line:95%,end
and do these other things.

00:13:45.257 --> 00:13:46.892 line:95%,end
And if that's what
it takes, then that's


00:13:46.959 --> 00:13:48.360 line:95%,end
what I'm going to do.

00:13:48.427 --> 00:13:51.263 line:95%,end
I think Kelly is
sounding a little naive.

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:54.366 line:95%,end
I just want my kids to be the
very best that they can be.

00:13:54.433 --> 00:13:55.901 line:95%,end
I don't want a one-hit wonder.

00:13:55.968 --> 00:13:59.605 line:95%,end
Brooke was an amazing
dancer and still could be.

00:13:59.672 --> 00:14:04.343 line:95%,end
So what I'm saying is,
don't let this be it.

00:14:04.443 --> 00:14:06.111 line:95%,end
Let this be just the beginning.

00:14:06.178 --> 00:14:07.713 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:14:09.148 --> 00:14:10.983 line:95%,end
JEFF: So Kelly caused an uproar
when she made a very critical

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:12.585 line:95%,end
decision, quitting the recital.

00:14:12.651 --> 00:14:14.386 line:95%,end
Let's take a look
at Kelly in action.

00:14:15.421 --> 00:14:16.522 line:95%,end
Or--

00:14:16.622 --> 00:14:18.023 line:95%,end
KELLY: I love how
you volunteered her.

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:21.560 line:95%,end
But you notice whenever you asked people,
nobody volunteered.

00:14:21.627 --> 00:14:22.995 line:95%,end
Or she did not volunteer.

00:14:23.062 --> 00:14:24.263 line:95%,end
You volunteered her.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:27.766 line:95%,end
When any one of these kids
were asked to do a new solo,

00:14:27.833 --> 00:14:29.034 line:95%,end
none of them chose to.

00:14:29.101 --> 00:14:30.836 line:95%,end
That's all I have to say.

00:14:30.903 --> 00:14:33.038 line:95%,end
Right, they didn't.
So let's do it again.

00:14:33.138 --> 00:14:34.540 line:95%,end
I'm gonna ask again,
and then you say, me.

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:35.875 line:95%,end
I'll do "Survivor."

00:14:35.975 --> 00:14:40.246 line:95%,end
Would anyone like to take
the place and do a solo?

00:14:40.312 --> 00:14:42.381 line:95%,end
Anybody?

00:14:42.448 --> 00:14:43.649 line:5%,start
Maddie, what?

00:14:48.287 --> 00:14:51.423 line:95%,end
KELLY: Never in 40 years of
being in the Abby Lee Dance

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:55.761 line:95%,end
Company has anyone been given
a solo the day of the [bleep]

00:14:55.828 --> 00:14:56.962 line:95%,end
recital, ever.
ABBY: You're out.

00:14:57.029 --> 00:14:58.063 line:95%,end
You're out.
KELLY: Go on.

00:14:58.130 --> 00:14:59.231 line:95%,end
Call the police.
Get her out of here.

00:14:59.331 --> 00:15:00.432 line:95%,end
KELLY: I'm done.
ABBY: Get her out of here.

00:15:00.499 --> 00:15:01.867 line:95%,end
Please, take me. Let's go.

00:15:01.934 --> 00:15:04.036 line:95%,end
ABBY: Get her out of this auditorium.
- Let's go. Let's go.

00:15:04.103 --> 00:15:05.237 line:95%,end
ABBY: You're finished.
You're out.

00:15:05.304 --> 00:15:06.305 line:95%,end
KELLY: Thank you.
- Goodbye.

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:10.075 line:95%,end
Every single dance
concert, you leave.

00:15:10.142 --> 00:15:13.379 line:95%,end
You're the one that always says that Paige
is always the weak link.

00:15:13.445 --> 00:15:16.682 line:95%,end
Why would you give the weak link
in the group the new solo

00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:17.917 line:95%,end
the day of the recital?

00:15:18.017 --> 00:15:20.152 line:95%,end
Why wouldn't you give
it to your star pupil?

00:15:20.219 --> 00:15:24.189 line:95%,end
Because the new solo was
gonna make Paige look great.

00:15:24.256 --> 00:15:25.257 line:95%,end
- Okay.
ABBY: It was adorable.

00:15:25.324 --> 00:15:26.825 line:95%,end
Okay, Abby.

00:15:26.892 --> 00:15:28.093 line:95%,end
ABBY: When I think of '40s
pinup girl, I think of Paige.

00:15:28.193 --> 00:15:29.295 line:95%,end
KELLY: Okay.
JEFF: All right.

00:15:29.361 --> 00:15:31.063 line:95%,end
Well, listen. Let's switch gears
just a little bit.

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:33.966 line:95%,end
This season, Kelly stood her ground
with Abby more than ever before--

00:15:34.033 --> 00:15:35.634 line:95%,end
sometimes to the extreme.

00:15:35.701 --> 00:15:37.937 line:95%,end
Here's a scene that will
help us understand this very

00:15:38.037 --> 00:15:39.238 line:95%,end
complicated relationship.

00:15:40.873 --> 00:15:42.241 line:5%,start
KELLY: I'm supposed to sit here.

00:15:42.308 --> 00:15:45.110 line:5%,start
You are no longer a member
of the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:15:46.679 --> 00:15:48.914 line:95%,end
I'm not moving.
Go around.

00:15:50.749 --> 00:15:52.117 line:95%,end
KELLY: I could
stand here all day.

00:15:52.184 --> 00:15:54.753 line:95%,end
ABBY: I'm sitting there having
this confrontation with Kelly,

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:56.088 line:95%,end
trying to ignore her.

00:15:56.155 --> 00:15:59.725 line:95%,end
And now this nincompoop is holding up
the entire competition.

00:15:59.792 --> 00:16:04.096 line:95%,end
She has the social graces
of an ant at a picnic.

00:16:04.163 --> 00:16:07.099 line:95%,end
You really want me to
climb over a seat in a dress?

00:16:07.566 --> 00:16:11.337 line:95%,end
I pay her for her service, and she doesn't
know this dance competition.

00:16:11.403 --> 00:16:13.539 line:95%,end
If I want to go there and
I want to support my team,

00:16:13.605 --> 00:16:14.707 line:95%,end
then I'm going.

00:16:14.773 --> 00:16:15.941 line:95%,end
I'm done taking her [bleep].

00:16:16.008 --> 00:16:17.776 line:95%,end
Right.
There's 1,000 seats in here.

00:16:17.843 --> 00:16:19.078 line:95%,end
Put your butt in one.

00:16:19.144 --> 00:16:21.547 line:95%,end
Not this one.

00:16:21.613 --> 00:16:23.282 line:95%,end
Let's go.

00:16:24.883 --> 00:16:27.553 line:95%,end
The producers tell me that
you stood there for 30 minutes.

00:16:27.619 --> 00:16:29.855 line:95%,end
- I did. Yep.
JEFF: It was like a standoff.

00:16:29.922 --> 00:16:31.991 line:95%,end
I'm just sitting there
and the entire judging panel

00:16:32.091 --> 00:16:36.161 line:95%,end
has turned to look
at me, including

00:16:36.228 --> 00:16:38.731 line:95%,end
the people in the wings are
now looking at me on stage.

00:16:38.797 --> 00:16:40.299 line:95%,end
We're in Orlando, Florida--

00:16:40.366 --> 00:16:43.002 line:95%,end
KELLY: Wondering why you wouldn't stand up
and let the person in.

00:16:43.102 --> 00:16:44.870 line:95%,end
That's what you do
in an auditorium.

00:16:44.937 --> 00:16:46.138 line:95%,end
You stand up--
- No, you arrive on time--

00:16:46.205 --> 00:16:48.507 line:95%,end
KELLY: --and let the other
person walk in and sit down.

00:16:48.574 --> 00:16:50.009 line:95%,end
And if you are
late upon arrival--

00:16:50.109 --> 00:16:51.343 line:95%,end
KELLY: No, you walk in--

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:52.745 line:95%,end
--you are seated when
there's an intermission.

00:16:52.811 --> 00:16:55.014 line:95%,end
KELLY: --after the music
stops and in between dances.

00:16:55.114 --> 00:16:57.449 line:95%,end
That's when you go in and sit
down, and that is what I did.

00:16:57.516 --> 00:16:58.684 line:95%,end
And who taught you
that, sweetheart?

00:16:58.751 --> 00:17:00.019 line:95%,end
You.
ABBY: Right.

00:17:00.085 --> 00:17:02.254 line:95%,end
So I walked in when
I was supposed to.

00:17:02.321 --> 00:17:04.089 line:95%,end
There's 1,000 seats
in the auditorium.

00:17:04.156 --> 00:17:06.358 line:95%,end
KELLY: Theater etiquette--
you still think I'm 12.

00:17:06.425 --> 00:17:07.693 line:95%,end
I'm 42.

00:17:07.793 --> 00:17:09.161 line:95%,end
I'm paying you for a service.

00:17:09.228 --> 00:17:10.896 line:95%,end
I'm not your dance
student any longer.

00:17:10.963 --> 00:17:12.264 line:95%,end
You are not
paying me on Sunday

00:17:12.331 --> 00:17:14.366 line:95%,end
to be in a dance competition,
or on a Saturday.

00:17:14.433 --> 00:17:15.534 line:95%,end
KELLY: Okay.
Well, you don't own the thing.

00:17:15.601 --> 00:17:17.503 line:95%,end
I was there for my children--
- No.

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:19.071 line:95%,end
- Right.
- --and my teammates.

So stick your butt in a
seat and shut your mouth.

[cheers and applause]

00:17:23.942 --> 00:17:25.010 line:95%,end
All right.
We're gonna switch gears again.

00:17:25.077 --> 00:17:27.346 line:95%,end
It's time for some more fun
with another performance.

00:17:27.413 --> 00:17:29.948 line:95%,end
This one has Maddie,
Chloe, Brooke, Paige, Nia,

[MUSIC - APRIL HIGUERA,
"ECHOES"]

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:38.524 line:5%,start
(SINGING) I hear
echoes inside myself.

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:41.760 line:95%,end
They're banging the
walls for help--

00:17:41.827 --> 00:17:48.200 line:95%,end
some kind of malady I can't
spell eating at my heart,

00:17:48.267 --> 00:17:53.705 line:95%,end
choking on the darkness
outside myself.

00:17:53.772 --> 00:17:57.042 line:95%,end
Can I embrace the moment?

00:17:57.109 --> 00:18:03.282 line:95%,end
I can't take another wasted day.

00:18:04.183 --> 00:18:10.355 line:95%,end
I know that I'm so close,
'cause I can taste it.

00:18:10.422 --> 00:18:13.392 line:95%,end
I'm dazed-- unbroken.

00:18:13.459 --> 00:18:18.363 line:95%,end
I can fly with anyone.

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:22.000 line:95%,end
Oh, I won't waste time.

00:18:22.067 --> 00:18:25.971 line:95%,end
I won't break.

00:18:26.038 --> 00:18:30.109 line:95%,end
I hear echoes inside myself.

00:18:30.175 --> 00:18:33.745 line:95%,end
They're banging the
walls for help--

00:18:33.812 --> 00:18:39.785 line:95%,end
some kind of malady I can't
spell eating at my heart,

00:18:39.852 --> 00:18:46.458 line:95%,end
choking on the darkness
outside myself,

00:18:46.525 --> 00:18:52.798 line:95%,end
banging the walls to tell me
that I'm not an empty shell.

00:18:53.765 --> 00:18:55.901 line:95%,end
It comes from inside of me.

00:18:55.968 --> 00:19:02.608 line:95%,end
My reality is
nothing I can't be.

00:19:02.674 --> 00:19:07.112 line:95%,end
Echoes inside myself-- yeah,
they're banging the walls

00:19:07.179 --> 00:19:13.385 line:95%,end
to tell me that I
don't need no help,

00:19:13.452 --> 00:19:20.459 line:95%,end
'cause I can be all that
I dream inside myself.

00:19:21.727 --> 00:19:24.329 line:95%,end
So I won't wait.

[cheers and applause]

00:19:37.242 --> 00:19:39.111 line:95%,end
All right.
Great job, girls.

00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:41.413 line:95%,end
So, Kelly, everybody is
curious about your return

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:42.981 line:95%,end
to the Abby Lee Studio.

00:19:43.048 --> 00:19:45.684 line:95%,end
According to Abby herself,
you snuck back in.

00:19:45.751 --> 00:19:47.920 line:95%,end
Let's take a closer look and
see what really happened.

00:19:47.986 --> 00:19:49.388 line:95%,end
[phone rings]

00:19:49.454 --> 00:19:51.323 line:95%,end
- Who are you calling?
- I'm calling Kelly.

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:53.525 line:95%,end
- Why?
- Because.

00:19:53.592 --> 00:19:54.893 line:95%,end
I don't owe you an explanation.

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.628 line:95%,end
I know you don't,
but I think it's rude.

00:19:56.695 --> 00:19:58.564 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Kelly?

00:19:59.097 --> 00:20:00.866 line:5%,start
- Hi.
- Hi, Kel.

00:20:00.933 --> 00:20:05.337 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: I'm just calling to let
you know that Abby's not here.

00:20:05.671 --> 00:20:07.372 line:95%,end
I don't know where she is.

00:20:07.673 --> 00:20:09.708 line:95%,end
But anyhow, the girls are
learning a group dance.

00:20:09.775 --> 00:20:12.444 line:95%,end
And since you kind of made
your statement that you're back

00:20:12.511 --> 00:20:15.380 line:95%,end
on the team, I don't know
if you have plans for your girls

00:20:15.447 --> 00:20:16.615 line:95%,end
to dance this week.

00:20:16.682 --> 00:20:19.117 line:95%,end
But if you do or if you want
them to learn the dance,

00:20:19.184 --> 00:20:22.054 line:95%,end
I would suggest that you get here.

00:20:23.055 --> 00:20:24.790 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: All right.
I'll talk to you later.

00:20:24.856 --> 00:20:27.159 line:95%,end
Kelly can come back right now,
because Abby's not here.

00:20:27.226 --> 00:20:29.695 line:95%,end
So she's not facing that
big fight at the front door,

00:20:29.761 --> 00:20:31.563 line:95%,end
and her girls can come and dance,

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:34.066 line:95%,end
which is all Kelly really wanted
in the first place.

00:20:34.132 --> 00:20:35.734 line:95%,end
KELLY: I always come back to the studio,

00:20:35.801 --> 00:20:38.036 line:95%,end
because my girls miss their family.

00:20:38.103 --> 00:20:40.706 line:95%,end
They have been together since
they were three years old.

00:20:40.839 --> 00:20:44.643 line:95%,end
And as much as Abby doesn't like it,
we are part of this team.

00:20:46.745 --> 00:20:48.213 line:95%,end
Excuse me.

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.716 line:95%,end
My kids are here to learn the group dance.

00:20:50.782 --> 00:20:52.951 line:95%,end
So Kelly, why did you
come back to the studio?

00:20:53.018 --> 00:20:54.620 line:95%,end
Because I'm part of the team.

00:20:54.686 --> 00:20:58.357 line:95%,end
And every single one of the moms
and the kids want my kids here.


00:20:58.423 --> 00:21:00.359 line:95%,end
JEFF: So Leslie, I'm told
that you may not agree

00:21:00.425 --> 00:21:02.227 line:95%,end
with this version of the story.

00:21:02.294 --> 00:21:04.096 line:95%,end
Do you think she came
back at the right time?

00:21:04.696 --> 00:21:07.065 line:95%,end
No. I think it was wrong
for her to show up then.

00:21:07.132 --> 00:21:08.333 line:95%,end
Why?

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.868 line:95%,end
LESLIE: Because it was
uncomfortable for Payton and I.

00:21:10.102 --> 00:21:12.738 line:95%,end
We came in to fill in
for you and your child.

00:21:12.804 --> 00:21:14.706 line:95%,end
KELLY: And did I tell
Payton and you to leave?

00:21:14.906 --> 00:21:16.375 line:95%,end
LESLIE: But it still
makes her uncomfortable

00:21:16.441 --> 00:21:18.010 line:95%,end
because she's
there to take Brooke's spot.

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:19.111 line:95%,end
I'm a part of the team.

00:21:19.211 --> 00:21:20.612 line:95%,end
How many times do you
think it takes for you

00:21:20.679 --> 00:21:21.913 line:95%,end
not to be able to come back?

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:24.049 line:95%,end
Do we want to bring up why I leave?

00:21:24.116 --> 00:21:26.618 line:95%,end
ABBY: You are solely responsible.

00:21:26.685 --> 00:21:28.220 line:95%,end
That's why I leave.
ABBY: It is your behavior.

00:21:28.287 --> 00:21:29.621 line:95%,end
Because I take responsibility.

00:21:29.688 --> 00:21:32.057 line:95%,end
You are responsible for
their decline in their dancing.

00:21:32.124 --> 00:21:33.425 line:95%,end
Every time they miss, you're--

00:21:33.492 --> 00:21:35.427 line:95%,end
And that's why I leave,
because you treat them the way

00:21:35.494 --> 00:21:36.728 line:95%,end
you do, so I pull them out.

00:21:36.795 --> 00:21:37.896 line:95%,end
Let's switch gears for just a second--

00:21:37.963 --> 00:21:39.064 line:95%,end
- Wacko.
- --and lighten the--

00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:40.265 line:95%,end
KELLY: Did you just say I
should be committed as a wacko?

00:21:40.332 --> 00:21:41.533 line:95%,end
No.

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.035 line:95%,end
I said if you want to get
off the show, you can.

00:21:43.101 --> 00:21:44.236 line:95%,end
JEFF: No, no, no.
- Because if you want to call me--

00:21:44.369 --> 00:21:46.371 line:95%,end
JEFF: No, no, no.
- Now wait a minute. She can sit there--

00:21:46.438 --> 00:21:47.472 line:95%,end
Thank you, 'cause I'm going to dinner.

00:21:47.572 --> 00:21:48.607 line:95%,end
KELLY: --and say I should
be committed as a wacko--

00:21:48.707 --> 00:21:49.775 line:95%,end
- And it's OK?
- No, I did not say that.

00:21:49.841 --> 00:21:51.777 line:95%,end
I said if you want to get off you can.

00:21:51.843 --> 00:21:53.245 line:95%,end
KELLY: OK.

00:21:53.312 --> 00:21:54.446 line:95%,end
Well, I'm not a wacko.

00:21:54.513 --> 00:21:56.882 line:95%,end
JEFF: All right.
- Your eyes say something different.

00:21:56.948 --> 00:21:57.949 line:95%,end
OK.
- Good.

00:21:58.050 --> 00:21:59.051 line:95%,end
- Abby, hold on.
- Party's over.

00:21:59.117 --> 00:22:01.019 line:95%,end
JEFF: Where are you going?
What's that about?

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:04.289 line:95%,end
Every time I say something
to Abby about the way

00:22:04.356 --> 00:22:07.926 line:95%,end
she treats my kids, she runs.

00:22:07.993 --> 00:22:09.861 line:95%,end
JEFF: Well, Hurricane Abby just left.

00:22:09.928 --> 00:22:11.263 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Blew out of town.
JEFF: All right.

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:13.165 line:95%,end
Well, certainly, we can't go
any further without bringing out

00:22:13.231 --> 00:22:14.900 line:95%,end
the other moms, as they're certain to have

00:22:14.966 --> 00:22:16.668 line:95%,end
an opinion on this subject
and all subjects.

00:22:16.735 --> 00:22:18.970 line:95%,end
So Melissa, Jill, and
Holly, please come on out.

00:22:19.037 --> 00:22:21.239 line:95%,end
[cheers and applause]

00:22:25.143 --> 00:22:26.244 line:95%,end
- Hi, ladies.
- Hi.

00:22:26.311 --> 00:22:28.180 line:95%,end
- Hello.
- Va-va-voom.

00:22:28.246 --> 00:22:30.115 line:95%,end
- She wore white.
- There is the team.

00:22:30.382 --> 00:22:32.918 line:95%,end
JEFF: Welcome, ladies. All right,
so I wanna know. Let's get right to it.

00:22:32.984 --> 00:22:35.020 line:95%,end
What do you have to say
about Abby's disappearance?

00:22:35.087 --> 00:22:37.756 line:95%,end
The only thing we asked
is that she had the courtesy

00:22:37.823 --> 00:22:39.157 line:95%,end
to give us a call--
JEFF: Right.

00:22:39.224 --> 00:22:41.093 line:95%,end
--to notify us. That was the only thing.
That's just what I'm--

00:22:41.159 --> 00:22:42.527 line:95%,end
- So she didn't.
JILL: Nope. We didn't--

00:22:42.594 --> 00:22:44.129 line:95%,end
- She didn't tell you.
- She disappeared.

00:22:44.196 --> 00:22:45.697 line:95%,end
She just left us high and dry.

00:22:45.764 --> 00:22:46.965 line:95%,end
How do we feel about this?

00:22:47.032 --> 00:22:49.368 line:95%,end
Like, she didn't show up for
two competitions and she just--

00:22:49.434 --> 00:22:50.602 line:95%,end
That's just what happens with Kelly.

00:22:50.669 --> 00:22:52.170 line:95%,end
JEFF: She walked out.
- She just had a little temper tantrum.

00:22:52.371 --> 00:22:54.539 line:95%,end
I take a little bit different
take on all this, though.

00:22:54.606 --> 00:22:56.375 line:95%,end
You women talk about her.

00:22:56.875 --> 00:22:58.210 line:95%,end
Your analogies about her--

00:22:58.276 --> 00:22:59.444 line:95%,end
Have you heard the things
that she says about us?

00:22:59.511 --> 00:23:01.446 line:95%,end
LESLIE: You tell-- you constantly
don't want her near your kids.

00:23:01.513 --> 00:23:03.415 line:95%,end
Whether Abby wasn't by
her mother's bedside--

00:23:03.482 --> 00:23:04.783 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: We never said that.
MELISSA: But you weren't there.

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:05.984 line:95%,end
- Because you were not there.
- No, no, no.

00:23:06.051 --> 00:23:07.285 line:95%,end
LESLIE: You are all hypocrites.
- Gia had not--

00:23:07.352 --> 00:23:08.820 line:95%,end
One minute, you don't want
Abby near your children.

00:23:09.054 --> 00:23:11.690 line:95%,end
And the next minute you will
find every little detail

00:23:11.757 --> 00:23:12.758 line:95%,end
and complain about why she's not there.

00:23:12.824 --> 00:23:14.025 line:95%,end
JILL: We're not complaining about--

00:23:14.092 --> 00:23:15.494 line:95%,end
- That's all you did.
- All right. hold on. Hold on.

00:23:15.594 --> 00:23:17.963 line:95%,end
All we wanted was a phone call
where she was. That's it.

00:23:18.029 --> 00:23:20.732 line:95%,end
JEFF: So Abby didn't show up
to two competitions in a row. Why?

00:23:20.799 --> 00:23:23.435 line:95%,end
Let's watch a clip which may
enlighten us all about what happened.

00:23:24.703 --> 00:23:26.805 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Does anybody
follow Abby on Instagram?

00:23:27.205 --> 00:23:29.508 line:95%,end
Abby just put a picture of
herself up on Instagram.

00:23:29.708 --> 00:23:31.176 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Oh, that's really recent.

00:23:31.877 --> 00:23:33.845 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: Abby's all about making money.

00:23:33.912 --> 00:23:36.381 line:95%,end
If some competition dangles
cash in front of her

00:23:36.448 --> 00:23:38.717 line:95%,end
to go judge a competition,
she'll be there.

00:23:38.784 --> 00:23:40.952 line:95%,end
- Maybe she's at a meet and greet.
- True.

00:23:41.286 --> 00:23:44.423 line:95%,end
She was out of competition
for three hours, so she is very--

00:23:44.489 --> 00:23:46.391 line:95%,end
JILL: But she didn't to tell us that.

00:23:46.458 --> 00:23:48.727 line:95%,end
JEFF: All right. So Christi,
now, we understand that you all

00:23:48.794 --> 00:23:50.695 line:95%,end
had a pact regarding
Abby's competition show--

00:23:50.762 --> 00:23:52.230 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Yes.
- --which is airing now.

00:23:52.297 --> 00:23:53.398 line:95%,end
So tell us about it.

00:23:53.498 --> 00:23:57.269 line:95%,end
So we said as a group we were going to
not send our children if asked.

00:23:57.702 --> 00:24:00.005 line:95%,end
And Melissa sent Maddie.

00:24:00.906 --> 00:24:02.174 line:95%,end
JEFF: So how did you feel?

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.009 line:95%,end
Did you feel betrayed by
Melissa that she broke the pact?

00:24:04.075 --> 00:24:05.076 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Absolutely.

00:24:05.143 --> 00:24:06.244 line:95%,end
Why does there have to be a pact?

00:24:06.311 --> 00:24:07.746 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Well, there isn't anymore.
I mean--

00:24:07.813 --> 00:24:09.347 line:95%,end
LESLIE: Why did there have to
be a pact that you asked for?

00:24:09.414 --> 00:24:10.882 line:95%,end
Don't talk about something
you don't know about.

00:24:11.016 --> 00:24:12.250 line:95%,end
- We all follow your rules.
- That's foolish.

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:14.986 line:95%,end
Because if there's
an opportunity for each one of you girls,

00:24:15.053 --> 00:24:16.755 line:95%,end
Melissa is the smart one.
LESLIE: Yes, you are.

00:24:16.822 --> 00:24:18.223 line:95%,end
I am gonna take an opportunity.

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:19.357 line:95%,end
KRISTIE: Because the children--
LESLIE: Hats off to you.

00:24:19.424 --> 00:24:20.425 line:95%,end
The children come first,
other than a friend.

00:24:20.492 --> 00:24:21.560 line:95%,end
LESLIE: You're the smart one.

00:24:21.626 --> 00:24:23.328 line:95%,end
HOLLY: The only issue we had with Melissa,
to be honest with you,

00:24:23.395 --> 00:24:25.564 line:95%,end
was if she was inclined to do it,

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:27.132 line:95%,end
she should have just been upfront.
That's it.

00:24:27.199 --> 00:24:29.701 line:95%,end
All right. Well, let's watch this clip
to see how the moms really

00:24:29.768 --> 00:24:31.336 line:95%,end
felt about Melissa's decision.

00:24:32.337 --> 00:24:34.406 line:95%,end
You know what I think is
really sad is that

00:24:34.473 --> 00:24:38.210 line:95%,end
you point blank said to all of us
that when the children were invited,


00:24:38.276 --> 00:24:39.945 line:95%,end
that you were not gonna to send Maddie.

00:24:40.011 --> 00:24:41.313 line:95%,end
But then you screwed the group.

00:24:41.379 --> 00:24:43.114 line:95%,end
When we made an agreement
about what we were gonna do

00:24:43.181 --> 00:24:45.984 line:95%,end
with the girls, we all stood by that,
and you didn't.

00:24:46.618 --> 00:24:50.121 line:95%,end
KELLY: Melissa, if I would have
disobeyed the group

00:24:50.188 --> 00:24:51.623 line:95%,end
and went and had Brooke do it--

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:53.291 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Brooke would be
in much better standing.

00:24:53.358 --> 00:24:55.060 line:95%,end
Brooke wouldn't have been
at the bottom of the pyramid

00:24:55.126 --> 00:24:56.661 line:95%,end
this week, I can guarantee you that.

00:24:56.728 --> 00:24:59.865 line:95%,end
But I didn't do that,
because I'm a team player.

00:24:59.931 --> 00:25:02.634 line:95%,end
You know what?
That's my choice as a mother.

00:25:02.701 --> 00:25:05.504 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: So basically, your choice
as a mother is dance trumps all.

00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:06.738 line:95%,end
Just to be clear.

00:25:06.872 --> 00:25:07.939 line:95%,end
[laughs]

00:25:08.006 --> 00:25:09.574 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Well--
- That's funny.

00:25:10.308 --> 00:25:11.376 line:95%,end
Why is that funny?

00:25:11.443 --> 00:25:12.978 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Because you know
Christi sneaks all the time.

00:25:13.044 --> 00:25:15.714 line:95%,end
- You said it.
KELLY: No. I'm saying I wouldn't do it.

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:17.015 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Oh, OK.
CHRISTI: What do I sneak about?

00:25:17.082 --> 00:25:18.550 line:95%,end
MELISSA: What do you mean?
You talk to everybody.

00:25:18.617 --> 00:25:19.684 line:95%,end
Give me a break.

00:25:19.751 --> 00:25:21.987 line:95%,end
If you could sleep with Abby,
you would and you know it.

00:25:22.053 --> 00:25:23.522 line:95%,end
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

00:25:23.588 --> 00:25:25.991 line:95%,end
Well, that's how you tend
to get ahead in life, Melissa.

00:25:26.057 --> 00:25:27.559 line:95%,end
Oh, yeah. I sleep with everybody.

00:25:27.626 --> 00:25:28.994 line:95%,end
You do-- boss.

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:30.729 line:95%,end
I've never slept with my boss.

00:25:30.795 --> 00:25:32.464 line:95%,end
[laughs] Yes, you did.
You married him.

00:25:32.531 --> 00:25:34.099 line:95%,end
Yes, I married Greg after--

00:25:34.165 --> 00:25:35.667 line:95%,end
Yeah, after you slept with
him and had an affair

00:25:35.734 --> 00:25:36.835 line:95%,end
when he had a wife.
MELISSA: I did not.

00:25:36.902 --> 00:25:38.270 line:95%,end
- And you had a husband.
MELISSA: Guess what?

00:25:38.336 --> 00:25:40.205 line:95%,end
I didn't sleep with him,
and don't start with me again, Christi.

00:25:40.272 --> 00:25:41.439 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: You did.
- You know what? I'm--

00:25:41.506 --> 00:25:42.908 line:95%,end
I know. Storm out-- we love it.

00:25:42.974 --> 00:25:44.376 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Oh, I am storming
out, because this is not

00:25:44.442 --> 00:25:45.977 line:95%,end
being brought up. Screw you.

00:25:46.044 --> 00:25:47.512 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I know.
- I did not sleep with my boss.

00:25:47.579 --> 00:25:49.080 line:95%,end
- All right. I'm quite fine with it.
- You want to play those games?

00:25:49.314 --> 00:25:50.348 line:95%,end
What's wrong?

00:25:50.415 --> 00:25:52.350 line:95%,end
JILL: She has to live with
the decision she made.

00:25:52.417 --> 00:25:53.685 line:95%,end
HOLLY: I'm like, that doesn't--

00:25:53.752 --> 00:25:55.887 line:95%,end
I'm not gonna sit up
here make this easy on her.

00:25:55.954 --> 00:25:58.657 line:95%,end
She didn't make it easy on
any of those six little girls.

00:25:59.057 --> 00:26:00.926 line:95%,end
She knew she had that coming.

00:26:01.259 --> 00:26:03.061 line:95%,end
So Melissa, why'd you break the pact?

00:26:03.128 --> 00:26:05.196 line:95%,end
My daughter wants to dance professionally,

00:26:05.263 --> 00:26:07.832 line:95%,end
so I have to take opportunities.
This pisses me off.

00:26:07.899 --> 00:26:09.701 line:95%,end
Why should I even be
in a pact with you guys

00:26:09.868 --> 00:26:11.570 line:95%,end
when you talk bad about my husband and me

00:26:11.636 --> 00:26:13.138 line:95%,end
and me having an affair, which I did not.

00:26:13.204 --> 00:26:15.440 line:95%,end
You-- Melissa, you seem really angry
at Christi. Like--

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:17.976 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I was pissed that
she said that about my husband, because--

00:26:18.043 --> 00:26:20.145 line:95%,end
JEFF: Right.
- --that has nothing to do with dance.

00:26:20.579 --> 00:26:21.913 line:95%,end
And she doesn't have
any correct information.

00:26:22.013 --> 00:26:23.214 line:95%,end
- That's shows her character.
JEFF: A low blow.

00:26:23.281 --> 00:26:24.382 line:95%,end
MELISSA: That's a low blow.
- You should be upset.

00:26:24.449 --> 00:26:25.550 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I am.
- That shows her character.

00:26:25.617 --> 00:26:26.618 line:95%,end
You should be upset.
- It's a low blow.

00:26:26.718 --> 00:26:28.119 line:95%,end
And I think, you know what?
Leave my husband out of it.

00:26:28.219 --> 00:26:30.689 line:95%,end
JEFF: And speaking of betrayal,
it was not just Melissa.

00:26:30.755 --> 00:26:32.591 line:95%,end
Jill also angered the moms--

00:26:32.657 --> 00:26:35.260 line:95%,end
namely, Christi Lukasiak,
when she said she'd do the same.

00:26:35.327 --> 00:26:36.595 line:95%,end
Take a look at this.
[music playing]

00:26:36.661 --> 00:26:39.364 line:95%,end
I think both of you have seen
how well it works for Melissa

00:26:39.431 --> 00:26:40.999 line:95%,end
to do whatever Abby wants to keep

00:26:41.066 --> 00:26:42.667 line:95%,end
their kids in her good graces.

00:26:42.734 --> 00:26:44.836 line:95%,end
And I think that you both
are headed down that path.

00:26:44.903 --> 00:26:46.004 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Are you insane?
- No.

00:26:46.071 --> 00:26:47.138 line:95%,end
Absolutely not.

00:26:47.205 --> 00:26:50.408 line:95%,end
When we all agreed not to send
our kids to Abby's West Coast competition,

00:26:50.475 --> 00:26:53.445 line:95%,end
I said to all of you
on the phone, I was asked.

00:26:53.678 --> 00:26:55.747 line:95%,end
Here and now, I said no.

00:26:55.914 --> 00:26:59.517 line:95%,end
So I need all of you to guarantee,
if you're asked, you're gonna say no.

00:26:59.584 --> 00:27:00.952 line:95%,end
Abby did ask Kendall to go.

00:27:01.019 --> 00:27:02.454 line:95%,end
She didn't ask her to perform.

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:03.588 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:27:03.655 --> 00:27:05.857 line:95%,end
So I said no.
I'm not gonna go and not perform.

00:27:05.924 --> 00:27:07.726 line:95%,end
But if she would have
been asked to perform?

00:27:08.126 --> 00:27:09.260 line:95%,end
I can't say that.

00:27:09.327 --> 00:27:10.562 line:95%,end
Probably not.

00:27:10.629 --> 00:27:11.963 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: It's time for me
to kick this bitch out.

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:13.598 line:95%,end
You need you see yourself to the door.

00:27:13.665 --> 00:27:16.034 line:95%,end
JILL: What?
HOLLY: Did you just say that?

00:27:16.101 --> 00:27:18.203 line:95%,end
Why do you want to be
divided all the time?

00:27:18.269 --> 00:27:19.771 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I'm not divided all the time.

00:27:19.838 --> 00:27:21.072 line:95%,end
I didn't lay down the gauntlet.

00:27:21.139 --> 00:27:22.273 line:95%,end
What's the gauntlet thing?

00:27:22.407 --> 00:27:23.608 line:95%,end
Stop talking. I'm walking out.

00:27:23.675 --> 00:27:25.744 line:95%,end
Why? Don't tell me to stop talking.

00:27:26.011 --> 00:27:27.679 line:95%,end
- Don't leave.
CHRISTI: I'm done.

00:27:30.849 --> 00:27:31.950 line:95%,end
Jill?

00:27:32.017 --> 00:27:33.451 line:95%,end
JILL: Well, it speaks for itself.

00:27:33.518 --> 00:27:36.788 line:95%,end
If Kendall had the opportunity
to dance on Abby's

00:27:36.855 --> 00:27:40.125 line:95%,end
Ultimate Competition Show
and promote herself,

00:27:40.191 --> 00:27:42.193 line:95%,end
I probably would have sent her, yes.

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:43.962 line:95%,end
Regardless of whatever a parent decides

00:27:44.029 --> 00:27:45.664 line:95%,end
to do for their child, you're a parent.

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:47.132 line:95%,end
That's your decision.

00:27:47.198 --> 00:27:48.967 line:95%,end
The only thing is, just
be upfront and honest

00:27:49.034 --> 00:27:50.235 line:95%,end
and be a person of your word.

00:27:50.301 --> 00:27:51.970 line:95%,end
Your word means a tremendous amount to me.

00:27:52.037 --> 00:27:54.572 line:95%,end
We make decisions
as a group about a lot of things,

00:27:54.639 --> 00:27:57.175 line:95%,end
and there's a lot of times
that you do what you want to do--

00:27:57.242 --> 00:27:58.410 line:95%,end
Absolutely.

00:27:58.476 --> 00:27:59.911 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: --you do what
what you want to do,

00:28:00.045 --> 00:28:01.312 line:95%,end
you do what you want to do,
and it has nothing to do with what

00:28:01.379 --> 00:28:02.647 line:95%,end
I say to do, because--

00:28:02.714 --> 00:28:04.949 line:95%,end
I think that
there's a misconception out here

00:28:05.016 --> 00:28:07.152 line:95%,end
that I tell you all what to do.

00:28:07.218 --> 00:28:09.187 line:95%,end
We talk about these things all the time.


00:28:10.689 --> 00:28:13.692 line:95%,end
So far, we've talked about
Christi Kulasiak versus Leslie

00:28:13.758 --> 00:28:15.694 line:95%,end
and Abby versus Kelly.
So what's left?

00:28:16.027 --> 00:28:17.829 line:95%,end
Jill versus Kristie Ray, of course.

00:28:18.096 --> 00:28:21.499 line:95%,end
Let's take a look as these two
headstrong moms battled it out.

00:28:22.767 --> 00:28:24.002 line:95%,end
Asia's gonna work.
JILL: OK.

00:28:24.069 --> 00:28:25.470 line:95%,end
Let me get this straight to you.

00:28:25.537 --> 00:28:28.606 line:95%,end
Asia's gonna work and take jobs
and train whenever she can.

00:28:28.673 --> 00:28:29.941 line:95%,end
So if you have a problem with that--

00:28:30.008 --> 00:28:31.242 line:95%,end
I don't have a problem with that.

00:28:31.309 --> 00:28:33.211 line:95%,end
Well, obviously you do.
You just said, you weren't here.

00:28:33.278 --> 00:28:35.714 line:95%,end
So you have a problem with it.
If you're telling me that you--

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:37.716 line:95%,end
You-- did you not hear me say--

00:28:37.782 --> 00:28:39.551 line:95%,end
I didn't hear you
because you're switching.

00:28:39.617 --> 00:28:41.352 line:95%,end
JILL: --I had a problem with
where she was on the pyramid?

00:28:41.419 --> 00:28:43.822 line:95%,end
KRISTIE: I know.
- I don't care where the [bleep] you were.

00:28:43.888 --> 00:28:46.124 line:95%,end
- Excuse me?
- Did you hear me?

00:28:46.191 --> 00:28:49.094 line:95%,end
Whoa, whoa!
Oh! Whoa!

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:50.729 line:95%,end
Look at Jill drop the F-bomb.

00:28:50.795 --> 00:28:52.063 line:95%,end
You're screwed in the head.

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:54.799 line:95%,end
No, you're a hot mess, because
now you're dropping F-bombs.

00:28:54.866 --> 00:28:57.235 line:95%,end
Well, OK.
I think you're a hot mess.

00:28:57.302 --> 00:28:59.671 line:95%,end
You only get mad when you're wrong.

00:29:00.338 --> 00:29:01.439 line:95%,end
Nope.

00:29:01.506 --> 00:29:03.541 line:95%,end
My favorite part is, whoa, whoa!

00:29:03.608 --> 00:29:05.243 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Well, "nope" is one
of our words that we use.

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:07.445 line:95%,end
KRISTIE: Well, because I'm not allowed
to drop the F-bombs, so--

00:29:07.512 --> 00:29:09.114 line:95%,end
Well, we're not allowed to either, so--

00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:10.815 line:95%,end
Kristie, I've got--
I've got a question for Kristie.

00:29:10.882 --> 00:29:12.884 line:95%,end
Some fans consider Jill
to be a little bit pushy.

00:29:12.951 --> 00:29:13.985 line:95%,end
How do you describe her?

00:29:14.052 --> 00:29:17.722 line:95%,end
KRISTIE: My interaction with Jill
is always repeating myself.

00:29:17.789 --> 00:29:19.624 line:95%,end
I think she needs to concentrate
on Kendall

00:29:19.691 --> 00:29:21.659 line:95%,end
and not me and Asia
and she'll be less miserable.

00:29:21.726 --> 00:29:24.229 line:95%,end
JEFF: So Jill, why do you think
Kristie Ray bailed on the Dance Moms

00:29:24.295 --> 00:29:25.697 line:95%,end
just before the Nationals?

00:29:25.764 --> 00:29:27.499 line:95%,end
JILL: Oh, I know why.
She got a better offer.

00:29:27.565 --> 00:29:29.501 line:95%,end
KRISTIE: Mm-hmm. I did.
- She used our kids. She used Abby.

00:29:29.567 --> 00:29:31.202 line:95%,end
KRISTIE: Um, excuse me. Excuse me.

00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:32.403 line:95%,end
- Go ahead.
- Let me put it straight to you.

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:35.039 line:95%,end
I am not using your kid,
and especially not your kid.

00:29:35.106 --> 00:29:36.541 line:95%,end
JILL: Not my kid-- the team.
- Asia-- OK.

00:29:36.608 --> 00:29:37.709 line:95%,end
JILL: Abby.
- I'm not using the team.

00:29:37.776 --> 00:29:38.943 line:95%,end
Guess what?
- You do.

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:40.678 line:95%,end
KRISTIE: Asia's won seven times for Abby.
- Woo-hoo!!

00:29:40.745 --> 00:29:43.581 line:95%,end
KRISTIE: So get that straight
before you talk and run your mouth.

00:29:43.648 --> 00:29:45.216 line:95%,end
- OK.
- What she said. Yes.

00:29:45.283 --> 00:29:46.584 line:95%,end
JILL: OK. Yeah, I know.

00:29:46.651 --> 00:29:48.353 line:95%,end
I know how this is like a little team now.

00:29:48.419 --> 00:29:49.788 line:95%,end
LESLIE: Well, how did
Brooke get on the pyramid

00:29:49.854 --> 00:29:52.223 line:95%,end
when Payton danced and she
left the team to go cheer lead?

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:54.425 line:95%,end
It's the same thing. I didn't say a word.
MELISSA: She was at the end. She was last.

00:29:54.492 --> 00:29:55.527 line:95%,end
Yeah.

00:29:55.593 --> 00:29:56.795 line:95%,end
Payton wasn't even on the pyramid,

00:29:56.861 --> 00:29:58.196 line:95%,end
and she danced with you guys that week.
- Because she's not a part of the team.

00:29:58.263 --> 00:29:59.798 line:95%,end
LESLIE: But you didn't think
anything was wrong with that, though.

00:29:59.864 --> 00:30:01.199 line:95%,end
- But Asia was training.
- But Asia was on the team.

00:30:01.266 --> 00:30:03.635 line:95%,end
See, when people call you women out--
- But Asia was training.

00:30:04.135 --> 00:30:07.105 line:95%,end
--on your delusional thoughts,
you have a problem with it.

00:30:07.672 --> 00:30:10.141 line:95%,end
JILL: It's not delusional.
It was a fact.

00:30:10.208 --> 00:30:12.143 line:95%,end
LESLIE: That you gave anybody
that comes onto this team--

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:14.579 line:95%,end
any mom and child who is
here for the same reasons

00:30:14.646 --> 00:30:17.148 line:95%,end
that you are-- that you don't want it.

00:30:17.215 --> 00:30:20.285 line:95%,end
You really don't want
anybody else into your pack.

00:30:20.518 --> 00:30:23.588 line:95%,end
Next subject-- two moms
who didn't exactly see eye to eye

00:30:23.655 --> 00:30:24.923 line:95%,end
are Holly and Leslie.

00:30:24.989 --> 00:30:27.292 line:95%,end
Holly, you formed a strong
opinion about Leslie,

00:30:27.358 --> 00:30:28.993 line:95%,end
saying that she didn't fit in. All right.

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:31.429 line:95%,end
Well, let's take a closer
look at Holly and Leslie's

00:30:31.496 --> 00:30:34.766 line:95%,end
very different parenting methods
and you can make your own decision.

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:36.701 line:5%,start
LESLIE: You wouldn't like
me on this team anyway, though,

00:30:36.768 --> 00:30:38.803 line:5%,start
because I would
do everything for my kid.

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:39.938 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:30:40.004 --> 00:30:41.272 line:95%,end
I won't hurt your kids.

00:30:41.339 --> 00:30:43.608 line:95%,end
But if my child gets
an opportunity, I'm taking it.

00:30:43.675 --> 00:30:45.510 line:95%,end
HOLLY: We're not just raising dancers.

00:30:45.577 --> 00:30:47.212 line:95%,end
We're raising people.

00:30:47.278 --> 00:30:49.814 line:95%,end
No matter how much I want
Nia to succeed in life,

00:30:49.881 --> 00:30:52.517 line:95%,end
if she's not a good person,
then I have failed.

00:30:52.584 --> 00:30:55.553 line:95%,end
And that might be the reason
why Leslie doesn't quite fit in here.

00:30:55.753 --> 00:30:58.489 line:95%,end
Even Melissa and Jill,
the biggest Dance Moms around,

00:30:58.556 --> 00:31:01.025 line:95%,end
want more for their daughters
than stardom or fame.

00:31:01.092 --> 00:31:04.996 line:95%,end
I'd rather be who I am
and be not a success on Broadway,

00:31:05.063 --> 00:31:06.798 line:95%,end
because I can look myself in the mirror--

00:31:06.865 --> 00:31:08.199 line:95%,end
KELLY: Exactly, Holly.
- --for that dance on the stage.

00:31:08.299 --> 00:31:11.870 line:95%,end
LESLIE: When opportunity comes knocking,
you'd better take advantage of it.

00:31:11.936 --> 00:31:14.806 line:95%,end
- What kind of kid are you raising?
- I want my daughter to have this.

00:31:14.873 --> 00:31:16.341 line:95%,end
Shame on you.

00:31:16.407 --> 00:31:18.343 line:95%,end
So Leslie, what do you think
when you see that?

00:31:18.409 --> 00:31:20.879 line:95%,end
Do you think Holly's
parenting skills are soft?


00:31:21.412 --> 00:31:23.214 line:95%,end
No, I just think
it's taken out of context.

00:31:23.281 --> 00:31:24.749 line:95%,end
I think she doesn't understand me.

00:31:24.816 --> 00:31:27.952 line:95%,end
I will never be a mean person,
but I will lay it out on the line.

00:31:28.019 --> 00:31:32.590 line:95%,end
From the very beginning, Holly,
I am here for-- to get Payton ahead.

00:31:32.657 --> 00:31:34.525 line:95%,end
HOLLY: You shouldn't have
to compromise character

00:31:34.592 --> 00:31:37.362 line:95%,end
to get ahead and be successful.
There are values.

00:31:37.428 --> 00:31:42.233 line:95%,end
There's a moral fiber that as mothers,
we need to equip our daughters with.

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:44.903 line:95%,end
I don't think any one of
these kids are ruthless.

00:31:44.969 --> 00:31:47.272 line:95%,end
I think the parents might be,
but it doesn't matter.

00:31:47.338 --> 00:31:48.806 line:95%,end
It doesn't matter.
- I don't think we're ruthless.

00:31:48.873 --> 00:31:52.143 line:95%,end
Who here is ruthless?
It matters what the child wants.

00:31:52.443 --> 00:31:54.846 line:95%,end
JEFF: All right. It's time for another
incredible dance number,

00:31:54.913 --> 00:31:58.049 line:95%,end
and it's an aptly-named one for
this "Hurricane Abby Reunion."

00:31:58.116 --> 00:32:00.985 line:95%,end
It's a solo by Maddie called "Drowning."

00:32:01.052 --> 00:32:03.821 line:5%,start
[cheers and applause]

00:32:05.189 --> 00:32:12.196 line:5%,start
[MUSIC - I AM NOT LEFTHANDED, "LIFELINES"]

[MUSIC - I AM NOT LEFTHANDED, "LIFELINES"]

00:32:33.685 --> 00:32:38.323 line:95%,end
(SINGING) So I know
that this might calm down

00:32:40.925 --> 00:32:45.129 line:95%,end
and I know I could sink and not drown.

00:32:48.299 --> 00:32:53.705 line:95%,end
But treading all night's getting
old and sunrise these days

00:32:53.771 --> 00:32:55.239 line:95%,end
leaves me cold.

00:32:55.306 --> 00:32:59.043 line:95%,end
I know I can turn this around.

00:33:02.547 --> 00:33:08.019 line:95%,end
'Cause when I cut your lifeline,
I started falling

00:33:08.086 --> 00:33:10.355 line:95%,end
so far,

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:14.092 line:95%,end
I couldn't look back.

00:33:16.761 --> 00:33:23.735 line:95%,end
When I cut your lifeline,
you were calling so hard

00:33:23.801 --> 00:33:27.905 line:95%,end
and I couldn't shout back.

00:33:47.058 --> 00:33:49.193 line:95%,end
[cheers and applause]

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:54.165 line:95%,end
JEFF: All right.
Great job, Maddie.

00:33:54.232 --> 00:33:58.536 line:95%,end
So I've just been backstage and I
understand that we've come to an agreement

00:33:58.603 --> 00:34:00.038 line:95%,end
to have Abby come back.

00:34:00.104 --> 00:34:02.340 line:95%,end
And Kelly, unfortunately,
I need to ask you to leave,

00:34:02.407 --> 00:34:04.342 line:95%,end
because that was
the agreement that we came to.

00:34:04.409 --> 00:34:05.743 line:95%,end
- OK.
- Can I go too?

00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:07.145 line:95%,end
JEFF: No, you may not.

00:34:07.211 --> 00:34:08.780 line:95%,end
We're gonna find out
Abby's side of the story,

00:34:08.846 --> 00:34:11.482 line:95%,end
but we would prefer that
you excuse yourself at this point.

00:34:11.549 --> 00:34:13.518 line:95%,end
JILL: OK.
- So thank you very much for coming.

00:34:13.584 --> 00:34:14.886 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:34:17.288 --> 00:34:19.023 line:95%,end
JEFF: Here she is. She's back--
- Hello!

00:34:19.123 --> 00:34:20.158 line:95%,end
Abby Lee Miller.

00:34:20.224 --> 00:34:21.559 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:34:21.626 --> 00:34:23.461 line:95%,end
[cheers and applause]

00:34:27.365 --> 00:34:28.599 line:95%,end
Have a seat.


00:34:32.003 --> 00:34:34.305 line:95%,end
All right. So as you can see,
Abby's come back to join us.

00:34:34.505 --> 00:34:37.141 line:95%,end
I asked Kelly to leave so that
we could come back and hear

00:34:37.208 --> 00:34:39.177 line:95%,end
your side of the story, because
I know she upset you, you know,

00:34:39.277 --> 00:34:40.511 line:95%,end
when she was out here before.
- No.

00:34:40.578 --> 00:34:41.979 line:95%,end
She just is always the victim

00:34:42.046 --> 00:34:43.815 line:95%,end
and everybody is mean to her kids.

00:34:43.881 --> 00:34:46.751 line:95%,end
I love those two kids
like they were my own.

00:34:46.818 --> 00:34:49.987 line:95%,end
She has put this wedge in between us.

00:34:50.054 --> 00:34:52.090 line:95%,end
You have to put the work in.

00:34:52.156 --> 00:34:54.992 line:95%,end
JEFF: So you feel like you're still back
in the role of the teacher,

00:34:55.059 --> 00:34:56.360 line:95%,end
and she feels like you're being unfair.

00:34:56.427 --> 00:34:59.263 line:95%,end
Well, everyone whose kid's
not winning and not on top

00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:01.432 line:95%,end
always thinks I'm unfair.

00:35:01.499 --> 00:35:02.934 line:95%,end
JEFF: If we're all being honest here,

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.970 line:95%,end
the moms have an issue with you
getting up and walking off the show.

00:35:06.104 --> 00:35:08.573 line:95%,end
Because they say that
you're always trying to tell the kids

00:35:08.639 --> 00:35:11.676 line:95%,end
that you have to do your job.
The show must go on.

00:35:11.742 --> 00:35:13.111 line:95%,end
There's a work ethic.

00:35:13.211 --> 00:35:15.513 line:95%,end
And you didn't show up to
two competitions this year,

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:17.248 line:95%,end
and you just got up and
walked off your own show.

00:35:17.315 --> 00:35:18.583 line:95%,end
I know.

00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:20.351 line:95%,end
JEFF: Holly?

00:35:20.418 --> 00:35:23.187 line:95%,end
You're the leader of this
organization-- of this team.

00:35:23.254 --> 00:35:26.791 line:95%,end
You set the example
and the girls follow you.

00:35:26.858 --> 00:35:27.959 line:95%,end
Right, Holly.

00:35:28.025 --> 00:35:30.328 line:95%,end
So for you to walk off,
they think it's OK.

00:35:30.394 --> 00:35:32.063 line:95%,end
And that's because their leader
is walking or doesn't show up.

00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:33.598 line:95%,end
Well, you know what, Holly?

00:35:33.798 --> 00:35:36.434 line:95%,end
Every woman has a right to
change their mind, number one.

00:35:36.501 --> 00:35:38.870 line:95%,end
- I agree with that.
- And I've been doing this for 33 years.

00:35:38.936 --> 00:35:39.937 line:95%,end
Mm-hmm.

00:35:40.004 --> 00:35:42.640 line:95%,end
Let's say for 25 of those years,

00:35:42.707 --> 00:35:45.710 line:95%,end
I put my life on the back burner.

00:35:45.877 --> 00:35:51.549 line:95%,end
I put my aspirations aside
for other people's children.

00:35:51.616 --> 00:35:53.184 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Well,
without the explanation of why

00:35:53.251 --> 00:35:55.086 line:95%,end
you're walking off and doing those things,

00:35:55.153 --> 00:35:57.622 line:95%,end
they don't know the reason
why you're doing those things.

00:35:57.688 --> 00:36:00.558 line:95%,end
So give them a context, like
this is the reason why I walked off.

00:36:00.625 --> 00:36:01.959 line:95%,end
That's what they need to
hear from you because

00:36:02.026 --> 00:36:03.494 line:95%,end
you're their leader, so just to--
ABBY: OK, Holly.

00:36:03.561 --> 00:36:05.263 line:95%,end
I'll write it all down for Nia.
She'll get it.

00:36:05.696 --> 00:36:09.300 line:95%,end
JEFF: All right. On that note, we've been
teasing it throughout the episode

00:36:09.367 --> 00:36:12.737 line:95%,end
and it's finally time to reveal
the big news Abby has.

00:36:13.037 --> 00:36:16.407 line:95%,end
ABBY: My big news is this season,

00:36:16.474 --> 00:36:21.646 line:95%,end
we will be auditioning
nationwide for new members

00:36:21.712 --> 00:36:23.080 line:95%,end
of the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:36:23.147 --> 00:36:25.216 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:36:25.283 --> 00:36:26.551 line:95%,end
We're taking it on tour.

00:36:26.617 --> 00:36:28.386 line:95%,end
We're gonna be in four huge cities

00:36:28.452 --> 00:36:32.223 line:95%,end
just to audition for
the new Abby's Ultimate Dance Competition.

00:36:32.657 --> 00:36:36.594 line:95%,end
And then we're also going to
be auditioning for members

00:36:36.661 --> 00:36:40.531 line:95%,end
of the Abby Lee Dance Company
Elite Competition Team.

00:36:40.898 --> 00:36:43.534 line:95%,end
So when we go to a city
to attend the competition,

00:36:44.135 --> 00:36:46.904 line:95%,end
I will be hosting an open call.

00:36:46.971 --> 00:36:48.339 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:36:48.406 --> 00:36:51.108 line:95%,end
That's great.
I think that's great.

00:36:51.509 --> 00:36:54.011 line:95%,end
JILL: When you-- do you
consider this team elite?

00:36:54.078 --> 00:36:56.047 line:95%,end
Are you talking about older children?
Or is--

00:36:56.214 --> 00:36:58.916 line:95%,end
ABBY: You remember back when
we were at Nationals

00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:04.322 line:95%,end
and Chloe had to leave with her mom
and Kendall got the solo.

00:37:04.388 --> 00:37:05.890 line:95%,end
She had this amazing breakthrough.

00:37:05.957 --> 00:37:09.026 line:95%,end
She was absolutely stunning
and gorgeous on stage,

00:37:09.093 --> 00:37:10.928 line:95%,end
and she knew it
when she was out there performing.

00:37:10.995 --> 00:37:12.230 line:95%,end
She was in her element.

00:37:12.296 --> 00:37:14.899 line:95%,end
Then she didn't show up for Booty Camp.

00:37:14.966 --> 00:37:16.901 line:95%,end
- She missed all the rehearsals--
- No.

00:37:16.968 --> 00:37:19.904 line:95%,end
ABBY: All the lessons--
she's right back at the bottom, Jill.

00:37:19.971 --> 00:37:22.173 line:95%,end
You screwed up big time.
JILL: OK. No, I didn't.

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:23.674 line:95%,end
And I'm waiting for
someone to take her place.

00:37:23.741 --> 00:37:25.243 line:95%,end
I took a family vacation for five days.

00:37:25.309 --> 00:37:26.677 line:95%,end
