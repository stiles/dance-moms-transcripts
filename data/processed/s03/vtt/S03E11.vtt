ABBY LEE<i>: Previously on </i>Dance Moms...

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:05.805 line:5%,start
Unfortunately, Baby is really sick.
She passed away.

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:09.676 line:5%,start
ABBY LEE: She kept me sane.
She made everything okay.

00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:13.446 line:5%,start
- Maybe dedicate the dance to her?
- The girls would love that.

00:00:13.646 --> 00:00:16.649 line:5%,start
Screwing with my choreography
is very offensive.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.853 line:5%,start
You had to expect that I would be
here. This is my hometown.

00:00:20.086 --> 00:00:23.356 line:5%,start
ANNOUNCER: Maddie's performance
was dedicated to Broadway Baby.

00:00:23.623 --> 00:00:25.225 line:5%,start
- Kendall sucks!
- Shut up!

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:27.093 line:5%,start
- You shut up!
- Stop! Stop!

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.195 line:5%,start
Oh my god, Kelly, I need you.

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:31.464 line:5%,start
Give me a hug.

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:33.233 line:5%,start
ABBY LEE:<i> Coming up on </i>Dance Moms...

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:34.901 line:5%,start
It's speed dating.

00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:36.436 line:5%,start
How you doing?

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:38.438 line:5%,start
Do you own your own tuxedo?

00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:41.007 line:5%,start
I need somebody to rub my feet.

00:00:41.808 --> 00:00:44.744 line:5%,start
The duet will be Kendall and Nia.

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:47.047 line:5%,start
- Where's Jill?
- Having a private with Kendall.

00:00:48.114 --> 00:00:49.949 line:5%,start
I'm here to have my child dance.

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:51.718 line:5%,start
I don't feel like we're being a team.

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:54.254 line:5%,start
Jill will do anything to move
Kendall up that spot.

00:00:54.454 --> 00:00:56.589 line:5%,start
ABBY LEE: Do you want the mothers
to not be upset with you

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.725 line:5%,start
or do you want your kid to get better?

00:01:01.628 --> 00:01:04.931 line:95%,end
âª Get up, get on the floor âª

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:08.001 line:95%,end
âª My world is with my girls âª

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:10.370 line:95%,end
âª Livin' on the dance floor. âª

00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:14.174 line:5%,start
âª âª

00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:17.577 line:95%,end
Come on, girls, let's go!

00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:19.412 line:95%,end
Come on, move it, move it,
move it. Get in here.

00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:23.183 line:95%,end
Well, congratulations. You won.

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:26.486 line:95%,end
Was it your best performance?
Mm... no.

00:01:26.553 --> 00:01:30.790 line:95%,end
âª See a million colors
and you feel brand-new âª

00:01:30.857 --> 00:01:32.859 line:95%,end
âª It's a beautiful day âª

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:35.929 line:95%,end
âª It's a beautiful day... âª

00:01:35.995 --> 00:01:37.363 line:95%,end
Didn't we win by seven points?

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.033 line:95%,end
I'm not going to deny the fact
that you won. That's great.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.036 line:95%,end
But I don't think
it was your best performance.

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:45.171 line:95%,end
The routine had mistakes.

00:01:45.238 --> 00:01:49.042 line:95%,end
Chloe, why would you go out on stage
and not do the correct choreography?

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:53.279 line:95%,end
âª Look up at the sun
'cause it's shining for you... âª

00:01:53.346 --> 00:01:56.516 line:95%,end
Everybody else did the choreography
I gave them.

00:01:57.417 --> 00:01:59.786 line:95%,end
That's beginning to be a pattern
with you, isn't it, Chloe?

00:01:59.853 --> 00:02:02.055 line:95%,end
You're lucky you're even back
in this dance studio.

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:04.858 line:5%,start
I give Chloe a lot of credit
for what she's putting up with from Abby.

00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.293 line:5%,start
I mean, Abby is being
really hard on her,

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.761 line:95%,end
and she's taking it like a champ.

00:02:08.828 --> 00:02:11.564 line:95%,end
I guess she really wants
to be back on this pyramid.

00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:15.935 line:95%,end
On the bottom... Paige.

00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:18.738 line:95%,end
You were good.
I'm waiting for you to be great.

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:21.141 line:95%,end
Did you really use your face

00:02:21.207 --> 00:02:24.244 line:95%,end
and get into every single one
of those judges' hearts?

00:02:25.245 --> 00:02:27.280 line:95%,end
No. You need to work on that.

00:02:27.347 --> 00:02:30.850 line:95%,end
And next... Kendall.
You didn't stick out to me.

00:02:31.618 --> 00:02:34.821 line:95%,end
In your improv, it should have been,
like, "Ooh, wow, look at that.

00:02:34.888 --> 00:02:36.789 line:95%,end
Who's that?" I didn't do that.

00:02:36.856 --> 00:02:39.058 line:5%,start
Abby's heart was not
in that group number.

00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:41.027 line:5%,start
It wasn't a group number.

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:44.497 line:5%,start
She threw it together, the kids went out,
and they improv'd.

00:02:44.564 --> 00:02:48.468 line:95%,end
<i>How can you watch a child</i>
<i>and critique a child,</i>

00:02:48.535 --> 00:02:51.204 line:95%,end
<i>when really, there was</i>
<i>no choreography given?</i>

00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:54.607 line:95%,end
I understand someone has to be
on that bottom row,

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:56.376 line:95%,end
but I didn't think
it should have been Kendall.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.611 line:95%,end
Next is Brooke.

00:02:58.678 --> 00:03:01.181 line:95%,end
Brooke, you are 14 years old.

00:03:01.247 --> 00:03:03.750 line:95%,end
When are we going to see you stand out

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.086 line:95%,end
as the leader, as the foreman on the job?

00:03:07.987 --> 00:03:09.756 line:95%,end
As the role model?

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.226 line:95%,end
Next... Nia.

00:03:13.293 --> 00:03:16.529 line:95%,end
You're third on the pyramid.
You were third overall high score.

00:03:16.596 --> 00:03:19.866 line:5%,start
Nia is third on the pyramid this week,
and I'm ecstatic.

00:03:19.933 --> 00:03:23.670 line:5%,start
I'm really proud of my little girl.
She is moving up there.

00:03:23.736 --> 00:03:26.506 line:95%,end
And... Mackenzie.

00:03:27.173 --> 00:03:30.176 line:95%,end
Overall high score of the mini division.
You did a great job.

00:03:30.243 --> 00:03:32.779 line:95%,end
You went out there, and you won.

00:03:32.845 --> 00:03:37.083 line:95%,end
And on top of the pyramid,
going three for three,

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.286 line:95%,end
once again... is Maddie.

00:03:40.353 --> 00:03:45.258 line:95%,end
Maddie, not only did you win
the high score solo in your age division,

00:03:45.325 --> 00:03:50.330 line:95%,end
but you were also the highest-scoring solo
in the entire competition.

00:03:53.933 --> 00:03:56.736 line:95%,end
Now, Chloe, did you notice
that you're not on the pyramid?

00:03:57.737 --> 00:04:00.406 line:95%,end
You're not in it.
You're lucky to be here as it is.

00:04:00.473 --> 00:04:02.742 line:95%,end
You can't go out on stage
and do what you want.

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:04.510 line:95%,end
CHRISTI:<i> Abby is being so hard on Chloe,</i>

00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:06.613 line:95%,end
and I know that this is what
she does to dancers--

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:07.981 line:95%,end
she did it to Brooke and Kendall--

00:04:08.047 --> 00:04:11.517 line:95%,end
but as a mom, it's really hard for me
to watch Chloe go through this.

00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:12.885 line:95%,end
But I know it's what she wants,

00:04:12.952 --> 00:04:15.455 line:95%,end
and I know that she has to go through it
to get back on the pyramid.

00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:17.323 line:95%,end
And therefore,
I'm going to be there for Chloe.

00:04:18.458 --> 00:04:23.062 line:95%,end
This weekend, we will be traveling
to Bernardsville, New Jersey.

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:27.767 line:95%,end
So, you're going to get kids with
amazing technique and killer costumes.

00:04:27.834 --> 00:04:30.470 line:95%,end
They're going to be strong competitors.

00:04:30.837 --> 00:04:34.207 line:95%,end
Everyone will be in the group dance,
except Mackenzie.

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:38.611 line:95%,end
The music is entitled
"Your Dream Is My Dream."

00:04:39.512 --> 00:04:43.216 line:95%,end
And it's big, and it's grand,
and it's a beautiful piece of music.

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:45.518 line:95%,end
I'm going to be using a boy in the group.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.923 line:95%,end
Mackenzie, you're not in the group dance.
That means you're getting a solo.

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.594 line:95%,end
The name of your routine is "Love Is War."


00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:57.297 line:95%,end
Maddie, you're three for three.

00:04:58.331 --> 00:05:00.233 line:95%,end
I want to see if you can win again.

00:05:00.733 --> 00:05:03.836 line:95%,end
Your solo is entitled "Lifeline."

00:05:03.903 --> 00:05:06.506 line:95%,end
I have one more routine
to give out this week.

00:05:06.572 --> 00:05:09.309 line:95%,end
Hopefully, we're going
to have time to do a duet.

00:05:09.375 --> 00:05:13.112 line:95%,end
And the duet will be Kendall and Nia.

00:05:13.179 --> 00:05:16.082 line:95%,end
It's contemporary, but it's cool.

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:18.518 line:95%,end
And the name of it is "Dig It."

00:05:18.584 --> 00:05:20.019 line:95%,end
HOLLY: I hope this duet works out,

00:05:20.086 --> 00:05:23.289 line:95%,end
because the last time Nia had a duet,
things did not go so well.

00:05:23.356 --> 00:05:25.525 line:95%,end
You are a monstrosity of evil.

00:05:25.591 --> 00:05:27.660 line:95%,end
You're done. You're done. No duet.

00:05:27.727 --> 00:05:29.562 line:95%,end
- Yes, you are.
- I'll show you evil.

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.700 line:95%,end
All right, you guys are dismissed.
Thank you very much.

00:05:33.766 --> 00:05:35.601 line:95%,end
Ladies, spread apart. In the back.

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:39.806 line:95%,end
- Can I have my guest boy, please?
- Oh, my gosh.

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:42.041 line:95%,end
- Hello. How are you?
- Hi.

00:05:42.108 --> 00:05:44.544 line:95%,end
- It's good to see you.
- (girls cheering)

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.746 line:5%,start
(girls screaming) Nick!

00:05:46.813 --> 00:05:48.981 line:5%,start
- Oh, it's Nick!
- Oh, it's Nick!

00:05:49.048 --> 00:05:50.583 line:5%,start
Yay! Yay. We like Nick.

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.420 line:5%,start
âª You can cry,
and I want to save you tonight... âª

00:05:54.487 --> 00:05:55.621 line:95%,end
(audience whooping)

00:05:55.688 --> 00:05:57.857 line:95%,end
Ooh! There's a hug. Hubba, hubba.

00:05:58.324 --> 00:05:59.826 line:95%,end
(laughter)

00:05:59.892 --> 00:06:03.863 line:95%,end
So, do you know that
you're the male lead in this?

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.065 line:95%,end
- Yeah.
- Do you know who the female lead is?

00:06:06.132 --> 00:06:08.334 line:95%,end
- No. Brooke?
- Who do you want it to be?

00:06:08.401 --> 00:06:09.569 line:95%,end
- NICK: Is it Brooke?
- It's Brooke.

00:06:09.635 --> 00:06:10.737 line:95%,end
So, if she doesn't bring it,

00:06:10.803 --> 00:06:12.438 line:95%,end
- I'm picking somebody else.
- All right.

00:06:12.705 --> 00:06:14.907 line:95%,end
This week's routine is called

00:06:14.974 --> 00:06:17.677 line:5%,start
"Your Dream Will Be My Dream."
âª âª

00:06:17.744 --> 00:06:21.314 line:5%,start
It is musical theater in nature,
but it's big,

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:24.350 line:95%,end
and it's grandiose, and it's beautiful.

00:06:24.417 --> 00:06:26.386 line:95%,end
So, you guys are doing...
da-da-da, da-da-da, da.

00:06:26.452 --> 00:06:28.788 line:95%,end
You're walking. Now, Maddie, pretend--

00:06:28.855 --> 00:06:30.690 line:95%,end
You're the one with the emotional face.

00:06:30.757 --> 00:06:33.025 line:95%,end
So, what I want you to do is pretend

00:06:33.092 --> 00:06:36.696 line:95%,end
that this is your mother, and she's dying.

00:06:36.763 --> 00:06:38.531 line:95%,end
And you're walking, you're...

00:06:38.598 --> 00:06:40.767 line:95%,end
And he's carrying her, she's so sick.

00:06:40.833 --> 00:06:44.670 line:95%,end
Now, he is secretly in love with Brooke,

00:06:44.737 --> 00:06:48.408 line:95%,end
and Brooke is dying.

00:06:48.474 --> 00:06:52.412 line:95%,end
<i>And in her final moment,</i>
<i>she asks this young man</i>

00:06:52.478 --> 00:06:54.480 line:95%,end
<i>to take care of her daughter.</i>

00:06:54.547 --> 00:06:58.251 line:95%,end
So, now we have a love story--
father and daughter,

00:06:58.317 --> 00:07:01.087 line:95%,end
<i>and we have the daughter</i>
<i>loving her mother,</i>

00:07:01.154 --> 00:07:04.557 line:95%,end
and then we have everybody else on stage
in love with this guy.

00:07:04.624 --> 00:07:08.060 line:95%,end
So, there's a whole lot going on
in two minutes,

00:07:08.127 --> 00:07:09.862 line:95%,end
but I think I can do it.

00:07:11.731 --> 00:07:14.167 line:95%,end
Oh, Brooke,
you're on the inside of Maddie!

00:07:14.233 --> 00:07:16.369 line:95%,end
âª ...for until the day we both awaken âª

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:17.870 line:95%,end
- Inside, Brooke!
- âª Your dream... âª

00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:19.005 line:95%,end
You know what's kind of sweet?

00:07:19.071 --> 00:07:21.140 line:95%,end
Like, everybody remembers
their first love.

00:07:21.207 --> 00:07:22.575 line:95%,end
- Like, even...
- Really?

00:07:22.642 --> 00:07:24.343 line:95%,end
- Ugh!
- Even if it ended up poorly,

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:26.546 line:95%,end
- everyone remembers...
- Mine was not a good memory.

00:07:26.612 --> 00:07:28.247 line:95%,end
And your other loved is dead.

00:07:28.581 --> 00:07:29.715 line:95%,end
- Yes.
- And he...

00:07:29.782 --> 00:07:30.783 line:95%,end
Now I have Randy.

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:32.552 line:95%,end
- But guess what? He loved you.
- Lucky me.

00:07:32.618 --> 00:07:34.854 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Okay,
even if it didn't end great,

00:07:34.921 --> 00:07:36.489 line:95%,end
like, if they're in jail or dead, Kelly...

00:07:36.722 --> 00:07:37.723 line:95%,end
(laughing)

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:41.027 line:95%,end
...but none of these girls
have experienced that.

00:07:41.093 --> 00:07:42.995 line:95%,end
- And, at some day, they will.
- HOLLY: Oh, my gosh.

00:07:43.062 --> 00:07:44.931 line:95%,end
And that's kind of fun to go through that.

00:07:44.997 --> 00:07:47.066 line:95%,end
Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn.

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:49.735 line:95%,end
Can you... can you almost break

00:07:49.802 --> 00:07:52.004 line:95%,end
and, like, rond de jambe that around,

00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:53.873 line:95%,end
and then start your turn here?

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.141 line:95%,end
Who's Abby's first love?

00:07:55.208 --> 00:07:57.176 line:95%,end
I don't think anybody has loved Abby back.

00:07:57.243 --> 00:07:58.845 line:95%,end
Well, maybe that's what she needs.

00:07:58.911 --> 00:07:59.912 line:95%,end
- Oh.
- Oh, yeah!

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:02.181 line:95%,end
- JILL: She needs more than that.
- That's what I said.

00:08:02.248 --> 00:08:04.350 line:95%,end
I would love to do speed dating for her.

00:08:04.584 --> 00:08:06.519 line:95%,end
Have her sit and have a line of men.

00:08:06.586 --> 00:08:07.887 line:95%,end
Is there a curtain?

00:08:07.954 --> 00:08:09.422 line:95%,end
KELLY: I-I'm telling you one thing.

00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:11.824 line:95%,end
You should tell her
not to wear her Shamu outfit.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.962 line:95%,end
I want to do speed dating,
but I want to be able to see...

00:08:16.028 --> 00:08:19.232 line:95%,end
- I want, like, six foot, four...
- You're married.

00:08:19.298 --> 00:08:21.667 line:95%,end
built... I know,
but I want to do it all again.

00:08:21.734 --> 00:08:23.102 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: Ladies!

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:24.370 line:95%,end
Ooh! Sorry.

00:08:24.437 --> 00:08:26.939 line:95%,end
I'm-I'm trying to teach.
You're being very distracting.

00:08:27.006 --> 00:08:29.442 line:95%,end
I know there's something going on
with the moms upstairs,

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:32.245 line:95%,end
because they're all laughing
and getting along.

00:08:32.311 --> 00:08:34.213 line:95%,end
You know that means they're up to no good.

00:08:34.447 --> 00:08:36.649 line:95%,end
Here: "See photos of singles near you."

00:08:36.716 --> 00:08:38.518 line:95%,end
Okay. You got in?

00:08:38.584 --> 00:08:40.219 line:95%,end
Okay, I'm in. I'm in, I'm in!

00:08:40.286 --> 00:08:41.721 line:95%,end
- MELISSA: Okay.
- JILL: Oh, let's look at the men.

00:08:41.787 --> 00:08:42.855 line:95%,end
Oh, this guy looks good.

00:08:43.723 --> 00:08:47.460 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Well, she can't
exactly date a lightweight.

00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:49.362 line:95%,end
(laughs) She would never
be able to be on top.

00:08:49.428 --> 00:08:50.763 line:95%,end
(laughing)

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:52.965 line:95%,end
That's all the time we have for today.

00:08:53.032 --> 00:08:55.668 line:95%,end
Remember, it's a love story.

00:08:55.735 --> 00:08:57.637 line:95%,end
I need to see that connection.

00:08:58.404 --> 00:09:01.207 line:95%,end
And I need to see everybody else
being very, you know,

00:09:01.274 --> 00:09:04.710 line:95%,end
grandiose, and-and big
and watching this epic love story.

00:09:04.777 --> 00:09:07.079 line:95%,end
Like, "Oh, my goodness,
I wish he was my man."

00:09:07.313 --> 00:09:09.715 line:95%,end
All right. Bye.

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:19.525 line:95%,end
Look, they're... look.

00:09:20.626 --> 00:09:24.664 line:95%,end
- (screaming)
- (laughing)

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:26.933 line:95%,end
- Oh, no, she did not.
- Uh-oh.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.770 line:95%,end
She really needs to go on a date.

00:09:30.836 --> 00:09:34.540 line:95%,end
If helping Abby find a man
and find true love

00:09:34.607 --> 00:09:38.177 line:95%,end
makes Abby happy
and makes me look like a rock star,

00:09:38.244 --> 00:09:41.447 line:95%,end
it can only benefit
Kendall's dance career.

00:09:41.514 --> 00:09:43.716 line:95%,end
Abby, that was so cute.

00:09:43.783 --> 00:09:46.452 line:95%,end
And I wanted to know if you would go out
to dinner with me tomorrow night?

00:09:46.519 --> 00:09:48.220 line:95%,end
Are you hooking me up with a guy?


00:09:53.926 --> 00:09:57.630 line:5%,start
GIANNA: Five and six, seven, eight.
One, two.

00:09:59.465 --> 00:10:01.133 line:95%,end
GIANNA: You guys are late.

00:10:05.204 --> 00:10:06.205 line:95%,end
Where's Chloe?

00:10:07.974 --> 00:10:09.375 line:95%,end
Her mother isn't here either.

00:10:10.743 --> 00:10:13.079 line:95%,end
- Oh, crap.
- That's not good.

00:10:13.145 --> 00:10:14.914 line:5%,start
Christi and Chloe are running late,

00:10:14.981 --> 00:10:18.417 line:5%,start
and this is certainly
not the week for this to happen.

00:10:18.484 --> 00:10:21.954 line:95%,end
Like, she should've been here
a half an hour early.

00:10:22.655 --> 00:10:24.023 line:95%,end
Not a half an hour late.

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:26.025 line:95%,end
I hope Christi's not here,
like, on purpose.

00:10:26.092 --> 00:10:27.693 line:95%,end
I hope she's just running late.

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.762 line:95%,end
I guess it's probably difficult
for Chloe...

00:10:31.497 --> 00:10:34.934 line:95%,end
not getting the attention,
not getting the solo, not getting a duet.

00:10:35.001 --> 00:10:36.102 line:95%,end
- It happens to all of us.
- All of us.

00:10:36.168 --> 00:10:37.503 line:95%,end
- I hope.
- I told her, I said, you know what,

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:39.972 line:95%,end
last season--
actually, the last two seasons--

00:10:40.039 --> 00:10:41.907 line:95%,end
Nia was lucky to be in group dance.

00:10:41.974 --> 00:10:44.644 line:95%,end
She just was, like, saying to me, like,

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:47.246 line:95%,end
"I just don't know what I'm gonna to do,
Abby's so mean to Chloe."

00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:49.015 line:95%,end
And I'm sitting there, thinking to myself,

00:10:49.081 --> 00:10:51.617 line:95%,end
"Hello, do we not see
how she treats Paige?"

00:10:51.684 --> 00:10:52.685 line:95%,end
- (laughs)
- HOLLY: Exactly.

00:10:52.752 --> 00:10:54.520 line:95%,end
Like, I'm in the same boat you are.

00:10:54.587 --> 00:10:56.122 line:95%,end
There's nothing Christi can do.

00:10:56.188 --> 00:10:58.057 line:95%,end
Keep that circle big!

00:10:58.991 --> 00:10:59.992 line:95%,end
Big!

00:11:02.228 --> 00:11:03.629 line:95%,end
- Hello.
- MOMS: Hi.

00:11:03.696 --> 00:11:05.998 line:95%,end
- Oh, you're fancy.
- Yeah, I'm super fancy.

00:11:06.065 --> 00:11:07.066 line:95%,end
Hello.

00:11:07.133 --> 00:11:08.300 line:95%,end
- How cute!
- I was texting you galore.

00:11:08.367 --> 00:11:11.037 line:95%,end
CHRISTI:<i> There was so much traffic,</i>
<i>I couldn't avoid being late.</i>

00:11:11.103 --> 00:11:13.339 line:95%,end
<i>I really just hope</i>
<i>Abby doesn't blame Chloe,</i>

00:11:13.406 --> 00:11:15.307 line:5%,start
you know, for the pile-up on Route 130.

00:11:15.374 --> 00:11:16.909 line:95%,end
So, what did I miss?
(sighs)

00:11:16.976 --> 00:11:18.811 line:95%,end
- Melissa-- the limo.
- For what?

00:11:18.878 --> 00:11:21.347 line:95%,end
- For Abby's...
- Abby. We're going out to dinner tonight.

00:11:21.414 --> 00:11:22.682 line:95%,end
Where are we going?

00:11:22.748 --> 00:11:24.850 line:95%,end
Speed dating event.

00:11:24.917 --> 00:11:26.952 line:95%,end
At Atria's.

00:11:27.019 --> 00:11:28.087 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Cool!

00:11:28.154 --> 00:11:30.990 line:95%,end
Let's just hope and pray that
there's some speed daters

00:11:31.057 --> 00:11:32.692 line:95%,end
that are gonna, like, take the bait.

00:11:32.758 --> 00:11:35.661 line:95%,end
Well, I just feel sorry for the man
who ends up with her.

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:40.499 line:5%,start
Go ahead... to one knee... okay.

00:11:40.566 --> 00:11:44.470 line:5%,start
Then you went up and shot your leg out
and hit the floor, boom.

00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:47.640 line:95%,end
Now, pull it in, roll over
and start the pee wees.

00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:51.143 line:95%,end
One, two, three...

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:52.478 line:95%,end
Straight knees, straight knees.

00:11:53.479 --> 00:11:56.148 line:95%,end
You need to do four. Four. Four.

00:11:56.215 --> 00:11:58.818 line:5%,start
This week, my solo
is called "Love Is War,"

00:11:58.884 --> 00:12:03.055 line:95%,end
and it's about a couple,
and they get on each other's nerves

00:12:03.122 --> 00:12:04.824 line:95%,end
and fight a lot.
(laughs)

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:07.827 line:95%,end
You have to walk in here tomorrow
and do this dance with the music

00:12:07.893 --> 00:12:09.962 line:95%,end
and have the timing right. Yes?

00:12:10.029 --> 00:12:13.332 line:95%,end
Remember, love is war.
And I mean war, baby.

00:12:14.433 --> 00:12:15.434 line:95%,end
Go.

00:12:16.969 --> 00:12:18.304 line:95%,end
Get the group in here.

00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:20.740 line:95%,end
Hi, Abb.

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:22.575 line:95%,end
- Hey.
- We have a surprise.

00:12:22.641 --> 00:12:24.577 line:95%,end
Come. Come on.

00:12:24.643 --> 00:12:28.547 line:95%,end
Today is the day
we're gonna go have our dinner date.

00:12:28.614 --> 00:12:30.516 line:95%,end
- And we're not taking any excuses.
- Really special.

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:31.851 line:95%,end
- You're coming.
- O-Okay.

00:12:31.917 --> 00:12:35.054 line:95%,end
I-I just have a lot to do,
as you know.

00:12:35.121 --> 00:12:37.022 line:95%,end
The sooner we go...
Oh, we can go right now?

00:12:37.089 --> 00:12:39.058 line:95%,end
- We go right now.
- Oh, I thought you meant later tonight.

00:12:39.125 --> 00:12:40.392 line:95%,end
HOLLY: No, we're gonna go
and come right back.

00:12:40.459 --> 00:12:43.629 line:95%,end
- I'll go now, I'm good.
- We'll go and come right back.

00:12:43.696 --> 00:12:45.531 line:95%,end
- It'll be fun.
- I'm not paying.

00:12:46.632 --> 00:12:47.633 line:95%,end
All right, you ready?

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.836 line:95%,end
I need someone to hang with.
Let's go.

00:12:50.903 --> 00:12:52.805 line:95%,end
KELLY: We'll pretend Abby's not there.

00:12:52.872 --> 00:12:55.241 line:95%,end
- Well, I should go just to spite her.
- Go, Mom.

00:12:56.842 --> 00:12:58.711 line:95%,end
Where are we going,
and why do we need a limo?

00:12:58.778 --> 00:13:00.346 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: That's a little obnoxious.

00:13:00.412 --> 00:13:02.081 line:95%,end
- Oh, just our girls' night out.
- Come on, you can bring the book.

00:13:02.314 --> 00:13:04.583 line:95%,end
Hurry up, they're gonna leave without us.

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:06.018 line:95%,end
Go, go... go-go quickly.

00:13:06.085 --> 00:13:08.187 line:95%,end
- My car is a limo.
- HOLLY: Want me to scoot all the way in?

00:13:08.254 --> 00:13:10.122 line:95%,end
- Absolutely.
- I'm not standing in the rain.

00:13:10.189 --> 00:13:11.390 line:95%,end
JILL: That's fine.

00:13:11.457 --> 00:13:13.359 line:95%,end
- ABBY LEE: Hey, Jill?
- What?

00:13:13.425 --> 00:13:15.094 line:95%,end
- Jill. Come here.
- Uh, hang on.

00:13:15.895 --> 00:13:18.764 line:95%,end
- You told me that Christi's not coming.
- Kelly snuck her in.

00:13:18.831 --> 00:13:19.832 line:95%,end
- Then I'm not going.
- Just come with us.

00:13:19.899 --> 00:13:21.433 line:95%,end
- No. No.
- Okay, then she'll...

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:22.601 line:95%,end
- Okay.
- Uh-uh. Nope.

00:13:22.668 --> 00:13:24.303 line:95%,end
I'd rather have you than Christi, so...

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:27.306 line:95%,end
You invited me the other night.
You never said a word about the mothers.

00:13:27.373 --> 00:13:28.574 line:95%,end
Well, then Melissa got jealous.

00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:30.943 line:95%,end
- I have a whole studio that I'm running.
- Wait, listen.

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:34.079 line:95%,end
Melissa got jealous and rented the limo,
so I had to invite them all.

00:13:34.146 --> 00:13:35.948 line:95%,end
Okay, give me one minute.
I'm gonna tell Christi

00:13:36.015 --> 00:13:38.050 line:95%,end
she's got to go,
and then we'll get you in.

00:13:38.717 --> 00:13:40.719 line:95%,end
- KELLY: Hi, I'm calling about...
- Christi, you got to stay home.

00:13:41.754 --> 00:13:43.088 line:95%,end
- Seriously?
- I'm sorry. Seriously.

00:13:43.155 --> 00:13:46.425 line:95%,end
- JILL: Because Abby won't come.
- That's fine. You guys have fun.

00:13:46.492 --> 00:13:47.660 line:95%,end
- We won't be long.
- HOLLY: I'm sorry.

00:13:47.726 --> 00:13:48.727 line:95%,end
- Oh, I don't care.
- JILL: An hour.

00:13:48.794 --> 00:13:51.230 line:95%,end
No, 'cause everybody's going to take
one look at her and run.

00:13:51.297 --> 00:13:53.432 line:95%,end
Okay, problem solved.
Let's go.

00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:54.567 line:95%,end
- Let's go.
- Yep. Let's go.

00:13:54.633 --> 00:13:58.137 line:5%,start
I don't know what's up with Jill,
or where the other moms want to take me,

00:13:58.204 --> 00:13:59.538 line:5%,start
but I'm confident.

00:13:59.605 --> 00:14:02.007 line:95%,end
Gianna's in rehearsal,
she can handle it.

00:14:02.074 --> 00:14:04.410 line:95%,end
GIANNA: Down, up, chainÃ©, chainÃ©, up.

00:14:05.211 --> 00:14:07.279 line:95%,end
CHRISTI:<i> I can't believe that</i>
<i>Jill kicked me out of the limo.</i>


00:14:07.346 --> 00:14:10.015 line:95%,end
And I can't believe that
none of the other moms stuck up for me.

00:14:10.082 --> 00:14:12.117 line:95%,end
I mean, not that I really want
to go hang out with Abby,

00:14:12.184 --> 00:14:13.385 line:95%,end
but it's the principle.

00:14:13.452 --> 00:14:15.454 line:95%,end
As moms, what are we teaching our kids?

00:14:15.521 --> 00:14:17.489 line:95%,end
You know, "Oh, it's okay
to stab someone in the back

00:14:17.556 --> 00:14:19.158 line:95%,end
as long as you get ahead, Jill."

00:14:19.625 --> 00:14:21.327 line:95%,end
JILL: All right, come on, guys,
we're going to have some fun.

00:14:21.393 --> 00:14:22.595 line:95%,end
(cork pops)

00:14:22.661 --> 00:14:24.163 line:95%,end
- (laughs)
- Always so sweet about it, though.

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:27.600 line:95%,end
- Huh?
- Oh, my gosh, this is, like, epic.

00:14:27.666 --> 00:14:29.368 line:95%,end
To friends.

00:14:29.435 --> 00:14:32.538 line:95%,end
- To winning this weekend.
- To Bernardsville.

00:14:32.605 --> 00:14:34.740 line:95%,end
- (laughs)
- ALL: Cheers.

00:14:34.807 --> 00:14:36.175 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: Oh, that's so sweet.

00:14:37.142 --> 00:14:41.313 line:95%,end
So, it's nice, Abby, to have,
like, a love kind of theme this week.

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:43.682 line:95%,end
- Love is war.
- Oh.

00:14:43.749 --> 00:14:46.085 line:95%,end
Sometimes when you're in love
with somebody,

00:14:46.151 --> 00:14:48.187 line:95%,end
you still fight, and you still argue.

00:14:48.254 --> 00:14:51.323 line:95%,end
So, Abby, what is your type
of man that you like?

00:14:52.491 --> 00:14:57.630 line:95%,end
Maybe kind of like, uh, a young
George Clooney with perfect teeth.

00:14:57.696 --> 00:14:59.798 line:95%,end
- Do you like guys like...
- That's, like, a must for me.

00:14:59.865 --> 00:15:01.500 line:95%,end
I think that I like people
that are worldly.

00:15:01.567 --> 00:15:03.602 line:95%,end
Like, people that speak
five languages fluently.

00:15:03.669 --> 00:15:06.338 line:95%,end
People that like to live,

00:15:06.405 --> 00:15:08.374 line:95%,end
that like to eat, enjoys dessert.

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.709 line:95%,end
Wants to order everything
on the menu, just to try it.

00:15:10.776 --> 00:15:12.711 line:95%,end
- You can't be pigeon-toed.
- (laughs)

00:15:12.778 --> 00:15:13.779 line:95%,end
Forget it.

00:15:13.846 --> 00:15:15.614 line:95%,end
So, are you just seeing one man right now?

00:15:17.216 --> 00:15:20.219 line:95%,end
- Yes.
- (laughs)

00:15:20.286 --> 00:15:23.489 line:95%,end
âª Whoo âª
âª Give me, give me, something hot... âª

00:15:23.555 --> 00:15:25.824 line:95%,end
- JILL: We have a surprise for you.
- Oh, I'm sure you do.

00:15:25.891 --> 00:15:28.227 line:95%,end
KELLY: I don't know
that I was so for this.

00:15:28.294 --> 00:15:29.428 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: Oh, really?

00:15:30.429 --> 00:15:31.997 line:95%,end
- Oh, this is pretty.
- This looks nice.

00:15:34.133 --> 00:15:36.101 line:95%,end
- Okay.
- Hi.

00:15:36.168 --> 00:15:37.603 line:95%,end
- Hi, how are you?
- Hi, Abby, I'm Casey.

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:39.338 line:95%,end
This is our contestant.

00:15:39.405 --> 00:15:40.773 line:95%,end
It's speed dating.

00:15:40.839 --> 00:15:42.541 line:95%,end
- (laughs)
- It's speed dating!

00:15:42.608 --> 00:15:44.310 line:95%,end
I saw something there. I was cracking up.

00:15:44.376 --> 00:15:45.811 line:95%,end
You are actually gonna
be number one--

00:15:45.878 --> 00:15:46.879 line:95%,end
- Abby Lee.
- Good.

00:15:46.946 --> 00:15:49.882 line:95%,end
Oh, thank God she's not number two,

00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:51.550 line:95%,end
'cause number two
is always the first to lose.

00:15:52.017 --> 00:15:54.820 line:95%,end
I had no idea this was
gonna be speed dating.

00:15:54.887 --> 00:15:59.325 line:95%,end
I think this is hysterical,
and I'm ready to meet some new guys.

00:15:59.391 --> 00:16:01.427 line:95%,end
You have a badge number,
he has a badge number.

00:16:01.493 --> 00:16:03.629 line:95%,end
So, you're gonna write down
his first name,

00:16:03.696 --> 00:16:05.464 line:95%,end
and then you're gonna circle
a "let's talk"

00:16:05.531 --> 00:16:07.066 line:95%,end
- or a "no, thank you."
- Okay.

00:16:07.132 --> 00:16:09.902 line:95%,end
- You both have to agree to get a match.
- Okay.

00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:11.603 line:95%,end
Okay, so we're gonna start our first date.

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:13.806 line:95%,end
So, let's just go over
a few things, Chris.

00:16:13.872 --> 00:16:15.174 line:5%,start
- All right, Abby.
- I have some questions for you.

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:16.475 line:5%,start
I have some answers.

00:16:16.542 --> 00:16:19.378 line:5%,start
- Do you own your own tuxedo?
- Yes, I do.

00:16:19.445 --> 00:16:21.313 line:95%,end
- Okay.
- As a matter of fact, I do.

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:22.848 line:95%,end
- All right.
And I can tie a bow tie.

00:16:22.915 --> 00:16:24.917 line:95%,end
- Ooh, that's like a bonus point.
- Actual bow tie.

00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:26.685 line:95%,end
And I'm, like, nervous for her.

00:16:26.752 --> 00:16:29.888 line:95%,end
No, I'm nervous for him, right?
I said that wrong.

00:16:29.955 --> 00:16:33.525 line:95%,end
How many times...
have you been to Disney World?

00:16:35.194 --> 00:16:37.062 line:95%,end
I like all kinds of guys.

00:16:37.129 --> 00:16:40.399 line:95%,end
And I have a whole list
of things that I require.

00:16:40.466 --> 00:16:42.267 line:95%,end
- Hi, how are you?
- MAN: Good, and how are you?

00:16:42.334 --> 00:16:43.669 line:5%,start
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm Karl.

00:16:44.069 --> 00:16:45.537 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: Okay. Ladies?

00:16:45.604 --> 00:16:47.006 line:95%,end
Karl...

00:16:47.072 --> 00:16:48.841 line:95%,end
- MELISSA: Hi, Karl.
- ...has gum.

00:16:50.009 --> 00:16:52.211 line:95%,end
But it must mean he has fresh breath.

00:16:52.277 --> 00:16:54.880 line:95%,end
My mom used to teach dance.
She used to own her own dance studio.

00:16:54.947 --> 00:16:57.516 line:95%,end
So you grew up around a dance studio?

00:16:57.583 --> 00:17:00.419 line:95%,end
I like him. I like that he's dressed nice.

00:17:00.486 --> 00:17:03.589 line:95%,end
HOLLY: I do, too. That he took
time and thought into his appearance.

00:17:03.655 --> 00:17:05.257 line:95%,end
- (bell rings)
- Oh, time's up, time's up.

00:17:05.324 --> 00:17:08.560 line:95%,end
Saved by the bell.
I didn't even get my tough questions.

00:17:10.195 --> 00:17:11.930 line:95%,end
Okay, it was great meeting you.
Thank you.

00:17:11.997 --> 00:17:13.265 line:95%,end
- KELLY: Abby...
- Thank you.

00:17:13.332 --> 00:17:15.868 line:95%,end
Watch and see if he's pigeon-toed
when he walks away.

00:17:15.934 --> 00:17:19.171 line:5%,start
This would be great if Abby finds love,

00:17:19.238 --> 00:17:21.573 line:95%,end
because it would make me the hero,

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.610 line:95%,end
and it would make all of our lives
a whole lot easier.

00:17:24.676 --> 00:17:26.578 line:95%,end
Don't fall in love with anyone else.

00:17:26.645 --> 00:17:28.647 line:95%,end
Well, hey, you know...?

00:17:28.714 --> 00:17:30.983 line:95%,end
You're only as good
as your last performance.

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:33.052 line:95%,end
- How you doing?
- How<i> you </i>doing?

00:17:33.118 --> 00:17:35.020 line:5%,start
- I'm Darryl.
- Nice to meet you.

00:17:35.087 --> 00:17:37.523 line:95%,end
- DARRYL: Me, too.
- I've never dated a man of color.

00:17:37.589 --> 00:17:38.724 line:95%,end
- Oh, for real?
- No.

00:17:38.791 --> 00:17:40.092 line:95%,end
Well, you know what they say, don't you?

00:17:40.159 --> 00:17:43.862 line:95%,end
- So, so, what is the question?
- I could... I could... I could... Oh!

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:46.398 line:95%,end
- DARRYL: What is the question?
- Were you a jock in high school?

00:17:46.465 --> 00:17:50.135 line:95%,end
- I was a jock, yeah. I...
- Please tell me you played football.

00:17:50.202 --> 00:17:53.205 line:95%,end
I played football,
I played basketball, I played baseball.

00:17:53.272 --> 00:17:54.273 line:95%,end
- I ran track.
- Ah, well...

00:17:55.441 --> 00:17:57.042 line:95%,end
Um... I'm a 50-yard-line kind of girl.

00:17:57.109 --> 00:17:58.577 line:95%,end
- Oh, are you?
- Yes, I am.

00:17:58.644 --> 00:18:00.279 line:95%,end
Cool. Were you a cheerleader?

00:18:00.345 --> 00:18:02.081 line:95%,end
- No.
- You weren't?

00:18:02.147 --> 00:18:04.349 line:95%,end
I just mean, I did it on the 50-yard line.

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:05.984 line:95%,end
Speed dating was fabulous.

00:18:07.152 --> 00:18:09.855 line:95%,end
It was like
I was auditioning men for a date.

00:18:09.922 --> 00:18:13.992 line:95%,end
I got to sit back on the casting couch
and just say, "next... next..."

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:18.697 line:95%,end
Jill, I think this was a gift
that's going to keep on giving.


00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:24.503 line:5%,start
So, here's what we're going to do.
I want to start with the duet today.

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:26.338 line:95%,end
Can we just mark through it once?

00:18:27.139 --> 00:18:29.908 line:5%,start
Five, six, seven, eight, one, two...

00:18:29.975 --> 00:18:33.011 line:95%,end
Your foot needs to point
when it pulls off the floor-- point it.

00:18:33.078 --> 00:18:37.516 line:5%,start
Nia and Kendall are in the studio
learning their duet, "Dig It."

00:18:37.749 --> 00:18:40.052 line:95%,end
<i>And the choreography is difficult.</i>

00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:43.355 line:95%,end
They both move a little too slow
for my liking.

00:18:44.223 --> 00:18:48.093 line:95%,end
Now, Jill--
she wants Kendall to be a superstar.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.662 line:95%,end
Jill, pay attention,

00:18:50.729 --> 00:18:53.999 line:95%,end
because nobody's going
to be digging this routine.

00:18:54.066 --> 00:18:55.734 line:95%,end
We have today. This is it, girls.

00:18:56.268 --> 00:18:57.536 line:95%,end
It's now or never.

00:18:57.903 --> 00:19:01.440 line:95%,end
We're going to get on that bus
and go to Bernardsville, New Jersey today.

00:19:02.107 --> 00:19:04.643 line:95%,end
It's a duet.
You have to dance together as one.

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:08.380 line:95%,end
Do it again.
One, two, turn, turn, hit.

00:19:08.447 --> 00:19:11.717 line:95%,end
Face, Nia, face.
Practice the facial expressions.

00:19:11.783 --> 00:19:13.385 line:95%,end
Fix your hat.

00:19:15.387 --> 00:19:17.789 line:95%,end
Nia, you missed the turns again.
You were late.

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:20.025 line:95%,end
You need to work on it.

00:19:20.292 --> 00:19:21.727 line:95%,end
Send Maddie in, please.

00:19:22.494 --> 00:19:24.163 line:5%,start
Leg up, up, up.

00:19:24.229 --> 00:19:26.732 line:5%,start
You need to work
on your forced arch relevÃ©.

00:19:26.798 --> 00:19:28.700 line:95%,end
Get out of that corner;
keep your legs together.

00:19:28.767 --> 00:19:30.736 line:95%,end
Squeeze them. Like that step.

00:19:30.802 --> 00:19:32.738 line:95%,end
You need to fly through the air.

00:19:33.472 --> 00:19:36.575 line:95%,end
Go... Yes... Okay.

00:19:36.642 --> 00:19:38.477 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: So, how was Abby
in there with Nia?

00:19:38.544 --> 00:19:39.978 line:95%,end
She's not just picking on Nia, right?

00:19:40.045 --> 00:19:42.414 line:95%,end
- I think she is just picking on Nia.
- It's rotten.

00:19:43.182 --> 00:19:45.751 line:5%,start
This week, Nia and Kendall have a duet,

00:19:45.817 --> 00:19:48.787 line:95%,end
and all I can think is, you know,
"Look out, Holly, 'cause Jill's coming."

00:19:48.854 --> 00:19:52.157 line:95%,end
She wants Kendall to shine
and be special in the duet.

00:19:52.524 --> 00:19:54.693 line:95%,end
Here, I'm going to...
I need to go down and check...

00:20:01.733 --> 00:20:03.101 line:95%,end
- Hey, G.
- Hi.

00:20:03.168 --> 00:20:06.538 line:95%,end
- Hey, do you have some time right now?
- Yeah.

00:20:06.605 --> 00:20:07.673 line:95%,end
- Are you busy?
- No.

00:20:07.739 --> 00:20:10.242 line:95%,end
- To maybe work with Kendall?
- I'm on break right now.

00:20:10.309 --> 00:20:11.376 line:95%,end
Oh.

00:20:11.443 --> 00:20:13.278 line:95%,end
- Just in Studio B?
- Yeah, like-like kind of private...

00:20:13.345 --> 00:20:15.214 line:95%,end
I want to work on the duet with her.

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:16.882 line:95%,end
- Yeah, you'd do that for me?
- For sure.

00:20:16.949 --> 00:20:17.950 line:95%,end
- Okay.
- Yeah.

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:21.720 line:5%,start
This private that
Kendall is having with Gia

00:20:21.787 --> 00:20:23.789 line:5%,start
is about Kendall's personal growth.

00:20:24.456 --> 00:20:27.492 line:95%,end
<i>Really, if Kendall can get</i>
<i>a little extra help</i>

00:20:27.559 --> 00:20:30.462 line:95%,end
to be the best she can be,
I'll-I'll take it.

00:20:31.263 --> 00:20:34.566 line:95%,end
Oh, look, there's Jill. I found her.

00:20:34.633 --> 00:20:35.667 line:95%,end
What's she doing?

00:20:35.734 --> 00:20:38.270 line:95%,end
- Uh, having a private with Kendall.
- For what?

00:20:38.337 --> 00:20:41.206 line:95%,end
To make sure that
she's the superstar of the duet.

00:20:41.273 --> 00:20:43.542 line:95%,end
- Oh, you're kidding me.
- Now, why wouldn't Nia be in there?

00:20:43.609 --> 00:20:46.211 line:95%,end
- Isn't this... isn't a duet two people?
- Two people?

00:20:46.278 --> 00:20:48.814 line:5%,start
HOLLY: Jill approaches life
as a competition,

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:52.050 line:5%,start
and she sees Chloe
being on the outs with Abby

00:20:52.117 --> 00:20:53.919 line:95%,end
as being an advantage for Kendall.

00:20:53.986 --> 00:20:55.787 line:95%,end
- Come on, Holly. I'll go with...
- HOLLY: Okay, okay.

00:20:59.358 --> 00:21:00.759 line:95%,end
(mouthing)


00:21:00.826 --> 00:21:03.629 line:95%,end
- Come over here for a second.
- Hey, what's going on?

00:21:03.695 --> 00:21:08.800 line:95%,end
I have to say, I was a little surprised
to see that Kendall was in a private.

00:21:08.867 --> 00:21:11.670 line:95%,end
I don't know if it's considered a private,
but I came out and asked Gia.

00:21:11.737 --> 00:21:15.140 line:95%,end
Said, "Is there anything
she needs to work on individually?"

00:21:15.874 --> 00:21:18.677 line:95%,end
- Why?
- Why? Because it's a duet...

00:21:18.744 --> 00:21:22.614 line:95%,end
Or is this just an opportunity,
to, like, get Kendall up that pyramid?

00:21:22.681 --> 00:21:25.984 line:95%,end
It is a way for her
to stand out more than Nia.

00:21:26.051 --> 00:21:29.254 line:95%,end
You know, I have to do
what's best for Kendall and me.

00:21:29.321 --> 00:21:31.423 line:5%,start
Jill is the definition of a stage mom.

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:33.592 line:5%,start
You know, instead of putting
Kendall's photo on that pyramid,

00:21:33.659 --> 00:21:35.927 line:95%,end
I think Jill would be better off
with her headshot.

00:21:36.228 --> 00:21:38.964 line:95%,end
All right, I want to give
these costumes out to everybody.

00:21:39.031 --> 00:21:40.265 line:95%,end
- Kendall.
- Thank you.

00:21:40.332 --> 00:21:41.733 line:95%,end
Maddie, Paige.

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.735 line:95%,end
- We do this with her?
- Maybe.

00:21:43.802 --> 00:21:45.537 line:95%,end
Now, to set this routine up,

00:21:45.604 --> 00:21:48.607 line:95%,end
the peasant girl has befriended you,

00:21:48.674 --> 00:21:51.376 line:95%,end
and you promised
to take care of her daughter

00:21:51.443 --> 00:21:52.778 line:95%,end
on her dying day.

00:21:52.844 --> 00:21:56.581 line:95%,end
So, girls, this is a very romantic,
epic love story.

00:21:56.648 --> 00:21:59.584 line:95%,end
I don't know--
think of me and my last date.

00:21:59.651 --> 00:22:00.652 line:95%,end
Oh, my.

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:03.422 line:95%,end
I was in LA,

00:22:03.488 --> 00:22:06.625 line:95%,end
and we get very teary,
'cause we're 3,000 miles apart.

00:22:06.692 --> 00:22:08.160 line:95%,end
(laughter)

00:22:08.226 --> 00:22:09.695 line:95%,end
And he doesn't want to come here.

00:22:10.662 --> 00:22:12.297 line:95%,end
NICK: Why not?
PAIGE: I don't blame him.

00:22:12.431 --> 00:22:16.134 line:95%,end
Well, she's got a guy in LA,
you know, but he's, you know...

00:22:16.201 --> 00:22:17.402 line:95%,end
He's gay.

00:22:18.503 --> 00:22:20.205 line:95%,end
I don't think she thinks he is.

00:22:22.274 --> 00:22:24.009 line:95%,end
I'm not pretty sure. I'm positive.

00:22:25.577 --> 00:22:26.745 line:95%,end
Um...

00:22:29.147 --> 00:22:30.816 line:5%,start
(laughter)

00:22:30.882 --> 00:22:35.587 line:95%,end
But why would you be excited
to be engaged to a gay man?

00:22:35.987 --> 00:22:37.589 line:95%,end
It could be a friendship one.

00:22:37.656 --> 00:22:39.891 line:95%,end
- Or a beard.
- JILL: Hmm...

00:22:41.093 --> 00:22:44.596 line:95%,end
So, last night, your mothers claimed
that they were taking me out to dinner.

00:22:44.663 --> 00:22:48.533 line:95%,end
They took me to a speed dating program.

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:49.935 line:95%,end
(laughter)

00:22:50.635 --> 00:22:54.039 line:95%,end
You sit down, and you talk
to somebody for five minutes,

00:22:54.106 --> 00:22:56.608 line:95%,end
and then they ring a bell,
and then you switch people.

00:22:56.675 --> 00:22:58.610 line:95%,end
And you switch people,
and you switch people.

00:22:58.677 --> 00:23:01.079 line:95%,end
I wonder if she called any of the men.

00:23:01.146 --> 00:23:03.181 line:95%,end
She was probably on the phone
with them all night.

00:23:03.248 --> 00:23:05.751 line:95%,end
Now she went
from speed dating to phone sex.

00:23:05.817 --> 00:23:06.952 line:95%,end
(screeches)

00:23:07.219 --> 00:23:08.787 line:95%,end
And let's take the dance from the top.

00:23:09.054 --> 00:23:12.257 line:5%,start
Okay, let's go. It's all about the skirts,
not about learning the number.

00:23:12.524 --> 00:23:13.658 line:95%,end
We're doing a love theme.

00:23:13.725 --> 00:23:17.763 line:95%,end
It should be beautiful
and poetic and fluid.

when you're young-- the white dress.

00:23:22.367 --> 00:23:24.603 line:95%,end
And after you get married,
you always dream of the black one.

00:23:24.669 --> 00:23:26.638 line:95%,end
(laughing) The perfect black dress.

00:23:26.705 --> 00:23:28.373 line:95%,end
No, no, I'm talking about the funeral.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:29.574 line:95%,end
- Oh.
- Oh!

00:23:29.641 --> 00:23:31.343 line:95%,end
You think I'm a widow.

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:34.679 line:95%,end
We're going to New Jersey.
You know what happens to us in New Jersey.

00:23:34.746 --> 00:23:35.947 line:95%,end
It's not good.

- How are you?

00:23:49.961 --> 00:23:51.696 line:95%,end
Good, good, good.

However, I don't want
to make a big deal about it,

Maddie knows the duet.

But I couldn't do that to Nia.

I'd rather do it as a solo.

Just letting you know.

00:25:38.203 --> 00:25:40.505 line:95%,end
Nothing. Abby's worried about Nia's cough.

in here about it?

No.

not me-- tell Miss Abby,
and we'll do it another time, right?

if she's gonna go on stage,

00:26:13.505 --> 00:26:16.575 line:95%,end
she cannot use her illness as a cop-out

00:26:16.641 --> 00:26:18.476 line:95%,end

Okay, I'll go find look...
find her in the bathroom.

Yeah, I guess you didn't expect
to see<i> me </i>out here, huh?

- I would love her to.
- Yeah?

00:29:08.747 --> 00:29:09.848 line:95%,end
Absolutely. Wait, do the turn, though.

00:29:09.914 --> 00:29:11.649 line:95%,end
- Let me go grab her before...
- Okay, okay.

00:29:11.716 --> 00:29:14.552 line:95%,end
I'm gonna go get Nia. I don't want her
to miss out on this special lesson.

00:29:14.619 --> 00:29:15.854 line:95%,end
HOLLY: I'm frustrated,

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:19.190 line:95%,end
but even more than frustrated and angry,
I'm disappointed.

00:29:19.257 --> 00:29:24.062 line:95%,end
I just talked to Jill yesterday
about having privates with teachers.

00:29:24.129 --> 00:29:26.364 line:95%,end
I just don't understand why she does this.

00:29:26.431 --> 00:29:29.434 line:95%,end
She's a piece of work.
Nia, come on outside.

00:29:29.501 --> 00:29:31.436 line:95%,end
We're just reviewing a dance.
Put on some shoes.

00:29:31.503 --> 00:29:34.072 line:95%,end
- CHRISTI: What's she doing?
- Gianna's working with Kendall.

00:29:34.139 --> 00:29:35.940 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: What?! Gianna is?

00:29:36.007 --> 00:29:38.676 line:95%,end
Yeah. She just grabbed her.
Gianna happened to be out in the hallway.

00:29:38.743 --> 00:29:41.079 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: You know what, Holly?
That's not Gianna.

00:29:41.146 --> 00:29:42.280 line:95%,end
- That's Jill.
- No, that's Jill.

00:29:42.347 --> 00:29:45.383 line:95%,end
That's Jill, just being pushy,
and trying to get ahead.

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:48.153 line:95%,end
HOLLY:<i> I'm really not so upset</i>
<i>with Gianna, because, as a teacher,</i>

00:29:48.219 --> 00:29:51.222 line:95%,end
if a parent will ask you for help,
I get it.

00:29:51.289 --> 00:29:54.492 line:95%,end
More so, I'm upset with Jill
for putting Gianna in the middle of that.

00:29:54.559 --> 00:29:55.794 line:95%,end
It was inappropriate.

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:59.164 line:95%,end
You weren't supposed
to have Gianna work with her.

00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:01.232 line:95%,end
It was, like, a little private.

00:30:01.299 --> 00:30:02.734 line:95%,end
- Again.
- I went to the bathroom.

00:30:02.801 --> 00:30:03.802 line:95%,end
- Where's the bathroom?
- I came here...

00:30:03.868 --> 00:30:05.170 line:95%,end
Wait, let me tell you.
It's around the corner.

00:30:05.236 --> 00:30:06.805 line:95%,end
JILL: Kendall st...
I said, "Oh, why don't you...

00:30:06.871 --> 00:30:08.039 line:95%,end
here's a big space, why don't you..."

00:30:08.106 --> 00:30:11.643 line:95%,end
You should've been in there and said,
"Holly, guess what! Gia's out here."

00:30:11.709 --> 00:30:13.478 line:95%,end
We were just saying,
"Where's Gia? Where's Gia?"

00:30:13.545 --> 00:30:14.746 line:95%,end
We had just said that in there,

00:30:14.813 --> 00:30:16.214 line:95%,end
"She should be
working with the girls, we need her help."

00:30:16.281 --> 00:30:17.415 line:95%,end
She should be working with the girls.

00:30:17.482 --> 00:30:19.717 line:95%,end
- Girls. Girls, plural.
- Right. Right. Holly, please.

00:30:19.918 --> 00:30:21.986 line:5%,start
It's not a private,
because I'm not paying for it.

00:30:22.053 --> 00:30:23.621 line:5%,start
I didn't schedule it.

00:30:23.688 --> 00:30:25.690 line:95%,end
It lasted about three minutes long.

00:30:25.757 --> 00:30:29.127 line:95%,end
<i>This is the job of a dance instructor.</i>

00:30:29.194 --> 00:30:31.596 line:95%,end
I didn't realize
that was considered a private.

00:30:31.663 --> 00:30:34.032 line:95%,end
- But it upset Holly, so I can't...
- Wow.

00:30:34.098 --> 00:30:35.834 line:95%,end
- ...can't do it anymore.
- Why?

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:38.002 line:95%,end
Because I don't want everybody
to be upset with me...

00:30:38.069 --> 00:30:40.271 line:95%,end
Oh, so you're gonna be like Melissa.

00:30:40.338 --> 00:30:41.940 line:95%,end
- JILL: ...as good as she can be.
- Right.

00:30:42.006 --> 00:30:43.074 line:95%,end
So you need to decide--

00:30:43.141 --> 00:30:45.210 line:95%,end
do you want the mothers
to not be upset with you,

00:30:45.276 --> 00:30:46.711 line:95%,end
or do you want your kid to get better?

00:30:46.778 --> 00:30:48.580 line:95%,end
I can't have them angry at me.

00:30:48.646 --> 00:30:50.481 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: Why are the other moms
in the group...

00:30:50.548 --> 00:30:51.950 line:95%,end
Because we<i> are </i>a team.

00:30:52.016 --> 00:30:53.685 line:95%,end
...more important than your own child?

00:30:53.751 --> 00:30:55.286 line:95%,end
JILL: They're not. Obviously, they're not.

00:30:55.353 --> 00:30:57.755 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: Then you shouldn't...
give a darn what Holly cares.

00:30:57.822 --> 00:30:59.324 line:95%,end
Nia, how you feeling?

00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:00.825 line:95%,end
- Good.
- Really?

00:31:00.892 --> 00:31:03.361 line:95%,end
All right. Deep breaths.

I think she has this whole thing sewn up.

CHRISTI: Yeah, see, Jill,
all that extra help paid off.

00:33:51.362 --> 00:33:53.498 line:95%,end
It sure did. I thought they looked great.

00:33:53.564 --> 00:33:55.833 line:95%,end
But you know what, Holly,
I thought Nia was fabulous in the duet,

00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:57.368 line:95%,end
and you didn't even need
all the extra help.

00:33:57.435 --> 00:33:59.971 line:95%,end
Abby can't make up her mind
to save her life.

00:34:00.038 --> 00:34:02.206 line:95%,end
I know. She...
And she changes h-her mind.

00:34:02.273 --> 00:34:04.976 line:95%,end
Like, she'll say one thing and then
it's like, "I don't like this" and then...

00:34:05.043 --> 00:34:06.978 line:95%,end
Kind of like
when I got in the limo, you know?

00:34:07.045 --> 00:34:09.414 line:95%,end
"Let's all go," and then Jill's like,
"Nope, get out."

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:12.283 line:95%,end
That was humiliating.
Were you setting me up to be humiliated?

JILL: Me? No.

00:34:14.185 --> 00:34:17.722 line:95%,end
There were four other people
involved in that. Why am I the fall guy?

00:34:17.989 --> 00:34:22.026 line:95%,end
As I was informed, Jill will do anything
to move Kendall up that spot.

And if that means taking Abby on a date...

00:34:23.795 --> 00:34:26.664 line:95%,end
We brought me back in,
and we did this standoff

00:34:26.731 --> 00:34:30.034 line:95%,end
at the beginning of the year to be a team.

00:34:30.101 --> 00:34:31.803 line:95%,end
And I don't feel like...

00:34:31.869 --> 00:34:34.072 line:95%,end
doing this stuff behind each other's back,

00:34:34.138 --> 00:34:35.907 line:95%,end
I don't feel like we're being a team.

00:34:35.973 --> 00:34:37.408 line:95%,end
I didn't do anything behind your back.

00:34:37.475 --> 00:34:40.645 line:95%,end
I did it right in front of you,
and I did it to benefit my child.

00:34:40.711 --> 00:34:42.713 line:95%,end
At least you're honest.
I'd rather somebody say,

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:44.148 line:95%,end
"You know what,
I'm gonna do everything I can,"

00:34:44.215 --> 00:34:45.683 line:95%,end

So whatever.

Mackenzie gets second place.
I'm proud of her.

00:37:43.327 --> 00:37:46.097 line:95%,end
There was a lot of competition
in her division.

00:37:46.163 --> 00:37:50.034 line:95%,end

ABBY LEE:<i> It's like somebody</i>

00:38:16.294 --> 00:38:19.163 line:95%,end
<i>She is the one kid</i>
<i>that I can count on winning.</i>

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:21.999 line:95%,end
That just goes to prove you don't put
all your eggs in one basket.

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:27.338 line:95%,end
Now moving into our elite
junior duet/trio division.

<i>there are certain elements</i>
<i>that you need in the number,</i>

00:38:40.184 --> 00:38:44.789 line:5%,start
and this duet wasn't really choreographed
to be a "winning number."

00:38:44.855 --> 00:38:48.926 line:95%,end
All right, now we're gonna go back

ABBY LEE:<i> I'll tell you what,</i>
<i>I loved this number.</i>

00:39:13.117 --> 00:39:15.186 line:95%,end
And I loved this dance competition.

00:39:16.053 --> 00:39:19.657 line:95%,end
But I don't love the fact
that they were second.

00:39:19.724 --> 00:39:21.492 line:95%,end
That's the biggest loser on the stage.

00:39:21.559 --> 00:39:24.729 line:95%,end
Aw, I felt so bad for the group.
I mean, I... (sighs)

00:39:24.795 --> 00:39:27.965 line:95%,end
I think the love fest is ending.
It was quite a lovey-dovey week.

00:39:28.032 --> 00:39:30.534 line:95%,end
- The love fest is over.
- It's over.

00:39:30.601 --> 00:39:32.103 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Hi!

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:35.406 line:95%,end

MELISSA: Hey, it's okay.

00:39:36.974 --> 00:39:38.809 line:95%,end
Good job. I'm proud of you guys.

00:39:38.876 --> 00:39:40.277 line:95%,end
I thought you guys were amazing.

00:39:40.578 --> 00:39:42.480 line:95%,end
We can hope for better next time, right?

00:39:43.114 --> 00:39:44.281 line:95%,end
I... uh...

00:39:48.652 --> 00:39:50.054 line:95%,end
Well, well, well.

00:39:50.554 --> 00:39:52.022 line:95%,end
They were beautiful.

00:39:54.325 --> 00:39:58.329 line:95%,end
Ladies... I think
some of you need a break.

00:39:58.396 --> 00:40:01.832 line:95%,end
Kendall, did your private
with Gianna help in the duet?

00:40:01.899 --> 00:40:04.068 line:95%,end
I think you two have a big hole
to dig yourselves out of.

00:40:04.835 --> 00:40:07.371 line:95%,end
Maddie, what happened?
You were on top of the pyramid.

00:40:07.438 --> 00:40:09.073 line:95%,end
I threw you the "Lifeline..."

00:40:09.907 --> 00:40:12.610 line:95%,end
you let it slip right out of your hands.
You were that close.

00:40:12.676 --> 00:40:15.813 line:95%,end
And, Mackenzie,
I firmly believe, like Maddie,

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.782 line:95%,end
you need to get knocked down a peg.

00:40:17.848 --> 00:40:19.450 line:95%,end
'Cause that's gonna make you work harder.

00:40:19.517 --> 00:40:21.452 line:95%,end
And this was a love story,

00:40:21.519 --> 00:40:25.389 line:95%,end
and the one lesson
I thought all of you would take home

00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:27.258 line:95%,end
was that you love to dance.

00:40:27.324 --> 00:40:30.060 line:95%,end
<i>They need to figure out,</i>
<i>do they love to dance?</i>

00:40:30.127 --> 00:40:32.329 line:95%,end
<i>Do they love to compete</i>
<i>and do they love to win?</i>

00:40:32.396 --> 00:40:34.031 line:95%,end
<i>Do they want this to be a career?</i>

00:40:34.398 --> 00:40:36.867 line:95%,end
Because if you don't, move aside.

00:40:37.268 --> 00:40:39.403 line:95%,end
You know what, ladies?
I don't want to be nasty,

00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:41.038 line:95%,end
but it's tough love sometimes.

00:40:41.105 --> 00:40:44.408 line:95%,end
I love you kids.
I do. I love all my students.

00:40:44.475 --> 00:40:46.277 line:95%,end
But I don't love what happened
out there today.

00:40:52.883 --> 00:40:56.620 line:95%,end
The name of the group routine
is Don't Ask, Just Tell.

00:40:56.854 --> 00:40:58.923 line:95%,end
If you wanna be Maddie,
then you need to get the face.

00:40:58.989 --> 00:41:00.324 line:95%,end
That's it. Good, good, good.

00:41:00.391 --> 00:41:01.492 line:5%,start
- Who is it?
- Some guy.

00:41:01.792 --> 00:41:03.160 line:5%,start
- Hello?
- You can have the first bite.

00:41:04.662 --> 00:41:07.264 line:5%,start
You hurt your foot? Then you
shouldn't be on it. Go home.

00:41:07.465 --> 00:41:10.468 line:5%,start
- Miss Abby wasn't yelling at you.
- (indistinct)

00:41:10.668 --> 00:41:12.102 line:5%,start
Oh, honey, I know you don't.

00:41:12.169 --> 00:41:14.572 line:5%,start
She is throwing her talent away.

00:41:14.638 --> 00:41:17.174 line:5%,start
It's time to not be dancing anymore.

00:41:17.475 --> 00:41:19.477 line:5%,start
Pay attention to your child, not mine.

00:41:19.844 --> 00:41:21.879 line:5%,start
Mackenzie. I don't wanna be lied to.

00:41:21.946 --> 00:41:23.180 line:5%,start
If you can dance, you dance.

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:26.317 line:5%,start
Did you witness Mackenzie
doing cartwheels in here?

00:41:26.383 --> 00:41:28.085 line:5%,start
I ask you a question!

00:41:28.586 --> 00:41:29.987 line:5%,start
Don't you lie to me.
