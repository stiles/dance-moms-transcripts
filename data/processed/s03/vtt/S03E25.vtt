ABBY: Previously, on "Dance Moms"--

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:04.204 line:5%,start
CATHY: We're starting a new ballgame.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.241 line:5%,start
This is our opportunity
to build and get strong.

00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:09.809 line:5%,start
We just want to take a look at the space.

00:00:09.876 --> 00:00:12.679 line:5%,start
Oh, my goodness, this is the next stop.

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:14.080 line:5%,start
WOMAN: On lunge again.

00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:16.649 line:5%,start
Two arms up in high fifth.

00:00:16.716 --> 00:00:18.151 line:5%,start
Shoulders down.

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.755 line:5%,start
CATHY: Well, Anthony,
show myself what you've got to offer.

00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:23.056 line:5%,start
Oh, [beep].

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:24.691 line:5%,start
Put your mouth on vacation.

00:00:24.758 --> 00:00:26.426 line:5%,start
You told my daughter--

00:00:26.493 --> 00:00:28.495 line:5%,start
[interposing voices]

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:31.297 line:5%,start

ABBY: Coming up on "Dance Moms"--

00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:35.935 line:5%,start
ABBY: Maddie's doing a solo
at "Abby's Ultimate Dance Competition."

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:38.471 line:5%,start
You want to go to dinner tonight,
you better get it together.

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:40.440 line:5%,start
DONNA: Jalen's going to go against Mari.

00:00:40.507 --> 00:00:42.108 line:5%,start
RICK: Jalen will beat Mari hands down.

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:45.045 line:5%,start
ANTHONY: You can't find your legs.
Plie.

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.983 line:5%,start
ANNOUNCER: From "Dance Moms,"
Maddie of The Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.518 line:5%,start
[cheers and applause]

00:00:51.584 --> 00:00:54.387 line:5%,start
ANTHONY: I really don't understand
why you're so dysfunctional.

00:00:54.454 --> 00:00:56.456 line:5%,start
CATHY: Because you have called me a joke.

00:00:56.523 --> 00:00:57.657 line:5%,start
[suspenseful music]

00:00:57.724 --> 00:01:01.628 line:5%,start
My gosh, are you crying? She's crying.
I'm not going to put up with that.

00:01:01.694 --> 00:01:05.665 line:5%,start
Ideally, I want a team of five.
You can do the math.

[THEME - NIKKO LOWE, "LIVING ON
THE DANCE FLOOR"]

00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:12.272 line:95%,end
(SINGING) Get up, get on the floor.

00:01:12.338 --> 00:01:15.341 line:95%,end
My world is with my girls.

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:17.610 line:95%,end
Living on the dance floor!

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:20.146 line:95%,end
[suspenseful music]

00:01:20.213 --> 00:01:22.248 line:5%,start
ABBY: I'm in sunny California,

00:01:22.315 --> 00:01:26.619 line:5%,start
shooting the second season
of "Abby's Ultimate Dance Competition."

00:01:26.686 --> 00:01:28.788 line:5%,start
And we want somebody
to perform on the show.

00:01:28.855 --> 00:01:34.294 line:95%,end
Of course, Maddie jumped at the
opportunity to come out to LA and perform.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.795 line:95%,end
5, 6--

00:01:37.063 --> 00:01:39.732 line:95%,end
They'll give you a tick, tick, tick,
and then you go.

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.502 line:95%,end
And you're going to go
and look up at that like-- sh.

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:43.803 line:95%,end
Right. Ready?

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.004 line:95%,end
(SINGING) Oh.

00:01:45.071 --> 00:01:47.040 line:95%,end
ABBY: Maddie lives for dance.

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:49.676 line:95%,end
She loves it. She's all about it.

00:01:49.742 --> 00:01:52.378 line:95%,end
Hey, did the other kids want to come?

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:53.847 line:95%,end
I guess not.

00:01:53.913 --> 00:01:56.082 line:95%,end
I think Maddie was definitely
the smart one--

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.352 line:95%,end
getting to meet new people,
getting to see these incredible dancers

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:02.021 line:95%,end
from around the country, and networking.

00:02:02.088 --> 00:02:07.660 line:95%,end
In every job situation, it's not always
what you know, but who you know.

00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:10.997 line:95%,end
Take your time.
It's okay, you can be after the music.

00:02:11.064 --> 00:02:13.199 line:95%,end
You can be after the music.

00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:15.001 line:95%,end
Nice.

00:02:15.068 --> 00:02:18.938 line:95%,end
While I'm busy in Hollywood
with my own TV show,

00:02:19.005 --> 00:02:23.076 line:95%,end
Cathy is back in Ohio,
doing Lord knows what.

00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:25.545 line:95%,end
She tried to have an all-boys team.

00:02:25.612 --> 00:02:28.715 line:95%,end
Did it work? Mm.

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:34.053 line:95%,end
Cathy, there's only one me,
and you're never going to catch me.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.890 line:95%,end
You've got to have the sucker down, okay?

00:02:36.956 --> 00:02:38.992 line:95%,end
So let's try not to do too much playing.

00:02:39.058 --> 00:02:42.562 line:95%,end
Let's do-- let's dance
and make everybody look bad.

00:02:44.597 --> 00:02:47.600 line:5%,start
[music playing]

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.304 line:5%,start
CATHY: How is everybody?
ALL: Good.

00:02:51.371 --> 00:02:55.808 line:5%,start
I really want Candy Apples
to be a household name.

00:02:55.875 --> 00:02:59.179 line:95%,end
And I want Candy Apples
to be professional dancers.

00:02:59.245 --> 00:03:01.581 line:95%,end
I didn't cut anybody last week,

00:03:01.648 --> 00:03:06.553 line:95%,end
but I only want the best dancers
for the Candy Apple Core.

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:08.655 line:95%,end
Not everybody's safe this week.

00:03:08.721 --> 00:03:12.292 line:95%,end
Anthony, it looks like
he's got a book of notes.

00:03:12.358 --> 00:03:17.730 line:95%,end
I have made no bones in letting
him know what our roles are--

00:03:17.797 --> 00:03:20.233 line:95%,end
owner of the dance studio, employer.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.002 line:95%,end
Choreographer, employee.

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:25.672 line:95%,end
So here we are again, pyramid time.

00:03:25.738 --> 00:03:28.107 line:95%,end
I am losing that pyramid.

00:03:28.174 --> 00:03:31.611 line:95%,end
And I am introducing the Apple Tree.

00:03:33.112 --> 00:03:35.381 line:95%,end
Oh, look at that.

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:40.920 line:95%,end
We're going to start at the top
of the tree. We have Nick.

00:03:42.755 --> 00:03:47.527 line:95%,end
Obviously, no questions there
from the peanut gallery.

00:03:47.594 --> 00:03:50.363 line:95%,end
Nick, you were the man of the competition.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.433 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:56.069 line:95%,end
[cheers and applause]


00:03:57.036 --> 00:03:59.372 line:95%,end
You were stupendous.

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:01.774 line:5%,start
DONNA: Cathy has a little
connection with Nick.

00:04:01.841 --> 00:04:06.045 line:5%,start
Nick's put a lot of time into this,
working hard with Anthony and Cathy.

00:04:06.112 --> 00:04:09.949 line:95%,end
And he deserves to get some special parts,
get some solos.

00:04:10.016 --> 00:04:13.286 line:95%,end
Nick should be Cathy's leading man.

00:04:14.287 --> 00:04:17.690 line:95%,end
The next stunning Apple, it is Hadley.

00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:19.826 line:95%,end
[clapping]

00:04:19.892 --> 00:04:21.461 line:95%,end
YVETTE: I was hoping Hadley
would be on the top.

00:04:21.527 --> 00:04:25.398 line:95%,end
She's a very advanced dancer
at the age of 12.

00:04:25.465 --> 00:04:29.802 line:95%,end
When Cathy called to invite Hadley
to her team, I was thrilled.

00:04:29.869 --> 00:04:33.139 line:95%,end
Versus Abby Lee Miller, she
doesn't care about anything but winning,

00:04:33.206 --> 00:04:37.010 line:95%,end
and if it's even taking a kid down,
it doesn't matter to her.

00:04:37.577 --> 00:04:40.680 line:95%,end
(SINGING) Open up your light tonight.

00:04:40.747 --> 00:04:42.515 line:95%,end
YVETTE: Abby tried to break Hadley.

00:04:42.582 --> 00:04:46.119 line:95%,end
KEVIN: Abby, I'm reading your facial
expression, and you don't seem that happy.

00:04:46.853 --> 00:04:49.789 line:95%,end
ABBY: Should I say roadkill?
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:04:49.856 --> 00:04:51.924 line:95%,end
CATHY: Okay, let's move on.

00:04:51.991 --> 00:04:54.827 line:95%,end
Let's see who's in this Apple position.

00:04:55.995 --> 00:04:57.897 line:95%,end
We have Nicaya on the tree.

00:04:57.964 --> 00:05:01.301 line:95%,end
Even though she's not here,
Nicaya is next on the Apple Tree.

00:05:01.367 --> 00:05:05.238 line:95%,end
She dropped everything last week
to come and represent Candy Apples.

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:07.507 line:95%,end
There's always going to be a spot for her.

00:05:07.573 --> 00:05:10.576 line:95%,end
Next, we have Zack.

00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:14.247 line:95%,end
GINA: I feel like Zack really
is an excellent leading man.

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:17.784 line:95%,end
He's always been a leader.
I mean, that's just who he is.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.687 line:5%,start
I think Cathy is a great mentor.

00:05:20.753 --> 00:05:24.057 line:5%,start
I think she's a great teacher.
And I think she's a great coach.

00:05:25.758 --> 00:05:28.127 line:5%,start
I'm dancing with Candy Apples
because I feel like

00:05:28.194 --> 00:05:29.762 line:5%,start
it's a really positive environment.

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:32.432 line:95%,end
I do want to beat Abby for Cathy.

00:05:32.498 --> 00:05:35.301 line:95%,end
CATHY: Next we have Jalen.

00:05:35.368 --> 00:05:39.339 line:95%,end
RICK: My son Jalen is 11 years old,
a b-boy from Seattle.

00:05:39.405 --> 00:05:43.609 line:5%,start
He's a breakdancer.
He's self-taught for the most part.

00:05:43.676 --> 00:05:46.913 line:95%,end
His background is not really
strong in choreography,

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:49.449 line:95%,end
but what he does, he is amazing at.

00:05:49.515 --> 00:05:52.719 line:95%,end
CATHY: Finally, we've got Mari.

00:05:52.785 --> 00:05:56.589 line:5%,start
GINA D: Mari has one title in Indiana,
Ohio.

00:05:56.656 --> 00:05:59.726 line:95%,end
I want Mari to have the best possible
opportunities in the industry.

00:05:59.792 --> 00:06:02.729 line:95%,end
And I feel that Cathy
is a leader in the industry.

00:06:02.795 --> 00:06:06.199 line:95%,end
And if anybody is going to get
my little girl known, it's Cathy.

00:06:07.133 --> 00:06:10.536 line:95%,end
CATHY: That leaves Campbell.
You didn't do the dance.

00:06:10.603 --> 00:06:13.005 line:95%,end
ALLI: Cathy is looking
for her ultimate dream team.

00:06:13.072 --> 00:06:15.074 line:5%,start
I think that she's going to get a chance
to prove

00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:18.010 line:5%,start
that she's something other than
what they think she is.

00:06:19.579 --> 00:06:22.181 line:5%,start
CAMPBELL: I'm not here just to be friends
with everybody.

00:06:22.248 --> 00:06:23.549 line:5%,start
I'm here because I want to dance.

00:06:23.616 --> 00:06:26.319 line:5%,start
My mom made me for one reason,
one reason, only to dance.

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:31.357 line:95%,end
CATHY: This week, we are going to Masters
of Dance in Columbus, Ohio.

00:06:31.424 --> 00:06:34.727 line:95%,end
We will be doing a group dance.
It's going to be fun.

00:06:34.794 --> 00:06:37.196 line:5%,start
ANTHONY: The dance will be entitled
"So Chic."

00:06:37.263 --> 00:06:40.533 line:5%,start
I don't know what "chic" means.
I really don't.

00:06:40.967 --> 00:06:44.303 line:95%,end
ANTHONY: You know, it's about
over-the-top characters, the Club Kids.

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:47.306 line:95%,end
CATHY: Then we're going to be doing
a duet.

00:06:47.373 --> 00:06:52.512 line:95%,end
And my leading man Nick
and my leading lady Hadley.

00:06:52.578 --> 00:06:53.346 line:95%,end
[cheers and applause]

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:55.982 line:5%,start
HADLEY: Nick and I are
kind of battling each other.

00:06:56.048 --> 00:06:58.618 line:95%,end
He's amazing,
and he really pushes me to do better.

00:06:59.185 --> 00:07:02.922 line:95%,end
Nick and Hadley, the title of your duet
will be "Tribal Affair."

00:07:02.989 --> 00:07:05.958 line:95%,end
It's going to be sort of
a contemporary style this week.

00:07:06.025 --> 00:07:09.562 line:95%,end
CATHY: All right, so that brings us
to our solos.

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:13.065 line:95%,end
Jalen, you've got a solo this week.

00:07:13.132 --> 00:07:15.134 line:95%,end
[cheers and applause]

00:07:16.502 --> 00:07:20.273 line:95%,end
ANTHONY: And Jalen, the title of your
solo will be "One Last Goodbye."

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:24.610 line:95%,end
With that said, I'm gonna give you
a contemporary routine this week.

00:07:24.677 --> 00:07:26.212 line:95%,end
- Yes?
WOMAN: Wow.

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:29.849 line:95%,end
CATHY: Jalen's forte, by far,
is spinning on his head.

00:07:29.916 --> 00:07:33.486 line:95%,end
But I need to see that Jalen
is more than just a b-boy.

00:07:33.553 --> 00:07:38.858 line:95%,end
It's time that he step up
and be an all-around dancer.

00:07:38.925 --> 00:07:41.794 line:95%,end
And we have one other solo to pass out.

00:07:42.628 --> 00:07:45.097 line:95%,end
Mari, you're going to get an opportunity.

00:07:45.164 --> 00:07:47.266 line:95%,end
[cheers and applause]

00:07:47.333 --> 00:07:49.135 line:95%,end
I'm still on the fence about Mari.

00:07:49.202 --> 00:07:50.503 line:95%,end
She was sick last week.

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:55.107 line:95%,end
There is nothing worse
than a dancer full of excuses.


00:07:55.174 --> 00:07:58.544 line:95%,end
ANTHONY: Mari, your solo will be entitled
"Still I Rise."

00:07:58.611 --> 00:08:00.379 line:95%,end
CATHY: I still have to trim the fat.

00:08:00.446 --> 00:08:03.950 line:95%,end
I still would like to tighten up
my team a little bit.

00:08:04.016 --> 00:08:06.152 line:95%,end
Mari and Jalen aren't so safe.

00:08:06.219 --> 00:08:08.087 line:95%,end
Thanks, moms! Thanks, dad!

00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:09.889 line:5%,start
Let's get warmed up, guys.

00:08:13.192 --> 00:08:15.962 line:95%,end
YVETTE: Okay, that was intense.
RICK: It was, definitely was.

00:08:16.028 --> 00:08:19.966 line:95%,end
YVETTE: But I think the whole process
is a test. They're testing all the kids.

00:08:20.032 --> 00:08:21.300 line:95%,end
I don't need a test.

00:08:21.367 --> 00:08:24.504 line:95%,end
I kind of feel bad that Cathy
is going to cut a person.

CATHY: So guys, let's talk about the dance
this week, okay?

00:08:28.674 --> 00:08:30.576 line:5%,start
You guys are Club Kids.

00:08:30.643 --> 00:08:34.847 line:95%,end
It's all about being who you are,
and you expressing yourself.

00:08:34.914 --> 00:08:38.084 line:95%,end
I need to see your interpretation
of this song, okay?

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:40.419 line:95%,end
5, 6, and a 7, and a-- ah.

00:08:40.486 --> 00:08:42.955 line:95%,end
RICK: Come on, J, show them that swag.
There it is.

00:08:43.022 --> 00:08:45.291 line:95%,end
There you go. Hoo!

00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:47.260 line:95%,end
CATHY: This week's dance
is going to be so much fun.

00:08:47.326 --> 00:08:50.963 line:95%,end
It's a hip hop number,
and it's called "So Chic."

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:55.668 line:95%,end
It's about Club Kids who like to go out
in ostentatious clothes,

00:08:55.735 --> 00:08:57.303 line:95%,end
and they just like to go clubbing.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:00.172 line:95%,end
Not only do they have to nail
their choreography,

00:09:00.239 --> 00:09:03.376 line:95%,end
but they're also characters.

00:09:03.442 --> 00:09:06.379 line:95%,end
And that has to come across to the judges.

00:09:06.445 --> 00:09:08.114 line:95%,end
(SINGING) Shut down all red carpet lane.

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:11.050 line:95%,end
ANTHONY: Work that form! Hit it hard!
Hey!

00:09:11.117 --> 00:09:14.587 line:95%,end
GINA D: I'm not making an excuse,
but there is something to be said

00:09:14.654 --> 00:09:17.690 line:95%,end
for when a dancer doesn't
typically dance in bare feet.

00:09:17.757 --> 00:09:22.395 line:95%,end
Mari was kind of given a bad rap. And I
think she got a lot of [beep] for nothing.

00:09:22.461 --> 00:09:26.032 line:95%,end
Cathy is making it clear that she's gonna
take this team of six down to five.

00:09:26.098 --> 00:09:29.001 line:95%,end
I'm a little nervous.
My vote is going to be Mari.

00:09:29.068 --> 00:09:31.671 line:95%,end
RICK: Honestly, I'm really worried
about Jalen this week.

00:09:31.737 --> 00:09:33.239 line:95%,end
GINA D: I'm worried about Mari as well.

00:09:33.306 --> 00:09:35.608 line:95%,end
- Jalen's going to go against Mari.
- Right.

00:09:35.675 --> 00:09:37.577 line:95%,end
RICK: Jalen will beat Mari hands down,
without a doubt.

00:09:37.643 --> 00:09:39.712 line:95%,end
Really? Knock it off.

00:09:39.779 --> 00:09:41.847 line:95%,end
RICK: Don't hate. Don't hate. Don't hate.

00:09:41.914 --> 00:09:43.716 line:95%,end
YVETTE: Rick is stressing out.

00:09:43.783 --> 00:09:48.487 line:95%,end
Rick definitely feels that
this is something brand-new for Jalen.

00:09:48.554 --> 00:09:50.156 line:95%,end
CATHY: Hey, you ready for this?

00:09:50.222 --> 00:09:52.692 line:95%,end
We want to keep you on this team, Jalen,

00:09:52.758 --> 00:09:56.062 line:95%,end
but we need to see you grow
every single week.

00:09:56.128 --> 00:09:59.365 line:95%,end
The fact that Jalen just knows
how to do hip hop

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:01.801 line:95%,end
and has no formal technique,

00:10:01.867 --> 00:10:05.071 line:5%,start
I can't let that ruin the group dances.

00:10:05.137 --> 00:10:07.506 line:5%,start
ANTHONY: I want you to break,
see the ceiling.

00:10:07.573 --> 00:10:10.810 line:5%,start
6, 7, 8, and 1, stop.

00:10:10.876 --> 00:10:12.345 line:95%,end
You've got to just be there.

00:10:12.411 --> 00:10:16.048 line:95%,end
The challenge this week is to get
Jalen to do a triple pirouette.

00:10:16.115 --> 00:10:19.051 line:95%,end
If you can do three spins on your head,
you can do it on one foot.

00:10:19.118 --> 00:10:23.089 line:5%,start
So it's important to get Jalen
to be able to understand his ability.

00:10:23.155 --> 00:10:25.024 line:95%,end
And if Jalen doesn't hit
that triple pirouette,

00:10:25.091 --> 00:10:26.692 line:95%,end
I'm afraid we're going to have to cut him.

00:10:26.759 --> 00:10:28.894 line:95%,end

you're not getting to use

00:10:28.961 --> 00:10:30.963 line:95%,end
any of your tricks this week.

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:33.432 line:95%,end

ANTHONY: Keep your ankles together.

00:10:33.499 --> 00:10:34.867 line:95%,end
Yes.

00:10:35.568 --> 00:10:38.404 line:95%,end
On top of the feet, on top of that releve.
Yes.

DONNA: And we're
going to be here late tonight

00:10:44.076 --> 00:10:45.878 line:95%,end
because he's still working on Jalen,

00:10:45.945 --> 00:10:47.146 line:95%,end
and we haven't even got to Mari yet.

00:10:47.213 --> 00:10:50.750 line:95%,end
I wish he would start Mari's a little bit
just even the intro.

00:10:50.816 --> 00:10:53.886 line:95%,end
Jalen needs the extra coaching
because he's not a contemporary dancer.

00:10:53.953 --> 00:10:54.787 line:95%,end
Mari is.

00:10:54.854 --> 00:10:58.257 line:95%,end
RICK: I need to ask him if I can record
that before he's done with him.

00:10:58.324 --> 00:11:01.260 line:95%,end
GINA D: Oh, no, Rick. What about Mari?

00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:03.262 line:95%,end
RICK: One of the hardest things about
being the only man

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:05.965 line:95%,end
in the "kiss and cry" room is that

00:11:06.032 --> 00:11:10.169 line:95%,end
women have to understand,
we express ourselves differently.

GINA D: I do feel, in some ways,

00:11:16.776 --> 00:11:19.612 line:95%,end
Mari is being almost set up to fail

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:22.548 line:95%,end
because she's not getting
the rehearsal time with Anthony.

00:11:22.615 --> 00:11:24.583 line:95%,end
I know they're in there,
but I think that it's okay for us

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:27.153 line:95%,end
to go in and get you stretched.
So why don't we do that?

00:11:27.653 --> 00:11:29.088 line:95%,end
Stretch.

00:11:29.155 --> 00:11:30.890 line:95%,end

- That way?

00:11:30.956 --> 00:11:32.358 line:95%,end
DONNA: She'd get enough time.

00:11:32.425 --> 00:11:37.296 line:95%,end
If a parent busted in on my rehearsal,
they'd be looking for a new dance studio.

ceramic bunnies, bunnies that are gifts,

Sure, I always like to be a winner,

00:39:19.824 --> 00:39:23.227 line:95%,end

teams out there that might come along

the school, that one, very versatile.
We can't be average.

00:39:43.013 --> 00:39:45.783 line:95%,end
ANTHONY: We may not have
went home with a top overall,

Lots of things that everybody
needs to think about.

00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:03.200 line:95%,end
I was really hoping that
between Jalen and Mari,

00:40:03.267 --> 00:40:05.202 line:95%,end
that we would see a clear-cut winner.

00:40:05.269 --> 00:40:09.707 line:95%,end
I have to cut somebody. But what stinks
is, it appears that my choreographer--

00:40:09.774 --> 00:40:14.011 line:95%,end
who I'm investing a lot in--
could possibly be my big problem.

00:40:14.812 --> 00:40:18.516 line:95%,end
Okay, so here we are again.

00:40:18.582 --> 00:40:20.084 line:95%,end
You coming down to my level, big guy?

00:40:20.151 --> 00:40:23.254 line:95%,end
Is Anthony the Apple that's
going to have to get cut?

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:25.790 line:95%,end
You've got to control yourself,

00:40:25.856 --> 00:40:28.392 line:95%,end
or I don't have any respect
to those people.

00:40:28.459 --> 00:40:33.798 line:95%,end
I have invested time, money,
and my reputation in Anthony.

00:40:33.864 --> 00:40:38.302 line:95%,end
So Anthony, not only do I want them
to do a lot of soul searching,

00:40:38.369 --> 00:40:41.472 line:95%,end
I want you to do some soul searching, too.

00:40:41.539 --> 00:40:44.608 line:95%,end
With the money that I've invested
in Anthony,

00:40:44.675 --> 00:40:47.278 line:95%,end
I could buy some designer handbags.

00:40:47.344 --> 00:40:50.781 line:95%,end
So great choreographer, new Louis?

00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:55.119 line:95%,end

regardless.

Abby, I might get on board.
