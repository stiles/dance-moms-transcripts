NARRATOR: Coming up, juicy gossip--

00:00:03.636 --> 00:00:06.172 line:5%,start
The fan sites are all buzzing
about Abby dating.

00:00:06.239 --> 00:00:07.907 line:5%,start
She has two boyfriends.

00:00:07.974 --> 00:00:09.242 line:5%,start
NARRATOR: --some
out-of-control Dance Moms--

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.845 line:5%,start
You have to put off a tough
front with these bitches.

00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:12.746 line:5%,start
You have to be--

00:00:12.812 --> 00:00:14.748 line:5%,start
NARRATOR: --and smack talkin' super-fans.

00:00:14.814 --> 00:00:16.516 line:5%,start
This is our chance to be dance moms.

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:20.587 line:5%,start
When Christie's in the room, she's very,
like, that's right little girl, dance.

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:23.723 line:5%,start
NARRATOR: Plus, joining us onstage,
our very own Dance Moms divas,

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.392 line:5%,start
Christie and Kelly, are here.

00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:28.995 line:5%,start
- You two had a pretty huge blowout.
- I don't know if she's 100% on my side.

00:00:29.062 --> 00:00:30.997 line:5%,start
NARRATOR: This is Dance Moms Chatter.

00:00:31.064 --> 00:00:32.966 line:5%,start
I never thought I'd be Team Black Patsy,

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:35.568 line:5%,start
but if you're calling her [bleep], Abby,
I might get on board.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.340 line:95%,end
(SINGING) Get up. Get on the floor.

00:00:40.407 --> 00:00:45.979 line:95%,end
My world is with my girls
living on the dance floor.

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:48.048 line:95%,end
[audience cheering]

00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:57.123 line:5%,start
Hi, I'm Jeff Collins.
Welcome to Dance Moms Chatter.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.325 line:95%,end
We've got some cast members here,
we have some comedians

00:00:59.392 --> 00:01:01.161 line:95%,end
who are also super-fans of the show.

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:04.464 line:95%,end
Plus, we've got fan-favorite clips
that I know you're going to want to see.

00:01:04.531 --> 00:01:08.268 line:95%,end
So, it wouldn't be Dance Moms
without some Abby Lee Miller drama.

00:01:08.334 --> 00:01:11.438 line:95%,end
So take a look at this collection of clips
I put together for you.

00:01:11.504 --> 00:01:14.074 line:95%,end
You will not get past this front desk
without these being assigned.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.910 line:95%,end
- Where's Kelly's?
- Kelly called me names.

00:01:16.976 --> 00:01:21.648 line:95%,end
Kelly quit. Kelly boo-hooed,
and her kids are lazy slugs.

00:01:21.714 --> 00:01:25.552 line:95%,end
We're trying to stand behind Brooke
in her decision, and we wondered--

00:01:25.618 --> 00:01:27.587 line:95%,end
Well, I didn't hear any [bleep].

00:01:27.654 --> 00:01:29.322 line:95%,end
Go. There's the door, right there.

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:30.890 line:95%,end
Abby, I wish it were that easy.

00:01:30.957 --> 00:01:33.426 line:95%,end
And if that's really what you want,
then we will.

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:36.429 line:95%,end
- That's not what I want, but--
- I didn't think that's what you wanted.

00:01:36.496 --> 00:01:39.099 line:95%,end
- I don't either.
- Dih-dih-dih-dih-dih-dih-dih-dih!

00:01:39.165 --> 00:01:41.868 line:95%,end
- The other mom's can't--
- Your kid is a brat.

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:44.938 line:95%,end
I'm about this far from falling the duet.

00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:48.541 line:95%,end
No. She needs to do the duet to prove to
you that she is capable of dancing,

00:01:48.608 --> 00:01:49.742 line:95%,end
and dancing well through pain.

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:51.678 line:95%,end
I know, but your mouth is ugly, woman.

00:01:51.744 --> 00:01:53.913 line:95%,end
You are a monstrosity of evil.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.117 line:95%,end
- You want to talk about ugliness.
- You're done. You're done.

00:01:57.183 --> 00:01:58.017 line:95%,end
No duet.

00:01:58.084 --> 00:02:00.153 line:95%,end
What you say goes.
You don't care about the kids.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.389 line:95%,end
You don't care about anybody but yourself.
That's terrible.

00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:07.460 line:95%,end
Why would I be in this business
if I didn't care about their futures?

00:02:07.527 --> 00:02:09.963 line:95%,end
JILL: Well then why don't--
- You're the one that screwed her up.

00:02:11.598 --> 00:02:16.402 line:95%,end
Every opportunity I have given you
came from my heart.

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:18.471 line:95%,end
That was awful, Maddie.

00:02:18.538 --> 00:02:21.007 line:95%,end
I don't deserve that.
I didn't deserve any of it.

00:02:21.074 --> 00:02:24.077 line:95%,end
There's always another kid.
There's always somebody else.

00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:27.213 line:95%,end
We love you.
We were ready to work with you.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.149 line:95%,end
And you sat out there...

00:02:32.886 --> 00:02:34.354 line:95%,end
I'm sorry.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.224 line:95%,end
Why didn't you get out of the car and go,
"No, I'm going in there."

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.294 line:95%,end
Done.

00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:42.595 line:95%,end
[gasp]

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:44.998 line:95%,end
[bleep] you, Abby.

00:02:45.064 --> 00:02:48.201 line:95%,end
You don't need him for the competition.
I told you to do it for today.

00:02:48.868 --> 00:02:51.070 line:95%,end
All right, without conflict
there wouldn't be any show.

00:02:51.137 --> 00:02:54.207 line:95%,end
And these two lovely ladies
know all about conflict.

00:02:54.274 --> 00:02:58.511 line:95%,end
Please welcome fan-favorites
dueling dance moms, Christi and Kelly.

00:02:58.578 --> 00:03:00.580 line:95%,end
[audience cheering]

00:03:09.956 --> 00:03:12.158 line:95%,end
There's been a lot of crazy stuff
that's happened this season.

00:03:12.225 --> 00:03:15.862 line:95%,end
The fan sites are all buzzing,
the blogs are buzzing about Abby dating.

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:20.266 line:5%,start
And we hear, via the fans,
that she has not one boyfriend,

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:23.636 line:95%,end
but two boyfriends.
One boyfriend in each city.

00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:25.939 line:95%,end
No, wait a minute.
What do you consider a boyfriend?

00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:28.408 line:5%,start
- Now, this is not--
- Someone who's willing to talk to her?

00:03:28.474 --> 00:03:31.611 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: I don't know. Is bus driver Jim
considered a boyfriend?

00:03:31.678 --> 00:03:33.713 line:95%,end
I don't know, he takes her out
every Friday night.

00:03:34.113 --> 00:03:35.648 line:95%,end
- Does he really?
- Yes, he does!

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:38.184 line:5%,start
Every Friday night when we travel,

00:03:38.251 --> 00:03:40.386 line:5%,start
when we arrive at our destination


00:03:40.453 --> 00:03:42.689 line:5%,start
he takes her to the movies on the bus.

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.792 line:5%,start
There's been a lot of chatter
about Abby's guy in LA.

00:03:45.858 --> 00:03:47.827 line:5%,start
KELLY: I don't think Abby
has a boyfriend in LA.

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:50.697 line:5%,start
I think that Abby has a friend in LA,

00:03:50.763 --> 00:03:55.268 line:5%,start
a friend who is interested in being
in the tabloids and things like that.

00:03:55.335 --> 00:03:58.438 line:95%,end
Like, if I can make it to the papers,
I'll grab your ass.

00:03:58.504 --> 00:04:01.874 line:95%,end
...and there's people there taking
pictures, why not grab her ass?

00:04:01.941 --> 00:04:03.776 line:95%,end
That's the way to get in the tabloids.

00:04:03.843 --> 00:04:04.677 line:95%,end
Ew.
JEFF: Wow.

00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:07.513 line:95%,end
I don't think that actually means
they're boyfriend-girlfriend.

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:11.150 line:95%,end
All right, so Abby's love life
isn't the only shocker this season.

00:04:11.217 --> 00:04:12.518 line:95%,end
You two had a pretty huge blowout

00:04:12.585 --> 00:04:14.454 line:95%,end
which we talked about
on the reunion show a little bit.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.156 line:95%,end
So in case anybody in the world
missed it, take a look.

00:04:17.223 --> 00:04:19.525 line:95%,end
I don't even want to hear it, Christi,
because, remember, I'm a bad friend.

00:04:19.592 --> 00:04:21.194 line:95%,end
- You know what? You are.
- When I sat here--

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:23.963 line:95%,end
--the entire week you were gone,
and stuck up for you. Whatever.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.566 line:95%,end
You didn't call me because you
were pissed off about something else.

00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:29.369 line:95%,end
That shows me
that you're really not a good friend.

00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:31.537 line:95%,end
Believe me, Christi,
I won't be your friend, ever.

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:34.240 line:95%,end
Oh, because I kiss everyone's ass
to get my kid ahead.

00:04:34.307 --> 00:04:36.709 line:95%,end
- You do! You do.
- No, I don't. [bleep] you, Kelly.

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:38.278 line:95%,end
[bleep] you.

00:04:39.078 --> 00:04:43.750 line:95%,end
Ooh. You know, I have to say,
nobody says "F you" like Christi.

00:04:43.816 --> 00:04:46.819 line:95%,end
Oh, good, thank you.
Although, Kelly's pretty good at it.

00:04:46.886 --> 00:04:49.289 line:95%,end
- I know, yours is my favorite.
- Oh, thanks. [bleep] [bleep].

00:04:49.355 --> 00:04:51.424 line:95%,end
I want to know--
I want to know something.

00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:53.760 line:95%,end
Is there any kind of residual
to what it was that happened

00:04:53.826 --> 00:04:55.828 line:95%,end
that still lingers, or is it all gone?

00:04:55.895 --> 00:04:58.398 line:95%,end
I don't know.
That's a really hard question.

00:04:58.464 --> 00:05:01.734 line:95%,end
True friends are really hard to come by,

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:06.172 line:95%,end
and I thought that we had that.

00:05:06.239 --> 00:05:08.574 line:95%,end
And I hope that we can still have that,

00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:11.010 line:95%,end
but there's always going
to be a part of me

00:05:11.077 --> 00:05:13.780 line:95%,end
that is going to feel like

00:05:13.846 --> 00:05:16.482 line:95%,end
I don't know if she's 100% on my side.

00:05:17.617 --> 00:05:19.752 line:95%,end
How does that make you feel, hearing that?

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:23.990 line:95%,end
Well, you know,
that's Kelly's perception of it.

00:05:24.057 --> 00:05:28.494 line:95%,end
I can't say that you're wrong or you're
right because perception is reality.

00:05:28.561 --> 00:05:30.797 line:95%,end
So, you know,

00:05:30.863 --> 00:05:34.767 line:95%,end
I guess every day we kind of just move
forward and say, this is what's going on.

00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:37.270 line:95%,end
Gaining Kelly's trust

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:39.639 line:95%,end
is something that you don't take lightly.

00:05:40.573 --> 00:05:42.642 line:95%,end
I know that you don't always
trust everyone.

00:05:42.709 --> 00:05:43.876 line:95%,end
I don't.

00:05:43.943 --> 00:05:45.945 line:95%,end
You know, I think my relationship
with Christi--

00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:48.247 line:95%,end
we never had these problems.

00:05:48.314 --> 00:05:54.120 line:95%,end
And then, when this happened, I think
I just know where I stand with her now.

00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:56.889 line:95%,end
All right, well, clearly you two have had
some really rough times on the show.

00:05:56.956 --> 00:06:00.426 line:95%,end
And you've put up with a lot, and you've
sacrificed a lot to be on the show.

00:06:00.493 --> 00:06:03.363 line:95%,end
So let's take a look at this clip and see
what your thoughts are on the back side.

00:06:04.464 --> 00:06:06.466 line:95%,end
[piano music]

00:06:06.532 --> 00:06:10.136 line:95%,end
I think Pappy would be really happy
with your performance today.

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:14.407 line:95%,end
It's hard to see Kelly crying, thinking
about the hard times she went through

00:06:14.474 --> 00:06:16.509 line:95%,end
when her father had prostate cancer.

00:06:16.576 --> 00:06:18.678 line:95%,end
And what really hit home to me is that

00:06:18.745 --> 00:06:20.480 line:95%,end
people come and go
so quickly in your life.

00:06:20.546 --> 00:06:23.683 line:95%,end
And, you know, I love Kelly.
She's like a sister.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.185 line:95%,end
And even if you don't
always like your sister,

00:06:26.252 --> 00:06:28.287 line:95%,end
you always love your sister.

00:06:30.656 --> 00:06:32.358 line:95%,end
I know.

00:06:37.196 --> 00:06:40.666 line:95%,end
Awe, see?
That's what the fans want.

00:06:41.501 --> 00:06:43.870 line:95%,end
- Come on, hug it out. Hug it out.
- Come here, Kelly.

00:06:43.936 --> 00:06:46.105 line:95%,end
- Awe.
- They're still best friends.

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:48.241 line:95%,end
Yay!

00:06:49.842 --> 00:06:52.512 line:95%,end
Fans of the show can't seem to get
enough of Dance Moms drama,

00:06:52.578 --> 00:06:54.614 line:95%,end
and my next two guests are no exception.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.083 line:95%,end
Please welcome two super-fans
of the show,

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:00.853 line:95%,end
two very funny ladies,
comedian and actress Lisa Arch

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.223 line:95%,end
and pop culture goddess Nadine Rajabi.

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.292 line:95%,end
[audience cheering]

00:07:09.662 --> 00:07:11.864 line:95%,end
Welcome. Have a seat. How are you?

00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:14.600 line:95%,end
- Good, how are you? Before we start.
- Have a seat.

00:07:14.667 --> 00:07:17.503 line:95%,end
I just want you to know that I'm such a
super-fan of the show

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:18.938 line:95%,end
that I always wear leg warmers.

00:07:19.005 --> 00:07:21.174 line:95%,end
[Kelly screams]


00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.444 line:5%,start
Always. At all times.
Can I ask them a question?

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:28.281 line:5%,start
Okay, this is my burning question.

00:07:28.347 --> 00:07:31.784 line:95%,end
Do you have time to do anything ever?

00:07:31.851 --> 00:07:34.020 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Other than dance?
- Seriously, like your--

00:07:34.086 --> 00:07:37.757 line:5%,start
I'm going to tell you. I started watching
the show, and my goal instantly became

00:07:37.824 --> 00:07:41.661 line:5%,start
to never let my son be good at anything.

00:07:41.727 --> 00:07:44.130 line:95%,end
Because I'd always spend
my fricking' weekends

00:07:44.197 --> 00:07:46.332 line:95%,end
following him to competitions!

00:07:46.399 --> 00:07:49.035 line:95%,end
- First of all you can never hang.
LISA: What--

00:07:49.101 --> 00:07:50.002 line:95%,end
What do you mean she couldn't hang?

00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:52.371 line:95%,end
You couldn't hang, if her goal's
not to have him be a superstar.

00:07:52.438 --> 00:07:54.440 line:95%,end
She doesn't want him to be mediocre.

00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:58.478 line:95%,end
You can hang with me,
because my kids are mediocre.

00:07:58.544 --> 00:08:01.647 line:95%,end
You know, as Abby always says,
I settle for mediocre.

00:08:01.714 --> 00:08:03.816 line:95%,end
There was one episode where
you were crying because you were like,

00:08:03.883 --> 00:08:05.351 line:95%,end
I just have to get home and do my laundry.

00:08:05.418 --> 00:08:07.487 line:95%,end
- And there's Cheerios everywhere!
KELLY: Yeah.

00:08:07.553 --> 00:08:09.288 line:95%,end
So when does that happen?

00:08:09.355 --> 00:08:13.159 line:95%,end
One thing is we have very good husbands.

00:08:13.226 --> 00:08:19.732 line:95%,end
And, you know, we do have to hire people
to take over some of our jobs.

00:08:19.799 --> 00:08:23.569 line:95%,end
Unfortunately, Christi and I
are not as fortunate as Melissa.

00:08:23.636 --> 00:08:25.404 line:95%,end
- Who hires somebody to do--
- To do everything.

00:08:25.471 --> 00:08:27.907 line:95%,end
Like, oh, I need somebody
to brush my teeth.

00:08:29.642 --> 00:08:32.278 line:95%,end
All right, so listen. Kelly and Christi's
blow up may have registered

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:35.448 line:95%,end
a 9.5 on the Richter scale,
but mom-on-mom rage

00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:38.417 line:95%,end
has been a staple of
Dance Moms since day one.

00:08:38.484 --> 00:08:40.119 line:95%,end
Take a look at this.

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:43.089 line:95%,end
That's more important to me than her
doing a dance with seniors

00:08:43.155 --> 00:08:45.958 line:95%,end
that has known this dance all season,

00:08:46.025 --> 00:08:48.060 line:95%,end
and Abby's throwing it on her
in one night.

00:08:48.127 --> 00:08:51.264 line:95%,end
Listen. You're yelling at me
when you're mad at Abby.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:52.865 line:95%,end
Don't be mad at me because
she didn't learn the number.

00:08:52.932 --> 00:08:54.100 line:95%,end
Jill, you have nothing to do with it.

00:08:54.166 --> 00:08:55.401 line:95%,end
- So butt out.
JILL: I understand that.

00:08:55.468 --> 00:08:57.637 line:95%,end
- So shut your mouth.
- My point exactly.

00:08:57.703 --> 00:09:00.206 line:95%,end
What the [bleep] does it have to do
with Jill?

00:09:00.273 --> 00:09:02.475 line:95%,end
Kelly, stop it.

00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:04.010 line:95%,end
- You!
JILL: What is wrong with you?

00:09:04.076 --> 00:09:05.778 line:95%,end
I don't care what you have to say.

00:09:05.845 --> 00:09:07.280 line:95%,end
Then if you don't care
what I have to say--

00:09:07.346 --> 00:09:09.315 line:95%,end
HOLLY: I don't care what you have to say.
- Then you need to be quiet.

00:09:09.382 --> 00:09:12.084 line:95%,end
- Because this has nothing to do with you.
- No one tells me what to do, Cathy.

00:09:12.151 --> 00:09:15.855 line:95%,end
You may as well stick your hand up her
butt and be her ventriloquist.

00:09:15.922 --> 00:09:19.959 line:95%,end
Who lies all the time? You.
Who had an affair with her boss?

00:09:20.026 --> 00:09:23.195 line:95%,end
Who is living with a man
who is still married?

00:09:23.262 --> 00:09:24.764 line:95%,end
That's it.

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:26.766 line:95%,end
I did not have an affair with my boss.

00:09:26.832 --> 00:09:29.936 line:95%,end
KELLY: Yes, you did!
- [bleep] you. I did not! [bleep] bitch.

00:09:30.503 --> 00:09:33.172 line:95%,end
- And how old are you, double chin?
- Not as old as you.

00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:35.308 line:95%,end
Who would know with all the work
you've had done?

00:09:35.374 --> 00:09:39.645 line:95%,end
- Watch your ugly mouth.
- Ugly mouth. Watch it. Watch it.

00:09:39.712 --> 00:09:40.846 line:95%,end
Everybody thinks you're a man, but--

00:09:40.913 --> 00:09:42.548 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Love that little crooked finger.

00:09:42.615 --> 00:09:44.350 line:95%,end
[interposing voices]

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:47.053 line:95%,end
I don't want to look at you
when I talk to you.

00:09:47.119 --> 00:09:48.120 line:95%,end
--you can't look me in the eye and--

00:09:48.187 --> 00:09:50.022 line:95%,end
I'm looking you in the eye, bitch.

00:09:50.089 --> 00:09:52.091 line:95%,end
Bitch. Let's go. Let's go.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.962 line:95%,end
I think it's hilarious
that you're "fat Christi."

00:09:56.028 --> 00:09:58.197 line:95%,end
- I'm fat Christi.
- That was not me that said that.

00:09:58.264 --> 00:09:59.365 line:95%,end
- That was Asia.
CHRISTI: Yeah.

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:01.534 line:95%,end
Actually, Asia called me
fat Christi on the bus.

00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:03.502 line:95%,end
- That child called you that?
- Absolutely.

00:10:03.569 --> 00:10:06.806 line:95%,end
She said, my mom's skinny Christy.

00:10:06.872 --> 00:10:07.907 line:95%,end
- Yes.
- Fat Christi.

00:10:07.974 --> 00:10:10.309 line:95%,end
KELLY: That's why I referred to her as--

00:10:10.376 --> 00:10:11.377 line:95%,end
LISA: Well, it was very funny--

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:13.479 line:95%,end
I prefer brazenly plump Christi,
but whatever.

00:10:13.546 --> 00:10:16.882 line:95%,end
LISA: That's nice.
- You just don't have the cannons.

00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:19.585 line:95%,end
Wait, she's kind of built
like this martini glass--

00:10:19.652 --> 00:10:21.721 line:95%,end
tiny waist, big old boobs.
Here we go.

00:10:21.787 --> 00:10:23.823 line:95%,end
Do do do do do,
I'm going to kick your ass.

00:10:23.889 --> 00:10:27.560 line:95%,end
When Christie's in the room she's very,
like, that's right little girl. Dance.

00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:30.229 line:95%,end
- No, no. Work. Work
KELLY: Oh, and she always wants.

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:32.498 line:95%,end
LISA: Yes, that is--
- Now, would she scare you?

00:10:32.565 --> 00:10:35.067 line:95%,end
Would she scare you? Because some of
the moms have said they're scared of her.

00:10:35.134 --> 00:10:37.703 line:95%,end
- Which-- She scares me.
LISA: I mean, she's terrifying.

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:43.509 line:95%,end
I think what's scary about her is that
she's, like, don't get in my way.

00:10:43.576 --> 00:10:46.712 line:95%,end
I will have your ass.
She just looks like she's--

00:10:46.779 --> 00:10:49.048 line:95%,end
she's very put together, and, like,
pristine, but she looks like--

00:10:49.115 --> 00:10:52.952 line:95%,end
She's a bodybuilder, you know,
and she's going to kick our asses.

00:10:53.019 --> 00:10:54.453 line:95%,end
But we're not that way.

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.422 line:95%,end
She has, on multiple occasions,
said I'll take you outside.

00:10:56.489 --> 00:10:58.557 line:95%,end
--my mouth is my weapon
and I stop there.


00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.029 line:5%,start
Hi.
Welcome back to Dance Moms Chatter.

00:11:03.095 --> 00:11:04.964 line:5%,start
I'm here with dance moms Christi and Kelly

00:11:05.031 --> 00:11:08.501 line:5%,start
and super-fan comedians
Nadine Rajabi and Lisa Arch,

00:11:08.567 --> 00:11:10.503 line:5%,start
and we're dishing the dirt on Dance Moms.

00:11:10.569 --> 00:11:11.937 line:95%,end
There have been lots of new additions

00:11:12.004 --> 00:11:14.273 line:95%,end
to the Abby Lee Dance company
in the past couple of seasons,

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:17.043 line:95%,end
but few have survived the hazing
they've gotten

00:11:17.109 --> 00:11:18.878 line:95%,end
from some of our veteran moms.
Let's just say--

00:11:18.944 --> 00:11:21.213 line:95%,end
- I don't know what talking about.
- Watch this.

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:24.250 line:95%,end
- The new moms are here.
- The new moms? Okay.

00:11:24.316 --> 00:11:27.119 line:95%,end
- Bring them in.
- What? Hello.

00:11:27.186 --> 00:11:29.288 line:95%,end
- Hello. How are you?
- Hi!

00:11:29.355 --> 00:11:32.158 line:95%,end
- Great, how are you? I love your rings.
- Nice to see you. Hi!

00:11:32.224 --> 00:11:33.426 line:95%,end
- How are you?
- Good.

00:11:33.492 --> 00:11:36.195 line:95%,end
Does anybody have a nail file?
Should we get our cat claws ready?

00:11:37.229 --> 00:11:39.999 line:95%,end
You guys sit here,
and you complain and you complain.

00:11:40.066 --> 00:11:42.702 line:95%,end
And you bitch at Abby,
but you never move.

00:11:42.768 --> 00:11:45.705 line:95%,end
Pick up and move.
Maybe you will find something else.

00:11:45.771 --> 00:11:48.741 line:95%,end
You really, really, really like
to change studios.

00:11:48.808 --> 00:11:51.811 line:95%,end
So maybe you ought to change back and go
back to Studio 19 if it was so great.

00:11:51.877 --> 00:11:53.946 line:95%,end
You know what? Maybe it is.

00:11:54.013 --> 00:11:55.548 line:95%,end
- You played her.
- That's the name.

00:11:55.614 --> 00:11:57.850 line:95%,end
I call it like I see it. It's the truth.
Y'all are all liars.

00:11:57.917 --> 00:12:00.219 line:95%,end
You're liars, especially you.

00:12:00.286 --> 00:12:02.588 line:95%,end
- Oh, yeah. Okay.
KAYA: You are phoney as hell.

00:12:02.655 --> 00:12:06.492 line:95%,end
- So are you.
- From what I see, you're fake.

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:09.228 line:95%,end
Who I am is exactly who I come across as.

00:12:09.295 --> 00:12:12.465 line:95%,end
Yeah, a bitch. That's what you are,
and I know you own it.

00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:17.103 line:95%,end
You don't know a thing, bitch.

00:12:17.169 --> 00:12:18.237 line:95%,end
I'll be that bitch.

00:12:18.304 --> 00:12:20.673 line:95%,end
Don't let the door hit your [bleep]
on the way out, then.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.109 line:95%,end
You want to watch your mouth because
I ain't the rest of these dance mamas.

00:12:23.175 --> 00:12:25.745 line:95%,end
I'm not a doctor like Holly, boo.
I'm from the hood.

00:12:26.445 --> 00:12:29.648 line:95%,end
- Believe that.
- Abby, are you gonna let this happen?

00:12:29.715 --> 00:12:32.284 line:95%,end
- I can't-- I don't use foul language.
CHRISTI: You're darn right we're bitter.

00:12:32.351 --> 00:12:34.520 line:95%,end
KAYA: I don't know how you
work with these parents.

00:12:41.794 --> 00:12:44.530 line:95%,end
All right, she's a fan favorite
of Dance Moms.

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:48.033 line:95%,end
Please welcome Kaya, a.k.a.
Black Patsy.

00:12:48.834 --> 00:12:51.003 line:95%,end
JEFF: Woo, here she comes.

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:53.038 line:95%,end
Wow.

00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:56.575 line:95%,end
How are you? You know I loves me
some Black Patsy.

00:12:57.143 --> 00:12:58.310 line:95%,end
KAYA: You better.
JEFF: Good to see you.

00:12:58.377 --> 00:13:01.413 line:95%,end
So for those of you who've been living
under a rock and don't know,

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:04.150 line:95%,end
how did you
get the nickname Black Patsy?

00:13:05.217 --> 00:13:10.122 line:5%,start
[sighs] Well, my crazy mom thought
that I act like Patsy Ramsey with Nicaya,

00:13:10.189 --> 00:13:12.024 line:5%,start
so she started calling me Patsy.

00:13:12.091 --> 00:13:14.193 line:95%,end
When we started our
St. Louis dance studio,

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.195 line:95%,end
they kind of thought
the same thing for some reason,

00:13:16.262 --> 00:13:17.997 line:95%,end
that I was like a Patsy.

00:13:18.063 --> 00:13:22.301 line:95%,end
So we had a white Patsy, an Italian Patsy,
and I became the Black Patsy.

00:13:22.368 --> 00:13:24.136 line:95%,end
- I wonder why they thought that?
JEFF: Nadine?

00:13:24.203 --> 00:13:26.972 line:95%,end
- I'll be Persian Patsy, then.
KAYA: Persian Patsy.

00:13:27.773 --> 00:13:30.509 line:95%,end
We get banana Patsy,
and color block Patsy--

00:13:30.576 --> 00:13:32.244 line:95%,end
I thought I was white Patsy.

00:13:32.311 --> 00:13:35.681 line:95%,end
I have a feeling that this
one is actually the nicest.

00:13:35.748 --> 00:13:37.416 line:95%,end
- I have a feeling--
KELLY: You're kidding me.

00:13:37.483 --> 00:13:41.821 line:95%,end
LISA: No, I really think that, deep down
inside, that you are the kindest.

00:13:41.887 --> 00:13:46.826 line:95%,end
And that you have to put it out there
that broadly because

00:13:46.892 --> 00:13:47.760 line:95%,end
it's really not you.

00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:50.396 line:95%,end
- She was provoked. She was provoked.
CHRISTI: Oh, my God.

00:13:50.462 --> 00:13:51.931 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Are you saying--
- I really have to disagree.

00:13:51.997 --> 00:13:54.967 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Lisa, are you saying
that she's sad inside?

00:13:55.034 --> 00:13:57.369 line:95%,end
No, I don't think she's sad inside.
I think she's shy inside.

00:13:57.436 --> 00:14:00.005 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Oh, shy. You're shy inside.
- I really am.

00:14:00.072 --> 00:14:02.408 line:95%,end
Oh, my God!
Have you ever watched the show?


00:14:02.474 --> 00:14:04.143 line:95%,end
KAYA: I am shy inside!
- She's not shy!

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:08.614 line:95%,end
You have to put on a tough front with
these bitches. You have to be tough.

00:14:08.681 --> 00:14:10.816 line:95%,end
- I mean bitch in a nice way.
- "These bitches."

00:14:10.883 --> 00:14:12.885 line:95%,end
- I mean bitch in a nice way.
KELLY: Okay, "these bitches."

00:14:12.952 --> 00:14:16.121 line:95%,end
- I mean it in the nicest way possible.
- Oh, I'm sure you do.

00:14:16.188 --> 00:14:18.190 line:95%,end
So Patsy, I've got a question for you.

00:14:18.257 --> 00:14:20.860 line:95%,end
So if you were able to come up
with nicknames for all the other moms,

00:14:20.926 --> 00:14:23.262 line:95%,end
have you ever thought about what would
the nicknames be that you might give them?

00:14:23.329 --> 00:14:24.563 line:95%,end
Let's start with these two.
What would their nicknames be?

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:26.332 line:95%,end
Oh, well, let's start with us.

00:14:26.398 --> 00:14:31.036 line:95%,end
I know I have Mild-Mannered
Melissa and Holy Holly.

00:14:31.103 --> 00:14:33.239 line:95%,end
Oh!

00:14:33.305 --> 00:14:37.810 line:95%,end
KAYA: You would be Crazy Christi,
and you are Clonazepam Kelly.

00:14:37.877 --> 00:14:40.546 line:95%,end
- That's the anxiety med I take.
- What's Clonazepam?

00:14:40.613 --> 00:14:44.116 line:95%,end
KAYA: It's an anxiety medicine. She needs
that. She's Clonazepam Kelly.

00:14:44.183 --> 00:14:47.720 line:95%,end
8- That sounds like a cupcake.
JEFF: That's a drug. Clonazepam is a drug.

00:14:47.786 --> 00:14:49.889 line:95%,end
So, Patsy, what would you call Jill?

00:14:49.955 --> 00:14:52.992 line:95%,end
I don't know if I would call her.
I'm done talking with Jill at this point.

00:14:53.058 --> 00:14:54.927 line:95%,end
I'm about ready to
one-to-the-nose with her,

00:14:54.994 --> 00:14:56.262 line:95%,end
but I won't do that premeditated.

00:14:56.328 --> 00:14:58.831 line:95%,end
- So how about Cathy?
- I love Cathy.

00:14:58.898 --> 00:15:01.100 line:95%,end
KELLY: Oh, you don't love Cathy.
KAYA: She's cool, Cathy.

00:15:01.166 --> 00:15:03.869 line:95%,end
You didn't love Cathy
when you were on our team.

00:15:03.936 --> 00:15:07.306 line:95%,end
- Now all this--
- There'll be [bleep] Abby and Cool Cathy.

00:15:07.373 --> 00:15:10.542 line:95%,end
I never thought I'd be team Black Patsy,
but if you're calling her [bleep] Abby,

00:15:10.609 --> 00:15:12.878 line:95%,end
I might get on board.

00:15:12.945 --> 00:15:14.947 line:95%,end
JEFF: All right, so listen, Patsy. You had
some interesting encounters

00:15:15.014 --> 00:15:16.815 line:95%,end
with Christi and Kelly.

00:15:16.882 --> 00:15:19.118 line:95%,end
What do you think of
the old-school dance moms?

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:22.388 line:95%,end
Be nice.

00:15:22.454 --> 00:15:24.556 line:95%,end
JEFF: Old school meaning
you were in new dance moms,

00:15:24.623 --> 00:15:26.191 line:95%,end
these were the old-school dance moms.

00:15:26.258 --> 00:15:28.427 line:95%,end
- So what do you think of these--
- Um, excuse me, young-school.

00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:30.529 line:95%,end
They were like a gang,
but they weren't willing

00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:32.264 line:95%,end
to jump new moms in that gang, either.

00:15:32.331 --> 00:15:34.366 line:95%,end
Normally gangs are kind of
welcoming to other people.

00:15:34.433 --> 00:15:37.636 line:95%,end
They were just like a gang. Like,
they didn't want me to be part of that.

00:15:37.703 --> 00:15:39.939 line:95%,end
So they were all crazy.

00:15:40.005 --> 00:15:41.473 line:95%,end
JEFF: Nadine and Lisa,
don't you love the way--

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.208 line:95%,end
I love the way Patsy puts
everything into, like,

00:15:43.275 --> 00:15:46.412 line:95%,end
people are going to get jumped.
Somebody's about to get shanked.

00:15:46.478 --> 00:15:47.913 line:95%,end
- It's like--
- I didn't say "shanked."

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:50.049 line:95%,end
Don't make me sound like prison Patsy,
okay.

00:15:50.115 --> 00:15:52.685 line:95%,end
- I didn't say "shanked."
JEFF: What do you think?

00:15:54.053 --> 00:15:55.154 line:95%,end
- Go ahead.
- Well, okay. First of all.

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:58.457 line:95%,end
I think you'll agree to this.
I think you are very intimidating,

00:15:58.524 --> 00:16:01.827 line:95%,end
and I think coming into this group
that's been together for many years

00:16:01.894 --> 00:16:05.597 line:95%,end
would be a little scary to walk into.

00:16:05.664 --> 00:16:07.666 line:95%,end
Can I just defend these two ladies?
I feel like--

00:16:07.733 --> 00:16:09.702 line:95%,end
No! Not if you're on my couch.
You take your ass over there

00:16:09.768 --> 00:16:10.769 line:95%,end
if you want to defend them.

00:16:10.836 --> 00:16:13.439 line:95%,end
- Excuse me.
- You come sit by me, girlfriend.

00:16:13.505 --> 00:16:15.741 line:95%,end
- Bye bye.
- Come on over.

00:16:16.575 --> 00:16:19.912 line:95%,end
I feel like these ladies
were like the American Indians.

00:16:19.979 --> 00:16:22.948 line:95%,end
And then the pilgrims came,
and just ran them over.

00:16:23.015 --> 00:16:25.417 line:95%,end
- And, Patsy, it's not their fault!
CHRISTI: Word to your mother!

00:16:25.484 --> 00:16:27.353 line:95%,end
We all live in a tee-pee here.

00:16:27.419 --> 00:16:32.858 line:95%,end
You know, everything you just said, it's
clear, Kelly, you guys are intimidating.

00:16:32.925 --> 00:16:36.428 line:95%,end
You're a clique.
Whether or not you mean to be,

00:16:36.495 --> 00:16:40.566 line:95%,end
it's hard walking in to a room
where you guys are sitting.

00:16:40.632 --> 00:16:44.269 line:95%,end
I'd be terrified. So I think, maybe,

00:16:44.336 --> 00:16:47.506 line:95%,end
maybe shy Patsy just had her guard up
a little bit when she came in.

00:16:47.573 --> 00:16:48.707 line:95%,end
Oh, I don't know about that.

00:16:48.774 --> 00:16:51.110 line:95%,end
I think you have to be tough
to hang in there, and, so far,

00:16:51.176 --> 00:16:53.946 line:95%,end
a year later, I'm still hanging in there.
So, obviously, I made the cut.

00:16:54.013 --> 00:16:55.714 line:95%,end
Well, you know what, Patsy?
I give you a lot of credit

00:16:55.781 --> 00:16:56.982 line:95%,end
because we are tough bitches.

00:16:57.049 --> 00:16:58.350 line:95%,end
- You are some tough bitches!
CHRISTI: Welcome to the club!

00:16:58.417 --> 00:17:00.219 line:95%,end
You guys are from the hood, too,
aren't you?

00:17:00.285 --> 00:17:02.354 line:95%,end
Tough bitches.
Let's hear it for some tough bitches.


00:17:05.924 --> 00:17:09.194 line:5%,start
I'm here with dance moms
Kelly, Christi, and Kaya,

00:17:09.261 --> 00:17:11.797 line:5%,start
and we've got some super-fans
who also happen to be

00:17:11.864 --> 00:17:15.434 line:5%,start
incredible comedians,
Nadine Rajabi and Lisa Arch.

00:17:15.501 --> 00:17:18.170 line:5%,start
All right, so, Lisa and Nadine, you guys
claim to be super-fans of the show.

00:17:18.237 --> 00:17:20.973 line:95%,end
So let's put your Dance
Moms knowledge to the test.

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.442 line:95%,end
It's time to play the $10 Pyramid,
that's right,

00:17:23.509 --> 00:17:26.278 line:95%,end
I said $10 because that's how
we roll here at Dance Moms.

00:17:26.345 --> 00:17:27.413 line:95%,end
Are you guys ready to play?

00:17:27.479 --> 00:17:28.914 line:95%,end
- I think so.
- Yes!

00:17:28.981 --> 00:17:29.982 line:95%,end
All right.

00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:32.251 line:95%,end
[game show theme music]

00:17:32.317 --> 00:17:33.419 line:95%,end
Here's what we're going to do.

00:17:33.485 --> 00:17:35.454 line:95%,end
I'm going to flip a square.
Emily's going to help me here.

00:17:35.521 --> 00:17:36.355 line:95%,end
JEFF: How about a hand for Emily?

00:17:36.422 --> 00:17:38.357 line:95%,end
You have a model to do this--

00:17:38.424 --> 00:17:41.226 line:95%,end
I have, not only a model,
I have a supermodel here.

00:17:41.293 --> 00:17:42.761 line:95%,end
- What kind of BS is that?
- I have a super here, this is Emily--

00:17:42.828 --> 00:17:45.798 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: She's doing it for the exposure.
- All right, fine. Fine.

00:17:45.864 --> 00:17:47.699 line:95%,end
All right. So here's what we're gonna do.
I'm gonna flip a square.

00:17:47.766 --> 00:17:49.501 line:95%,end
I'm gonna ask a question,
and the first one of you

00:17:49.568 --> 00:17:52.704 line:95%,end
to chime in and get the answer right--

00:17:52.771 --> 00:17:54.106 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Are we allowed to play? Okay.
JEFF: --wins $10.

00:17:54.173 --> 00:17:57.509 line:95%,end
JEFF: So this is a game
for Nadine and Lisa, right?

00:17:57.576 --> 00:17:58.844 line:95%,end
- Oh, we can't play?
- We're not allowed to play?

00:17:58.911 --> 00:18:01.747 line:95%,end
- You already know the answers--
- You guys, just drink. Just drink.

00:18:01.814 --> 00:18:06.118 line:95%,end
- Take it as an opportunity to drink.
- This is our chance to be dance moms.

00:18:06.585 --> 00:18:08.487 line:95%,end
All right, so here's the first one.

00:18:09.121 --> 00:18:14.526 line:95%,end
All right, which of these sea creatures
did the dance moms say Abby looked like?

00:18:14.593 --> 00:18:18.063 line:95%,end
Was it Fudgie the Whale,
The Little Mermaid,

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:20.833 line:95%,end
Free Willy, or Shamu?

00:18:20.899 --> 00:18:23.769 line:95%,end
Well, I know that it's not
The Little Mermaid, clearly.

00:18:23.836 --> 00:18:28.640 line:95%,end
And she might be Fudgie the Whale,
but I don't think she is.

00:18:28.707 --> 00:18:31.243 line:95%,end
And she's not Free Willy because
she's always stuck in the dance studio.

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:34.113 line:95%,end
- But she's still a mammal, so she's
Shamu.

00:18:34.179 --> 00:18:38.217 line:95%,end
- Whoo!
JEFF: The answer is Shamu.

00:18:39.718 --> 00:18:40.786 line:95%,end
Ten dollars.

00:18:40.853 --> 00:18:43.822 line:95%,end
Did you see her? In that all black,

00:18:43.889 --> 00:18:47.893 line:95%,end
and she had four-inch white
stripe down the bottom of her.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.928 line:95%,end
Now, how could you not call her Shamu?

00:18:49.995 --> 00:18:52.231 line:95%,end
JEFF: Second question--
- Can she swim?

00:18:52.297 --> 00:18:56.768 line:95%,end
Cathy would slit her wrists
if Vivi did what instead of dance?

00:18:56.835 --> 00:18:59.171 line:95%,end
I know this answer, talk.

00:18:59.238 --> 00:19:03.575 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: No.
- No, is it baseball?

00:19:03.642 --> 00:19:06.178 line:95%,end
- Play baseball?
- Close! Close, the girl version.

00:19:06.245 --> 00:19:09.047 line:95%,end
- Softball!
- Softball.

00:19:12.117 --> 00:19:14.953 line:95%,end
LISA: Let the model do it, Jeff.
That's what she's there for.

00:19:16.421 --> 00:19:18.590 line:95%,end
Which historical figure has
not been the subject

00:19:18.657 --> 00:19:20.259 line:95%,end
of an Abby Lee Dance Company number.

00:19:20.325 --> 00:19:23.428 line:95%,end
Rosa Parks, Eva Peron, or Helen Keller?

00:19:23.495 --> 00:19:25.964 line:95%,end
So we know that Rosa Parks
was the big one.

00:19:26.031 --> 00:19:28.367 line:95%,end
NADINE RAJABI: Is it Eva Peron?
- I'll go with Nadine.

00:19:28.433 --> 00:19:31.103 line:95%,end
JEFF: And the answer is Eva Peron.
You're correct.

00:19:32.471 --> 00:19:37.042 line:95%,end
All right, so Abby said, "gimmicks are
great, the judges are looking for," blank.

00:19:37.109 --> 00:19:38.844 line:95%,end
Technique! Always technique.

00:19:38.911 --> 00:19:41.647 line:95%,end
- I had the answer.
- I was going to say the same.

00:19:41.713 --> 00:19:43.515 line:95%,end
That's what I was going to say.
JEFF: All right, here we go.

00:19:43.582 --> 00:19:45.083 line:95%,end
Let's do another one.

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:51.390 line:95%,end
What was Christi afraid
Black Patsy would pull out?

00:19:51.456 --> 00:19:54.893 line:95%,end
Was it her thong, her teeth, or her weave?

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.629 line:95%,end
I would think that Christi would be afraid


00:19:57.696 --> 00:20:00.832 line:95%,end
that Black Patsy would pull out
another $100,000 contract.

00:20:00.899 --> 00:20:02.868 line:95%,end
Amen!

00:20:02.935 --> 00:20:05.404 line:95%,end
LISA: I'm going to go
with her weave, clearly.

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:07.606 line:95%,end
JEFF: Her weave?
- And I am not wearing a weave today.

00:20:07.673 --> 00:20:10.309 line:95%,end
- I am au naturel. Girl.
NADINE RAJABI: Girl.

00:20:11.109 --> 00:20:13.345 line:95%,end
And the answer is her weave.

00:20:14.213 --> 00:20:17.883 line:95%,end
Let me just say
that it's not "naturel," it's bleach.

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:20.519 line:95%,end
- Well, of course it's bleach.
JEFF: Last question.

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:24.256 line:95%,end
All right, according
to the other dance moms,

00:20:24.323 --> 00:20:27.226 line:95%,end
where did Jill get her blue fur vest?

00:20:27.292 --> 00:20:29.294 line:95%,end
- Cookie monster?
KELLY: Yes!

00:20:29.361 --> 00:20:31.997 line:95%,end
There is a naked Muppet
running around somewhere.

00:20:33.198 --> 00:20:36.168 line:95%,end
KELLY: She skinned a puppet.
CHRISTI: That poor, little, naked Muppet.

00:20:36.235 --> 00:20:39.104 line:95%,end
JEFF: All right. Thank you for playing.

00:20:40.239 --> 00:20:41.807 line:95%,end
So I have a question.
Where's our money?

00:20:41.873 --> 00:20:42.908 line:95%,end
Where's our money?

00:20:42.975 --> 00:20:44.743 line:95%,end
- The check is in the mail.
- Check is the mail.

00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:45.911 line:95%,end
KELLY: Jeff always says that.
JEFF: All right, listen.

00:20:45.978 --> 00:20:48.914 line:95%,end
One of the things that fans love
to post about are your looks.

00:20:48.981 --> 00:20:51.416 line:95%,end
They seem to be obsessed with
your hair, with your clothes,

00:20:51.483 --> 00:20:53.518 line:95%,end
with your jewelry, with your shoes.

00:20:53.585 --> 00:20:56.588 line:95%,end
So who would you two say is
the most looks-obsessed

00:20:56.655 --> 00:20:58.991 line:95%,end
of all the dance moms? Who is it?

00:20:59.057 --> 00:21:00.525 line:95%,end
- CHRISTI: Jill.
- Absolutely Jill.

00:21:00.592 --> 00:21:02.494 line:95%,end
JEFF: Oh, that was an easy one, huh?
- Absolutely.

00:21:02.561 --> 00:21:05.897 line:95%,end
Who puts lip gloss on to get off the bus
at 5:00 PM on a Sunday?

00:21:05.964 --> 00:21:08.533 line:95%,end
Was she always like that,
even before there were cameras?

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:12.537 line:95%,end
JEFF: Let's do this. We put together a
series of clips of Jill's fashion faux pas

00:21:12.604 --> 00:21:15.107 line:95%,end
so let's take a look at this, and
then, when we come out on the other side,

00:21:15.173 --> 00:21:17.175 line:95%,end
Lisa and Nadine,
you guys tell us what you think.

00:21:17.242 --> 00:21:19.311 line:95%,end
I feel like one of her outfits--
like, Tony the Tiger,

00:21:19.378 --> 00:21:21.213 line:95%,end
I'm convinced,
died for one of her sweaters.

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.482 line:95%,end
Yeah.
Oh, the one with the blue eyes.

00:21:23.548 --> 00:21:25.384 line:95%,end
My favorite is cowboy Jill.

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:27.085 line:95%,end
- Oh, mine too.
JEFF: Cowboy Jill.

00:21:27.152 --> 00:21:29.288 line:95%,end
- You can't take her seriously--
JEFF: The cowboy hat?

00:21:29.354 --> 00:21:31.323 line:95%,end
You cannot take her seriously
with the cowboy hat.

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:34.993 line:95%,end
In interviews, too. That's the best part.
She's in full character.

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:37.462 line:95%,end
Where she finds the [bleep],
I don't know.

00:21:37.529 --> 00:21:40.332 line:95%,end
For me, there's nothing
better than a turtleneck

00:21:40.399 --> 00:21:44.002 line:95%,end
with a full a necklace of crystals.

00:21:44.069 --> 00:21:47.639 line:95%,end
It's like she raided Elizabeth
Taylor's closet after she died,

00:21:47.706 --> 00:21:50.842 line:95%,end
and, like, put everything on all at once.

00:21:50.909 --> 00:21:54.246 line:95%,end
What's that old thing they used to say?
Look in the mirror and take one thing off?

00:21:54.313 --> 00:21:57.015 line:95%,end
With Jill, it should be look in the mirror
and take everything off.

00:21:57.082 --> 00:21:59.985 line:95%,end
No, Jill looks in the mirror
and puts three things on.

00:22:00.052 --> 00:22:02.854 line:95%,end
Abby herself has undergone some changes
over the last seasons--

00:22:02.921 --> 00:22:04.790 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Oh, ho ho!
JEFF: --I would say. Isn't that fair?

00:22:04.856 --> 00:22:08.160 line:95%,end
- Oh, fair.
- So let's check out some of Abby's looks.

00:22:08.226 --> 00:22:09.895 line:95%,end
- Take a look.
- Oh, god.

00:22:09.961 --> 00:22:12.230 line:95%,end
I'm not going to be nice. Oh!

00:22:12.297 --> 00:22:14.933 line:95%,end
So, ladies, what do you think
about that look?

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.136 line:95%,end
She looks like Rosie O'Donnell's
stepsister.

00:22:18.203 --> 00:22:20.472 line:95%,end
- Let's see the next one.
- I mean, that's clearly--

00:22:20.539 --> 00:22:23.675 line:95%,end
I need a little lipstick. I've got to
floof up the hair, no more headbands.

00:22:23.742 --> 00:22:25.477 line:95%,end
So that's just her evolving.

00:22:25.544 --> 00:22:27.646 line:95%,end
Let's take a look at the next one.
Here we go.

00:22:27.713 --> 00:22:29.514 line:95%,end
- Whoa!
CHRISTI: Oh, oh.

00:22:30.782 --> 00:22:33.418 line:95%,end
Okay, so now, that is the full evolution.

00:22:33.485 --> 00:22:35.821 line:95%,end
That is, I have now become, oh.

00:22:35.887 --> 00:22:38.957 line:95%,end
I'm wearing the fur--
hopefully it's faux fur.

00:22:39.024 --> 00:22:42.127 line:95%,end
LISA: She's got the sunglasses.
She's got the lips. She's got the bag.

00:22:42.194 --> 00:22:43.328 line:95%,end
Full evolution.

00:22:43.395 --> 00:22:45.764 line:95%,end
It's very, sort of, John Belushi
playing Elizabeth Taylor, isn't it?

00:22:45.831 --> 00:22:47.499 line:95%,end
NADINE RAJABI: It is. It is.
LISA: A little bit.


00:22:51.303 --> 00:22:53.705 line:5%,start
We're here with dance moms Christi,
Kelly, Kaya,

00:22:53.772 --> 00:22:58.143 line:5%,start
plus super-fan comedians
Lisa Arch and Nadine Rajabi.

00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:00.011 line:95%,end
I love to say your name.
That's so much fun.

00:23:00.078 --> 00:23:04.516 line:95%,end
All right. It seems like the competition
has really been heating up this season.

00:23:04.583 --> 00:23:07.552 line:95%,end
Let's take a look at the meltdown moments.

00:23:07.619 --> 00:23:08.987 line:95%,end
Good job!

00:23:09.054 --> 00:23:10.122 line:95%,end
Oh.

00:23:10.188 --> 00:23:14.226 line:95%,end
Just so you know, Abby's going to come
in here. It's going to be awful.

00:23:17.028 --> 00:23:20.031 line:95%,end
Nice job, Chloe. Huh!

00:23:20.098 --> 00:23:21.166 line:95%,end
- Nice job.
- Let's go. We're leaving.

00:23:21.233 --> 00:23:22.701 line:95%,end
You want Chloe gone? We're gone.

00:23:22.768 --> 00:23:24.169 line:95%,end
You get your way.
You can have whoever you--

00:23:24.236 --> 00:23:26.104 line:95%,end
I look about three months pregnant there.

00:23:26.171 --> 00:23:28.306 line:95%,end
- No, she didn't.
- And then drops her hat. Yes, she did.

00:23:28.373 --> 00:23:29.908 line:95%,end
- No, she didn't. You know what--
- Yes, she did.

00:23:29.975 --> 00:23:32.778 line:95%,end
You go ahead and replace me. I'm leaving.
I'm not going to make a scene with you.

00:23:32.844 --> 00:23:35.480 line:95%,end
ABBY: Oh, that's the easy way out, right?
- No. I'm done. I'm done.

00:23:35.547 --> 00:23:38.150 line:95%,end
This is not what I signed up for,
humiliation for my daughter.

00:23:38.216 --> 00:23:41.353 line:95%,end
I didn't humiliate her! She humiliated
herself when she fell out of the turn.

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:43.622 line:95%,end
Shut up. Shut up. Stop talking now.

00:23:43.688 --> 00:23:47.092 line:95%,end
Replace us. That's fine. Come on, Chlo.
We're done.

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:51.096 line:95%,end
- She was completely confident.
- Yeah.

00:23:51.163 --> 00:23:53.732 line:95%,end
And she wanted to prove
to her dance teacher

00:23:53.799 --> 00:23:56.067 line:95%,end
that she was strong enough
to stand up to somebody.

00:23:56.134 --> 00:23:58.503 line:95%,end
- And she did. She was great.
- Yeah. Okay.

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:01.473 line:95%,end
Do you want your kid just to be
another pretty face, Kelly?

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:03.542 line:95%,end
Don't you want her to have some guts?

00:24:03.608 --> 00:24:05.777 line:95%,end
She stands up to you every week.

00:24:05.844 --> 00:24:08.647 line:95%,end
Every day, when you scream at her,
she stands up to you.

00:24:08.713 --> 00:24:12.751 line:95%,end
Miss Cathy had a bunch of kids
that don't even take from you anymore.

00:24:12.818 --> 00:24:15.487 line:95%,end
- That's ridiculous.
- You never produced anything.

00:24:15.554 --> 00:24:16.555 line:95%,end
Anything!

00:24:16.621 --> 00:24:20.525 line:95%,end
You make an ass of yourself, and they know
it just as well as everybody else.

00:24:20.592 --> 00:24:22.794 line:95%,end
- Well, I sleep at night.
- I do, too.

00:24:22.861 --> 00:24:24.529 line:95%,end
You think I lose sleep over you?

00:24:24.596 --> 00:24:29.768 line:95%,end
Do you think I've given up my whole life
and all the organizations that I belong to

00:24:29.835 --> 00:24:32.737 line:95%,end
to deal with that piece of crap? No.

00:24:33.605 --> 00:24:35.841 line:95%,end
She is dirt under my feet.

00:24:36.475 --> 00:24:39.177 line:95%,end
She hit me. There's no going back.

00:24:39.244 --> 00:24:41.713 line:95%,end
The minute she struck me,
she left the room.

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:46.384 line:95%,end
She doesn't even walk in my circle.
She does not live in my world.

00:24:50.922 --> 00:24:52.824 line:95%,end
Chloe is a product of you.

00:24:52.891 --> 00:24:55.494 line:95%,end
She's been at your studios
since she was two.

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:58.730 line:95%,end
- She's lazy. Fix it!
- And why don't you say do this?

00:24:58.797 --> 00:25:00.765 line:95%,end
- This is how you fix it.
- She doesn't!

00:25:00.832 --> 00:25:05.003 line:95%,end
I'm not a dance teacher. You tell me every
day. Chloe is your student.

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:08.406 line:95%,end
You are a plagiarist because that little
girl is somebody else's student.

00:25:08.473 --> 00:25:10.876 line:95%,end
- You just put your name on her back.
- You're ridiculous.

00:25:10.942 --> 00:25:13.745 line:95%,end
Chloe was awful today.

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:17.249 line:95%,end
Ooh.
We got some mama drama going on.

00:25:17.315 --> 00:25:19.484 line:95%,end
That's hard to watch. I mean, it's hard.

00:25:19.551 --> 00:25:23.688 line:95%,end
But here's the thing. I feel like Abby
just gets off on doing this.

00:25:23.755 --> 00:25:26.224 line:95%,end
And then she'll say, you know what,
because you guys [bleep] up,

00:25:26.291 --> 00:25:29.494 line:95%,end
sorry, I'm going to pull your daughter.
And I don't think it's fair.

00:25:29.561 --> 00:25:32.364 line:95%,end
Oh, really? You see that?
Because that's what I see.

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:34.966 line:95%,end
- It's like she spent people--
- Do you see what I see?

00:25:35.033 --> 00:25:37.135 line:95%,end
Okay, but wait. I'm going to throw
a little wrench into this.

00:25:37.202 --> 00:25:40.005 line:95%,end
- Oh, stop with your wrenches.
- No, because, Christi, listen.

00:25:40.071 --> 00:25:44.142 line:95%,end
The one where you were upset,
you said,

00:25:44.209 --> 00:25:46.645 line:95%,end
"Oh well, Abby. Go ahead and replace me."

00:25:46.711 --> 00:25:48.847 line:95%,end
And I thought, wait a minute, replace you?

00:25:48.914 --> 00:25:51.082 line:95%,end
Wouldn't it be your
daughter she's replacing?

00:25:51.149 --> 00:25:53.318 line:95%,end
- Well, yes. Yes.
- Absolutely.

00:25:53.385 --> 00:25:55.954 line:95%,end
However, we go together.

00:25:56.021 --> 00:26:00.725 line:95%,end
I mean, Abby will be the first to say
that she looks at the child,

00:26:00.792 --> 00:26:01.993 line:95%,end
and she looks at the mom.

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:05.130 line:95%,end
And she likes a mom
who can either make a costume

00:26:05.196 --> 00:26:07.032 line:95%,end
or pay someone who will make a costume.

00:26:07.098 --> 00:26:08.600 line:95%,end
So we're clearly a team.

00:26:08.667 --> 00:26:11.670 line:95%,end
So you guys always have to be
on your best behavior--

00:26:11.736 --> 00:26:14.005 line:95%,end
or your daughters get punished.

00:26:14.072 --> 00:26:16.908 line:95%,end
But I've been trying, this season,
to behave myself.

00:26:16.975 --> 00:26:18.910 line:95%,end
- And my kids still--
- Have you?

00:26:18.977 --> 00:26:22.480 line:95%,end
Yeah, I absolutely have been.
I have been.

00:26:22.547 --> 00:26:25.383 line:95%,end
I haven't been fighting with Abby
is what I should say.

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:28.887 line:95%,end
So did you guys have a favorite moment
when you saw those clips?

00:26:28.954 --> 00:26:31.022 line:95%,end
- Just now?
- Oh, they're all lovely.

00:26:31.089 --> 00:26:34.759 line:95%,end
You know, look. Honestly, when I'm
at home watching the show


00:26:34.826 --> 00:26:38.597 line:95%,end
and there is the moment of,
you know, Christi packing her stuff,

00:26:38.663 --> 00:26:40.565 line:95%,end
and "We are out of here,"
and all of those moments

00:26:40.632 --> 00:26:42.467 line:95%,end
of people constantly leaving--

00:26:42.534 --> 00:26:46.304 line:95%,end
I want a montage of just the goodbyes.

00:26:46.371 --> 00:26:48.373 line:95%,end
Just, you know, there they are,
everybody's leaving,

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:49.441 line:95%,end
and then they've come back.

00:26:49.507 --> 00:26:50.609 line:95%,end
- I'm done!
LISA: And now they're all leaving again.

00:26:50.675 --> 00:26:52.978 line:95%,end
- That's what we say-- I kinda like that.
- I'm done!

00:26:53.044 --> 00:26:55.013 line:95%,end
Those are my favorite moments.

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:58.883 line:95%,end
I love Christi in a skin-tight dress
and 6 inch heels on her knees,

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:00.785 line:95%,end
like, packing the bag.

00:27:00.852 --> 00:27:03.154 line:95%,end
So does my husband, Jeff.
So does my husband.

00:27:03.221 --> 00:27:05.056 line:95%,end
And then they come back,
and then they'll go,

00:27:05.123 --> 00:27:07.325 line:95%,end
"Oh, no, why is my daughter suspended?"

00:27:07.392 --> 00:27:10.128 line:95%,end
It's cause you guys quit,
and then you're back again.

00:27:10.195 --> 00:27:12.297 line:95%,end
But then, like it's shocking.
It's like-- sorry,

00:27:12.364 --> 00:27:15.266 line:95%,end
I know, I was team
Christie-- but, like--

00:27:16.301 --> 00:27:19.037 line:95%,end
NADINE RAJABI: I'm just saying-- Sorry.
- Nadine, you traitor.

00:27:19.104 --> 00:27:21.306 line:95%,end
I do have to say, though,
there is a lot of mom crying.

00:27:21.373 --> 00:27:25.510 line:95%,end
There's not a lot more mom drama
and mom crying on the show

00:27:25.577 --> 00:27:27.612 line:95%,end
than there is the kids.

00:27:27.679 --> 00:27:29.681 line:95%,end
- The kids are great.
- That's the part that I find interesting.

00:27:29.748 --> 00:27:31.516 line:95%,end
Now, you, I don't know if
I've ever seen shed a tear.

00:27:31.583 --> 00:27:33.118 line:95%,end
- Oh, I'm a mess.
- Have you?

00:27:33.184 --> 00:27:35.320 line:95%,end
- I've cried a couple times.
LISA: But the girls do not.

00:27:35.387 --> 00:27:38.623 line:95%,end
Now, I cry when wonderful
things happen to Chloe.

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:40.659 line:95%,end
I'm like, [whining].

00:27:40.725 --> 00:27:42.027 line:95%,end
LISA: Right. You're a happy crier.

00:27:42.093 --> 00:27:44.095 line:95%,end
Speaking of kids,
Abby gave Chloe and Maddie

00:27:44.162 --> 00:27:47.065 line:95%,end
the same choreography
for a solo this season.

00:27:47.132 --> 00:27:49.367 line:95%,end
Why do you think she did that, Christi?

00:27:49.434 --> 00:27:53.972 line:95%,end
To shut me up because I kept saying,
put them on a level playing field.

00:27:54.039 --> 00:27:57.609 line:95%,end
I did. I said, put them on a level playing
field, and let's see where the chips fall.

no crying in baseball,

00:30:33.231 --> 00:30:35.533 line:95%,end
but there certainly are
some tears in television.

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:39.170 line:95%,end
And it wouldn't be an episode of Dance
Moms without some waterworks.

00:30:39.237 --> 00:30:41.339 line:95%,end
Take a look at this.

00:30:41.406 --> 00:30:43.608 line:95%,end
Okay, stop crying. It's making it worse.

00:30:45.109 --> 00:30:46.477 line:95%,end
- I want to go home.
- What do you mean?

00:30:46.544 --> 00:30:50.615 line:95%,end
- You never leave the dance, Mad.
- No, my stomach just started to hurt.

00:30:50.682 --> 00:30:53.585 line:95%,end
- I don't know why.
- You never miss dance.

00:30:55.486 --> 00:30:58.189 line:95%,end
But we know you're a good friend,
and those who know you--

00:30:58.256 --> 00:31:01.092 line:95%,end
Just please stop, okay.

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:04.162 line:95%,end
[crying]

00:31:07.065 --> 00:31:09.300 line:95%,end
Brooke, what's going on with your mom?

00:31:09.367 --> 00:31:11.302 line:95%,end
HOLLY: She's hyperventilating.
- Bad.

00:31:12.537 --> 00:31:14.639 line:95%,end
Come here. Just come with me.
Kelly, you're making me really scared.

00:31:14.706 --> 00:31:16.708 line:95%,end
- You're getting really--
HOLLY: Okay, Kelly Kelly.

00:31:16.774 --> 00:31:19.777 line:95%,end
Please, just take some deep breaths.
That's all.

00:31:20.879 --> 00:31:22.313 line:95%,end
I'm done.

00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:26.584 line:95%,end
She walked right into the curling iron.

00:31:26.651 --> 00:31:28.219 line:95%,end
Oh, sweetie.

00:31:28.286 --> 00:31:29.354 line:95%,end
[sobbing]

00:31:31.756 --> 00:31:34.792 line:95%,end
I'm going to ask you just to do for me--

00:31:35.727 --> 00:31:39.731 line:95%,end
just an apology.
Take him, and then we'll work it out.

00:31:39.797 --> 00:31:43.401 line:95%,end
I know that you guys don't understand
what Jalen does at his level.

00:31:44.769 --> 00:31:47.138 line:95%,end
- But he's very good at what he does.
- I know he is.

00:31:47.205 --> 00:31:50.174 line:95%,end
And he's working his ass off,
and you got some kid that comes in here

00:31:50.241 --> 00:31:53.011 line:95%,end
that you're praising that ain't putting in
half the effort he does.

00:31:53.077 --> 00:31:55.346 line:95%,end
- He's got a point, guys.
- That's BS.

00:31:55.847 --> 00:31:58.650 line:95%,end
- I should just go home.
- Okay, but, honey, but don't cry.

00:31:58.716 --> 00:32:01.152 line:95%,end
- Why are you crying?
- I don't want to let her down.

00:32:01.219 --> 00:32:04.422 line:95%,end
Awe, honey, I know you don't.
But you're not letting Miss Abby down.

00:32:04.489 --> 00:32:08.359 line:95%,end
It will let her down if you hurt it worse,
and she understands that.

00:32:08.426 --> 00:32:11.829 line:95%,end
You can't humiliate her
over, and over, and over.

00:32:11.896 --> 00:32:14.799 line:95%,end
- I know. I know.
- What is wrong with me?

00:32:15.266 --> 00:32:18.836 line:95%,end
You'll be okay. It's okay.

00:32:20.004 --> 00:32:21.706 line:95%,end
Don't be sad.

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:25.176 line:95%,end
You looked beautiful for what you did do.

00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:30.581 line:95%,end
She reveled in doing that
to an 11-year-old.

00:32:30.648 --> 00:32:34.919 line:95%,end
- She did it-- she did it to my--
HOLLY: Your baby.

00:32:37.288 --> 00:32:39.691 line:95%,end
What are we doing to our kids?

00:32:46.864 --> 00:32:49.267 line:95%,end
You were so cute.
You never hurt anybody.

00:32:50.835 --> 00:32:52.804 line:95%,end
She made everybody smile.

00:32:53.705 --> 00:32:55.406 line:95%,end
- Come on, big mama. We got--
- Come on.

00:32:55.473 --> 00:32:57.976 line:95%,end
- I don't want to go in crying.
- Seriously. Come on.

00:33:00.578 --> 00:33:04.816 line:95%,end
Kids should cry when their arm is broken
and it's hanging off, or somebody died.

00:33:04.882 --> 00:33:06.317 line:95%,end
That's it.

00:33:06.384 --> 00:33:08.319 line:95%,end
- Oh.
JEFF: This is my favorite.

00:33:10.154 --> 00:33:13.291 line:95%,end
Sometimes people just cross the line.

00:33:13.358 --> 00:33:15.293 line:95%,end
Cathy crossed the line.

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:18.029 line:95%,end
It's been a rough day,
and I've had enough.

00:33:18.463 --> 00:33:20.465 line:95%,end
[snorting]

00:33:23.401 --> 00:33:25.036 line:95%,end
I can't.

00:33:26.671 --> 00:33:27.805 line:95%,end
I just can't.

00:33:27.872 --> 00:33:29.140 line:95%,end
JEFF: --she's trying to breathe through
it.

00:33:29.207 --> 00:33:30.441 line:95%,end
[breathing heavily]

00:33:30.508 --> 00:33:32.076 line:95%,end
It's like Lamaze.

00:33:33.211 --> 00:33:35.146 line:95%,end
You're-- you're-- Sit.

00:33:35.213 --> 00:33:37.215 line:95%,end
- Everyone's like, here--
- I know, my God.

00:33:37.281 --> 00:33:39.450 line:95%,end
Your blood pressure.

00:33:40.752 --> 00:33:42.653 line:95%,end
I've never seen Abby like this.

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:45.390 line:95%,end
I think losing to Cathy really got to her.


00:33:45.456 --> 00:33:47.125 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Yes, I think so, too.
- It was losing.

00:33:47.191 --> 00:33:50.228 line:95%,end
- It wasn't the hitting by the purse.
- She's going to have a heart attack.

00:33:51.562 --> 00:33:54.999 line:95%,end
I got in a fight with a man earlier
who was belligerent.

00:33:55.066 --> 00:33:59.904 line:95%,end
Now I come in Cathy she brings three men

00:33:59.971 --> 00:34:02.974 line:95%,end
into the dressing room,
which I don't appreciate.

00:34:03.041 --> 00:34:05.476 line:95%,end
And then she whacks me with a purse.

00:34:05.543 --> 00:34:07.378 line:95%,end
Then I came in my dressing room,
and got in a fight

00:34:07.445 --> 00:34:10.348 line:95%,end
with my own student and her mother, Holly.

00:34:10.915 --> 00:34:14.886 line:95%,end
What goes around, comes around.
And karma's there when you need it.

00:34:14.952 --> 00:34:19.157 line:95%,end
So it's been a long day.
I was in the wrong. I know that.

00:34:19.223 --> 00:34:20.792 line:95%,end
I've had it.

00:34:23.995 --> 00:34:26.597 line:95%,end
I've had it. I've finished.

00:34:30.468 --> 00:34:32.870 line:95%,end
- Put on your Sasquatch cloak.
- Let me put on my cape.

00:34:34.272 --> 00:34:36.007 line:95%,end
It's a cloak.

00:34:36.074 --> 00:34:38.443 line:95%,end
JEFF: Whoa!
- It's a damn curtain.

00:34:38.509 --> 00:34:40.244 line:95%,end
LISA: It was a curtain.

00:34:42.146 --> 00:34:44.315 line:95%,end
Wait, I think Christi's got
something to say.

00:34:44.382 --> 00:34:45.850 line:95%,end
Jeff,

00:34:46.784 --> 00:34:48.686 line:95%,end
I was belligerent.

00:34:48.753 --> 00:34:52.256 line:95%,end
- I was beat by a little purse.
- By a man.

00:34:52.323 --> 00:34:54.258 line:95%,end
And then I called my mom.

00:34:56.494 --> 00:34:59.797 line:95%,end
Could you imagine her poor mother
on the other end of the phone?

00:34:59.864 --> 00:35:02.233 line:95%,end
How many times has she's said,
save your tears for your pillow

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:04.168 line:95%,end
to our seven-year-olds.

00:35:04.235 --> 00:35:07.238 line:95%,end
And she's, like, 150, like, my mom.

00:35:07.305 --> 00:35:09.073 line:95%,end
- My mom.
KELLY: I'm calling my mom.

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:12.410 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Mom! [inaudible] there's a boy,
and he made me cry.

00:35:12.477 --> 00:35:16.981 line:95%,end
Abby, when she cries-- I don't know
if it's real tears,

00:35:17.048 --> 00:35:19.617 line:95%,end
but it's a little bit like
she has to think about it,

00:35:19.684 --> 00:35:22.553 line:95%,end
and then it's like, dead puppies,
dead puppies, dead puppies.

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:24.088 line:95%,end
Oh, that was so wrong.

00:35:24.155 --> 00:35:27.725 line:95%,end
Watching Cathy cry truly is like
watching the Wicked Witch cry.

00:35:28.459 --> 00:35:30.094 line:95%,end
You think she's going to melt?

00:35:30.161 --> 00:35:34.232 line:95%,end
Everyone else I believe has
some sort of like feeling going on,

00:35:34.298 --> 00:35:38.269 line:95%,end
but watching Cathy cry is seriously,
like, I'll get you my pretty.

00:35:38.336 --> 00:35:39.637 line:95%,end
[sad cackle]

00:35:39.704 --> 00:35:41.906 line:95%,end
Why is Cathy a-- why is Cathy a--

00:35:41.973 --> 00:35:44.075 line:95%,end
Why is Cathy a witch
and Abby's not a witch?

00:35:44.142 --> 00:35:47.612 line:95%,end
Because anybody who wears
a golden retriever as a coat is a witch.

00:35:50.248 --> 00:35:52.617 line:95%,end
Which of the girls is the biggest crybaby?

00:35:54.719 --> 00:35:55.720 line:95%,end
- I think that's--
- Oh.

00:35:55.786 --> 00:35:57.021 line:95%,end
I don't know if that's a fair question,
but--

00:35:57.088 --> 00:35:59.323 line:95%,end
- Well, I think it depends on the week.
JEFF: Any of the children, though.

00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:01.192 line:95%,end
Do any of the kids use crying as a way--

00:36:01.259 --> 00:36:03.861 line:95%,end
Who throws their kids under the bus?
I don't.

00:36:03.928 --> 00:36:05.997 line:95%,end
- I'm going to say none.
JEFF: None of the girls.

00:36:06.063 --> 00:36:07.431 line:95%,end
Oh, Kaya raised her hand.

00:36:07.498 --> 00:36:08.866 line:95%,end
LISA: Kaya wants to throw
somebody under the bus.

00:36:08.933 --> 00:36:09.800 line:95%,end
JEFF: Who's a crybaby?

00:36:09.867 --> 00:36:12.436 line:95%,end
If you say Chloe,
I'm pulling out your weave.

00:36:12.503 --> 00:36:16.574 line:95%,end
You got one more weave threat today, okay.
I don't play about my weave.

00:36:16.641 --> 00:36:19.944 line:95%,end
- I do not play about my weave.
- --Chloe, I'm pulling out your weave.

00:36:21.846 --> 00:36:27.485 line:95%,end
I think Chloe cries a little too much,
and I think Paige cries, too.

00:36:27.552 --> 00:36:29.787 line:95%,end
- Paige! Really?
KAYA: Yeah.

00:36:29.854 --> 00:36:32.557 line:95%,end
I change my answer, it is Kendall.
She's the crybaby.

00:36:32.623 --> 00:36:35.993 line:95%,end
Don't tell her mom I said that.
She's a crybaby.

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:38.629 line:95%,end
I would cry, too, if my mom
dressed like that, I mean--

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:41.799 line:95%,end
Can I get an amen?

00:36:43.601 --> 00:36:46.337 line:95%,end
- So what do you girls think?
- I'm going to go with Kendall.

00:36:46.404 --> 00:36:51.175 line:95%,end
Look, I would say that
I think Maddie cries.

00:36:51.242 --> 00:36:53.611 line:95%,end
I remember Maddie crying more,

00:36:53.678 --> 00:36:56.914 line:95%,end
but I think because when Maddie
cries it's very dramatic.

00:36:56.981 --> 00:36:59.784 line:95%,end
They're are the tears of a real dancer.

00:37:00.351 --> 00:37:02.053 line:95%,end
- Dead puppies.
- So, I think-- yes.

00:37:02.119 --> 00:37:04.155 line:95%,end
- Dead puppies.
JEFF: Those are tears from the theater.

00:37:04.222 --> 00:37:06.290 line:95%,end
Yes, they're theater tears!
That's what it is.

00:37:06.357 --> 00:37:08.693 line:95%,end
So when Maddie cries,
it just sticks in my brain.

00:37:08.759 --> 00:37:11.596 line:95%,end
Well I'm going to ask our guests.
I'm playing the role of Dr. Phil today.


00:37:11.662 --> 00:37:13.164 line:95%,end
Oh, Dr. Phil.

00:37:13.231 --> 00:37:14.098 line:95%,end
KELLY: Why don't we just
call you Dr. Collins?

00:37:14.165 --> 00:37:16.400 line:95%,end
- Do you just want to give us an exam?
JEFF: As you know--

00:37:16.467 --> 00:37:18.936 line:95%,end
JEFF: As you know, so many lessons,
so many lessons are learned

00:37:19.003 --> 00:37:21.472 line:95%,end
from watching Dance Moms. Can you ladies
wrap it up please, and tell us

00:37:21.539 --> 00:37:24.041 line:95%,end
what lessons you've learned
that you've applied to your own live?

00:37:24.108 --> 00:37:26.377 line:95%,end
Well, after that last conversation-- gosh.

00:37:26.444 --> 00:37:32.049 line:95%,end
I have learned that there is no more
dramatic exit than to say,

00:37:32.116 --> 00:37:34.051 line:95%,end
"That's it. I'm done."

00:37:34.885 --> 00:37:36.420 line:95%,end
LISA: That's the most important lesson.
- Amen.

00:37:36.487 --> 00:37:38.055 line:95%,end
LISA: Thank you. Thank you.
- Amen.

00:37:38.122 --> 00:37:39.557 line:95%,end
You're done.

00:37:40.358 --> 00:37:42.760 line:95%,end
And how about you? What life lessons have
you learned that you're applying

00:37:42.827 --> 00:37:44.895 line:95%,end
to your own life that are making you
a better person?

00:37:44.962 --> 00:37:47.331 line:95%,end
I've learned that no matter
what you wear,

00:37:47.398 --> 00:37:50.167 line:95%,end
and no matter what anybody says about you,

00:37:50.234 --> 00:37:55.306 line:95%,end
you can still keep dressing terribly
day after day.

00:37:55.373 --> 00:37:56.874 line:95%,end
Hey!

00:37:58.643 --> 00:38:01.479 line:95%,end
- Kaya, what have you learned?
- Not a damn thing.

00:38:02.046 --> 00:38:05.049 line:95%,end
I haven't.
I've learned how to argue more with--

00:38:05.116 --> 00:38:07.485 line:95%,end
with other women.
I haven't learned a thing.

00:38:08.419 --> 00:38:10.354 line:95%,end
You are welcome.

00:38:11.355 --> 00:38:14.558 line:95%,end
What is Chloe learning from all this? What
do you think she'll take away from it?

00:38:14.625 --> 00:38:17.862 line:95%,end
I think Chloe, as well as,

00:38:17.928 --> 00:38:20.464 line:95%,end
I think Paige is in the same boat
as Chloe--

00:38:20.531 --> 00:38:24.268 line:95%,end
I think that they are learning that
no one's going to hold them down.

00:38:24.335 --> 00:38:27.138 line:95%,end
I do. No one has told them
that they can do it,

00:38:27.204 --> 00:38:30.808 line:95%,end
they've all been told
that they're not good enough.

00:38:30.875 --> 00:38:33.077 line:95%,end
And something my dad has always told me,

00:38:33.144 --> 00:38:36.781 line:95%,end
that something that is benefiting my girl

00:38:36.847 --> 00:38:38.683 line:95%,end
is that--

00:38:40.384 --> 00:38:42.420 line:95%,end
--you're never going to win everything.

00:38:42.486 --> 00:38:44.755 line:95%,end
KELLY: There's always
somebody better out there.

00:38:44.822 --> 00:38:46.557 line:95%,end
And, you know what,

00:38:46.624 --> 00:38:51.362 line:95%,end
you're going out there and you're learning
how to be a good loser.

00:38:51.429 --> 00:38:54.965 line:95%,end
I believe that those kids are the ones who
will end up being the most successful.

00:38:55.032 --> 00:38:56.701 line:95%,end
I believe that the kids,
when they're really young

00:38:56.767 --> 00:38:59.704 line:95%,end
and they're told you're brilliant,
you're beautiful, you're always winning.

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:02.340 line:95%,end
I really do believe it's the underdog
that, in the end--

00:39:02.406 --> 00:39:05.576 line:95%,end
- Absolutely.
JEFF: So you were making that point.

00:39:05.643 --> 00:39:08.312 line:95%,end
- Absolutely.
- It's easy to win.

00:39:08.379 --> 00:39:10.448 line:95%,end
It's hard to lose and persevere.

00:39:10.514 --> 00:39:13.217 line:95%,end
And I always say that to Melissa.
I always say, you know what,

00:39:13.284 --> 00:39:17.455 line:95%,end
Maddie's always used to winning,
what happens when she loses?

00:39:17.521 --> 00:39:20.424 line:95%,end
You know, how is she going to handle that?

00:39:20.491 --> 00:39:22.059 line:95%,end
Or, what happens when she just gets bored?

00:39:22.126 --> 00:39:27.865 line:95%,end
Exactly. You know-- I mean,
Paige is used to not winning.

00:39:27.932 --> 00:39:33.070 line:95%,end
And she's fine with that,
and she's happy for her friends winning.

00:39:33.137 --> 00:39:38.309 line:95%,end
And I don't know that Maddie can handle
her friends winning and her losing.

00:39:38.376 --> 00:39:40.745 line:95%,end
I don't know that Maddie can handle that.

00:39:40.811 --> 00:39:42.413 line:95%,end
All right, well, that's
about all we have time for.

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:44.448 line:95%,end
I want to say a big thank
you to our dance moms

00:39:44.515 --> 00:39:47.952 line:95%,end
Christi and Kelly, Kaya.

00:39:48.319 --> 00:39:51.088 line:95%,end
To our comedians, Nadine and Lisa,
thank you so much.

00:39:51.155 --> 00:39:53.124 line:95%,end
You guys have been fantastic.
I'm Jeff Collins.

00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:55.292 line:95%,end
And this has been Dance Moms Chatter.

00:39:55.359 --> 00:39:58.829 line:95%,end
Join us next time for more dirt,
more dish, and much more drama,

00:39:58.896 --> 00:40:01.365 line:95%,end
and that will be Dance Moms style.

00:40:02.133 --> 00:40:04.135 line:95%,end
[cheering]

00:40:07.605 --> 00:40:08.706 line:5%,start
NARRATOR: Next time--

00:40:08.773 --> 00:40:12.510 line:5%,start
There's a rumor that you
and the bus driver are doing it.

00:40:12.576 --> 00:40:14.445 line:5%,start
I'm the boss,
and that's all there is to it.

00:40:14.512 --> 00:40:17.281 line:5%,start
I think Holly probably
has the biggest butt.

00:40:17.348 --> 00:40:20.751 line:5%,start
We see each other a lot, you know, naked.

00:40:20.818 --> 00:40:22.253 line:5%,start
Who do you think dresses
the worst on the show?

00:40:22.319 --> 00:40:22.987 line:5%,start
Kelly.

00:40:23.053 --> 00:40:25.222 line:5%,start
How do you manage to teach an entire class
without ever moving?

00:40:26.257 --> 00:40:28.492 line:5%,start
I believe that every child should dance.

00:40:28.559 --> 00:40:30.194 line:5%,start
Melissa needed to be taught a lesson.

00:40:30.261 --> 00:40:32.163 line:5%,start
You are unmovable.

00:40:32.229 --> 00:40:34.265 line:5%,start
I went right to the police station.
