ABBY LEE (VOICE OVER):
Previously on "Dance Moms."

00:00:02.535 --> 00:00:05.538 line:5%,start
It's the same choreography,
exactly to the T.

00:00:05.605 --> 00:00:06.840 line:5%,start
KELLY: It's never
happened before.

00:00:06.906 --> 00:00:08.174 line:5%,start
She's not letting
them watch each other.

00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:11.411 line:5%,start
Melissa will lose her [bleep]
if both of her kids lose.

00:00:11.478 --> 00:00:13.747 line:5%,start
You ruined your entire number.

00:00:13.813 --> 00:00:16.116 line:5%,start
In the first place,
Too Hot to Handle.

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:17.350 line:5%,start
[cheers and applause]

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:20.687 line:5%,start
One of our judges,
they gave Chloe a 99.10.

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:22.689 line:5%,start
She actually had a 96.6.

00:00:22.756 --> 00:00:26.092 line:5%,start
That means that the overall
winner would have been Maddie.

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:27.761 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: You're
lying. You're lying!

00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:28.962 line:5%,start
[bleep] you.

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.530 line:5%,start
You know nothing!

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:32.532 line:5%,start
ABBY LEE (VOICE OVER):
Coming up on "Dance Moms."

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.735 line:5%,start
All of you had the opportunity
to come and see me in LA.

00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:36.936 line:5%,start
Maddie came out.

00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:39.639 line:5%,start
We made an agreement about
what we're going to do with the
girls.

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:41.508 line:5%,start
We all stood by
that, and you didn't.

00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:42.642 line:5%,start
I know, storm out--

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:44.911 line:5%,start
Oh, I am storming out,
because this is not being
brought up.

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:46.379 line:5%,start
- CHRISTI: Feel me!
- MELISSA: Screw you!

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:48.815 line:5%,start
Melissa, she doesn't
know what she's doing.

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:50.717 line:5%,start
No more recess!

00:00:50.784 --> 00:00:52.285 line:5%,start
I want to see your character.

00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:55.455 line:5%,start
Maybe just one of you
will be gone to soon.

00:00:55.522 --> 00:00:57.657 line:5%,start
Maddie's upset.
Maddie's upset, so don't play
the game.

00:00:57.724 --> 00:00:59.893 line:5%,start
I'm done. I'm so over it!

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:02.395 line:95%,end
[theme music]

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:06.566 line:95%,end
Get up, get on the floor.

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:09.469 line:95%,end
My world is with my girls.

00:01:09.536 --> 00:01:11.671 line:95%,end
Living on the dance floor.

00:01:12.305 --> 00:01:14.841 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.380 line:5%,start
ABBY LEE: Come on, let's go!
Move it, move it, move it! Let's
go!

00:01:20.447 --> 00:01:21.581 line:95%,end
Come on, guys.

00:01:22.816 --> 00:01:23.950 line:95%,end
Come on, everybody.

00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:26.953 line:95%,end
So did you miss me?

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.822 line:95%,end
GIRLS: Yes.

00:01:29.322 --> 00:01:30.790 line:95%,end
- Really?
- GIRLS: Yes.

00:01:30.857 --> 00:01:32.225 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: Okay.
You guys, I missed.

00:01:32.292 --> 00:01:33.793 line:95%,end
I missed all of
my students here.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.062 line:95%,end
However, the moms, not so much.

00:01:37.964 --> 00:01:40.967 line:95%,end
So while you guys
were in the studio--

00:01:41.034 --> 00:01:45.572 line:95%,end
well, some of you were in the
studio practicing, learning,
training.

00:01:45.872 --> 00:01:48.541 line:95%,end
I was doing "Abby's
Dance Competition."

00:01:48.608 --> 00:01:51.244 line:5%,start
I was in California
learning new things.

00:01:51.311 --> 00:01:55.215 line:5%,start
I was bettering myself
as a teacher and a
choreographer.

00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:58.952 line:95%,end
All of you had the opportunity
to come and see me in LA.

00:01:59.018 --> 00:02:00.253 line:95%,end
Maddie came out.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.524 line:95%,end
You worked with the kids,
and you performed a new solo.

00:02:07.427 --> 00:02:09.229 line:95%,end
- Did you have a good time?
- Yes.

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:10.730 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: Yes.

00:02:11.431 --> 00:02:14.033 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Over break,
all the moms made a pact that
none of us

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.536 line:95%,end
would send our girls to Abby's
West Coast competition because
of the way

00:02:16.603 --> 00:02:17.804 line:95%,end
she treats the girls.

00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:20.607 line:5%,start
And when the whole
judging mishap took place,

00:02:20.673 --> 00:02:22.375 line:5%,start
she handled that terribly.

00:02:22.442 --> 00:02:24.077 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: I'm anxious
to get started.

00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:25.678 line:95%,end
I want to see what
all you've learned.

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:27.780 line:95%,end
And I've checked the roll books.

00:02:27.847 --> 00:02:32.385 line:95%,end
I know who has been in class,
and I know who hasn't been in
class.

00:02:32.452 --> 00:02:33.753 line:95%,end
Let's go through the pyramid.

00:02:34.654 --> 00:02:36.089 line:95%,end
We can all remember back then.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.024 line:95%,end
Brooke.

00:02:38.925 --> 00:02:41.728 line:95%,end
Brooke, the faculty here
didn't see too much of you

00:02:41.794 --> 00:02:43.096 line:95%,end
while I was away.

00:02:44.097 --> 00:02:48.434 line:95%,end
I was recording a CD,
so I was gone all week too.

00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:50.970 line:5%,start
Brooke is very passionate
about her singing.

00:02:51.037 --> 00:02:54.307 line:5%,start
And over the break,
we decided to record a CD for
her.

00:02:54.374 --> 00:02:56.609 line:95%,end
And I just feel like
Abby should be happy

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:57.744 line:95%,end
that Brooke is doing this.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.179 line:95%,end
And instead, we come back,
and she puts her

00:02:59.245 --> 00:03:00.346 line:5%,start
at the bottom of the pyramid.

00:03:01.381 --> 00:03:03.850 line:5%,start
Paige, do you feel
that you've improved?

00:03:05.151 --> 00:03:06.719 line:95%,end
Yeah, I think my turns
have been getting better,

00:03:06.786 --> 00:03:08.655 line:95%,end
because we've had
normal classes,

00:03:08.721 --> 00:03:11.791 line:95%,end
so that I've been able
to work on them more.

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:14.394 line:5%,start
ABBY LEE: And next,
we have Kendall.

00:03:15.295 --> 00:03:17.330 line:95%,end
Kendall, do you think
you've been improving?

00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:19.299 line:95%,end
Yes.

00:03:19.365 --> 00:03:20.700 line:95%,end
I have a private with
James every week,

00:03:20.767 --> 00:03:21.768 line:95%,end
and he works on my turns.

00:03:21.834 --> 00:03:24.003 line:95%,end
And he says that they're
getting much better.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.305 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: Okay.

00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:27.273 line:5%,start
And Nia.

00:03:28.274 --> 00:03:29.342 line:95%,end
What about you?

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:31.544 line:95%,end
I've been taking four extra
classes every single week.

00:03:31.611 --> 00:03:33.746 line:95%,end
I think that's great.

00:03:33.813 --> 00:03:34.847 line:95%,end
Good for you.

00:03:34.914 --> 00:03:36.649 line:95%,end
Nice to hear that.

00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:39.185 line:5%,start
It's a refreshing change
to have Abby say something

00:03:39.252 --> 00:03:42.222 line:5%,start
nice and positive
about Nia's dance training.

00:03:42.288 --> 00:03:44.224 line:5%,start
But unfortunately,
Nia is still at the bottom

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.325 line:5%,start
of Abby's pyramid.

00:03:45.391 --> 00:03:48.728 line:5%,start
ABBY LEE: Moving up
we have, Mackenzie.

00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:51.698 line:5%,start
Mackenzie, you didn't win.

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:53.600 line:95%,end
You let Asia beat you.

00:03:53.666 --> 00:03:56.069 line:95%,end
In first place,
Too Hot to Handle.

00:03:56.135 --> 00:03:58.238 line:95%,end
[cheers and applause]

00:03:58.304 --> 00:03:59.839 line:95%,end
It's this.


00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:01.941 line:95%,end
And it's that confidence.

00:04:02.008 --> 00:04:03.710 line:95%,end
You let your face go blank.

00:04:03.776 --> 00:04:04.777 line:95%,end
Are you cute?

00:04:04.844 --> 00:04:06.079 line:95%,end
Yes.

00:04:06.145 --> 00:04:07.814 line:95%,end
But you're getting
a little too old for cute.

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:10.683 line:95%,end
I'm going to really push
Mackenzie hard this week.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.786 line:95%,end
If she's going to beat Asia,
she has to do what it takes.

00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:16.589 line:95%,end
And now, Chloe.

00:04:16.656 --> 00:04:19.058 line:95%,end
You had a great performance.

00:04:19.125 --> 00:04:21.828 line:95%,end
You went out on stage,
you looked beautiful,

00:04:21.894 --> 00:04:25.098 line:95%,end
your mom was beaming,
they announced you as the
winner.

00:04:25.465 --> 00:04:28.601 line:95%,end
EMCEE: Entry number 19
from Abby Lee Dance Company, You
Can!

00:04:29.002 --> 00:04:30.670 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: The scores
were not right.

00:04:30.737 --> 00:04:32.605 line:95%,end
You did not win,
you were second.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.907 line:95%,end
Did you dance beautifully?

00:04:34.974 --> 00:04:36.009 line:95%,end
Yes.

00:04:36.075 --> 00:04:38.311 line:95%,end
But you have to work
on your technique.

00:04:38.378 --> 00:04:40.947 line:95%,end
Abby would rather go on a diet
than say that Chloe deserved

00:04:41.014 --> 00:04:42.315 line:95%,end
to be at the top of the pyramid.

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:46.019 line:95%,end
And next, we have Asia.

00:04:46.085 --> 00:04:47.954 line:95%,end
Now, Asia is not here.

00:04:48.021 --> 00:04:50.123 line:95%,end
Asia will be back in
pyramid next week.

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:53.259 line:5%,start
And on top of the
pyramid, we have Maddie.

00:04:53.359 --> 00:04:54.394 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:04:54.494 --> 00:04:56.129 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE:
Congratulations, Maddie.

00:04:56.195 --> 00:04:58.398 line:95%,end
You gave a flawless performance.

00:04:58.464 --> 00:05:00.099 line:95%,end
And when they announced
Chloe as the winner,

00:05:00.166 --> 00:05:01.234 line:95%,end
you didn't even flinch.

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:03.736 line:95%,end
You were thrilled
for your classmate.

00:05:04.504 --> 00:05:09.242 line:95%,end
This week, you will be
traveling to Syracuse, New York.

00:05:09.842 --> 00:05:12.845 line:95%,end
The competition
is In10sity Dance.

00:05:12.912 --> 00:05:15.515 line:95%,end
Now, this week's assignments.

00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:17.784 line:95%,end
Maddie, you will be
doing a top solo.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.787 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:05:20.853 --> 00:05:22.255 line:5%,start
Maddie's solo this week is tap,

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:23.823 line:5%,start
and she's going
to be so amazing,

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:25.758 line:5%,start
because she's a
phenomenal tap dancer.

00:05:25.825 --> 00:05:28.795 line:95%,end
Mackenzie, you will also
be doing a solo this week.

00:05:28.861 --> 00:05:30.463 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.465 line:95%,end
You will not be
performing with the group.

00:05:32.532 --> 00:05:35.935 line:95%,end
You will be doing a straight
acrobatic gymnastic routine.

00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:39.572 line:5%,start
This is your last shot
before Asia gets back.

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:41.908 line:5%,start
Abby's pushing me to dance more
like Maddie

00:05:41.974 --> 00:05:44.477 line:5%,start
and the big kids,
but I think I can do it.

00:05:44.544 --> 00:05:47.013 line:95%,end
I have one more
solo to give out.

00:05:51.417 --> 00:05:53.986 line:95%,end
And due to what
happened last time,

00:05:54.053 --> 00:05:56.456 line:95%,end
that solo will go to Chloe.

00:05:56.522 --> 00:05:59.525 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:05:59.926 --> 00:06:04.097 line:95%,end
I know that it's unfortunate,
the whole Maddie-Chloe solo
thing.

00:06:04.163 --> 00:06:05.598 line:95%,end
Mistakes happen.

00:06:05.665 --> 00:06:07.767 line:95%,end
I'm giving Chloe
another opportunity

00:06:07.834 --> 00:06:09.569 line:95%,end
to go right up against Maddie.

00:06:09.635 --> 00:06:12.772 line:95%,end
Chloe, you better start
concentrating on your hip-hop,

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:14.307 line:95%,end
because it is hip-hop.

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:17.009 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Abby gave
Maddie a top solo,

00:06:17.076 --> 00:06:18.978 line:95%,end
which, clearly,
Maddie excels in tap.

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:20.813 line:95%,end
She's had tap classes for years.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.282 line:95%,end
And she assigns Chloe hip-hop,
which we don't even have

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:24.784 line:95%,end
hip-hop classes at the studio.

00:06:24.851 --> 00:06:26.386 line:95%,end
She's so unfair.

00:06:26.452 --> 00:06:30.556 line:95%,end
The group routine is
called Gone Too Soon.

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:34.794 line:95%,end
And of course, we're referring
to all those Hollywood
tragedies.

00:06:35.661 --> 00:06:38.431 line:95%,end
Nia, you will portray
Whitney Houston.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:45.638 line:95%,end
Kendall, I want to see
the sass and spunk of Selena.

00:06:46.739 --> 00:06:50.243 line:95%,end
Sorry, Kendall,
you are not playing Selena
Gomez.

00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:54.680 line:95%,end
I'm talking about
the Grammy-winning Latin artist,
Selena.

00:06:55.214 --> 00:06:58.651 line:95%,end
Brooke will be inspired
by Amy Winehouse.

00:06:59.786 --> 00:07:01.020 line:95%,end
Ah!

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:03.790 line:95%,end
Paige, Anna Nicole Smith.

00:07:03.856 --> 00:07:06.259 line:95%,end
JILL: Ooh!

00:07:06.526 --> 00:07:11.431 line:95%,end
Your buddy, Chloe,
will portray Marilyn Monroe.

00:07:11.497 --> 00:07:13.332 line:95%,end
No! That's not fair!

00:07:15.201 --> 00:07:19.372 line:95%,end
And Maddie,
who else is there but Princess
Di?

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:20.840 line:95%,end
Ooh, I love her.

00:07:21.674 --> 00:07:23.309 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: All right. You can go.

00:07:23.376 --> 00:07:24.510 line:95%,end
Girls, spread apart.

00:07:24.577 --> 00:07:26.879 line:5%,start
[music playing]

00:07:30.616 --> 00:07:31.617 line:5%,start
Let's go from the top.

00:07:31.684 --> 00:07:33.352 line:5%,start
Let's see what we have.
Let's all dance it. Hit it!

00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:34.654 line:5%,start
I hear echoes inside myself.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:35.721 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: Come on, push.

00:07:35.788 --> 00:07:37.924 line:95%,end
Get in the ball of that foot,
right off the floor.

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:40.393 line:95%,end
One, two, three, four, five.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.528 line:95%,end
Yay! Good girl!

00:07:42.595 --> 00:07:46.432 line:95%,end
This week, the routine
is entitled Gone Too Soon.

00:07:47.066 --> 00:07:49.235 line:95%,end
This is a contemporary routine.

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:54.273 line:95%,end
It has very intricate timing,
and it's also characterization.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:57.710 line:95%,end
These girls need to become one
with their character.

00:07:57.777 --> 00:08:00.613 line:95%,end
And they better bring it on,
because everybody


00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.949 line:95%,end
in that audience,
including the judges,

00:08:03.015 --> 00:08:05.585 line:95%,end
needs to easily recognize
their character.

00:08:05.651 --> 00:08:07.386 line:95%,end
I got to let you go
in a few minutes.

00:08:07.453 --> 00:08:08.921 line:95%,end
I want to not keep
choreographing.

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:09.989 line:95%,end
I want to go over the story.

00:08:10.056 --> 00:08:13.693 line:95%,end
You need to tell the audience
and the judges

00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:16.362 line:95%,end
they shouldn't know
who you are because of the
costume.

00:08:16.429 --> 00:08:17.797 line:95%,end
They should know
who you are

00:08:17.864 --> 00:08:19.332 line:95%,end
because you're
telling the story.

00:08:19.398 --> 00:08:20.399 line:95%,end
Do your homework.

00:08:20.466 --> 00:08:22.969 line:95%,end
Look on the internet, Google it.
Figure it out.

00:08:23.035 --> 00:08:26.272 line:95%,end
Or maybe just one of you will be
gone too soon

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:27.607 line:95%,end
from the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:08:28.808 --> 00:08:30.343 line:95%,end
KELLY: But what shall
we have Abby be?

00:08:30.409 --> 00:08:32.278 line:95%,end
Well, who can Abby be?

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:34.146 line:95%,end
Who's the woman who has the
snakes coming out of her head?

00:08:34.247 --> 00:08:35.248 line:95%,end
Medusa!

00:08:35.314 --> 00:08:36.782 line:95%,end
- JILL: Oh, no, Nefertiti.
- Ursula!

00:08:36.849 --> 00:08:38.518 line:95%,end
- Ursula! She's Ursula.
- The sea witch.

00:08:38.584 --> 00:08:41.420 line:95%,end
Oh. Ursula was the octopus.

00:08:41.487 --> 00:08:42.522 line:95%,end
The big black--

00:08:42.588 --> 00:08:45.625 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: She wears black and she
steals little beautiful
children's talent.

00:08:45.691 --> 00:08:46.692 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Isn't she?
Yes. She's Ursula.

00:08:46.759 --> 00:08:47.927 line:95%,end
HOLLY: She's a cartoon.
She's not real.

00:08:47.994 --> 00:08:50.663 line:95%,end
And she keeps it in a
jar around her neck.

00:08:51.264 --> 00:08:52.965 line:95%,end
- CHRISTI: She steals talent.
- JILL: She's Ursula.

00:08:53.032 --> 00:08:54.834 line:95%,end
She is Ursula.

00:08:54.901 --> 00:08:56.869 line:95%,end
JILL: Oh, golly.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:59.438 line:5%,start
ABBY LEE: Hello.
Are you ready for hip-hop?

00:09:00.439 --> 00:09:01.474 line:5%,start
Yes?

00:09:01.541 --> 00:09:02.675 line:95%,end
Is Payton teaching her?

00:09:03.676 --> 00:09:07.179 line:95%,end
Now, remember, the story
is if you want to be a
celebrity,

00:09:07.246 --> 00:09:09.081 line:95%,end
you want to be a pop star,
you want to move to LA

00:09:09.148 --> 00:09:13.219 line:5%,start
and do all these things,
you better be able to be a hip
-hop dancer.

00:09:14.453 --> 00:09:16.489 line:5%,start
[music playing]

00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:20.826 line:95%,end
So Chloe is doing a hip-hop
routine entitled beautiful.

00:09:20.893 --> 00:09:24.830 line:95%,end
It's more of a jazz routine
with hip-hop elements,

00:09:24.897 --> 00:09:27.199 line:95%,end
hip-hop costume, hip-hop style.

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:30.703 line:95%,end
I want her to succeed
with this hip-hop routine.

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:32.338 line:95%,end
And I'm bringing Payton in.

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:34.941 line:95%,end
Because when Peyton hits
hip-hop, she hits it hard.

00:09:37.543 --> 00:09:40.079 line:95%,end
KELLY: I think Chloe should say
to her, why am I doing hip-hop?

00:09:40.146 --> 00:09:42.014 line:95%,end
I'm not a hip-hopper. Whatever.

00:09:42.081 --> 00:09:44.517 line:95%,end
Again, this is just a way
to humiliate Chloe.

00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:45.818 line:95%,end
Sometimes, this
is the best dance,

00:09:45.885 --> 00:09:47.286 line:95%,end
because there's no pressure.

00:09:47.353 --> 00:09:49.121 line:95%,end
You know you're
not going to win?

00:09:50.022 --> 00:09:51.824 line:95%,end
So you go out there,
and have fun, and you enjoy.

00:09:51.891 --> 00:09:52.925 line:95%,end
Holly, is that
what you're saying?

00:09:53.025 --> 00:09:54.994 line:95%,end
You say Chloe is not
going to win with hip-hop?

00:09:55.061 --> 00:09:57.296 line:95%,end
They tend to be
very competitive.

00:09:57.363 --> 00:10:00.833 line:95%,end
It's so clear that Abby
only thinks of Maddie as her
star,

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:02.902 line:95%,end
that Chloe is not allowed
to come anywhere near that.

00:10:02.969 --> 00:10:06.005 line:95%,end
That's why Maddie got tap this
week, and Chloe got hip-hop.

00:10:06.072 --> 00:10:07.907 line:95%,end
You need to isolate
this movement.

00:10:07.974 --> 00:10:10.910 line:95%,end
The isolation, the
shoulder, the rib cage.

00:10:10.977 --> 00:10:12.078 line:95%,end
That's what hip-hop is.

00:10:12.144 --> 00:10:15.147 line:95%,end
That's why a lot of people,
trained beautiful dancers

00:10:15.214 --> 00:10:17.249 line:95%,end
can't do it, because it's that
sudden change of direction.

00:10:17.583 --> 00:10:20.152 line:95%,end
Believe me, I was sitting
next to the guru of hip-hop,

00:10:20.219 --> 00:10:21.487 line:95%,end
and I learned something.

00:10:21.554 --> 00:10:23.356 line:95%,end
Maybe if you would
have come out to LA,

00:10:23.422 --> 00:10:24.557 line:95%,end
you would have
learned something too.

00:10:26.025 --> 00:10:29.428 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: You know what? I think
is really sad is that you point
-blank said

00:10:29.495 --> 00:10:32.031 line:95%,end
to all of us
that when the children were
invited

00:10:32.098 --> 00:10:35.334 line:95%,end
that you were not going to send
Maddie, but then you screwed the
group.

00:10:35.401 --> 00:10:38.137 line:95%,end
We made agreement about
what we were going to do with
the girls.

00:10:38.204 --> 00:10:40.406 line:95%,end
We all stood by
that, and you didn't.

00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:43.643 line:95%,end
Melissa, if I would have
disobeyed the group,

00:10:43.709 --> 00:10:45.444 line:95%,end
and went, and had Brooke do it--

00:10:45.511 --> 00:10:47.079 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Brooke would be
in much better standing.

00:10:47.146 --> 00:10:49.181 line:95%,end
--Brooke wouldn't have been
at the bottom of the pyramid
this week,

00:10:49.248 --> 00:10:50.549 line:95%,end
I can guarantee you that.

00:10:50.616 --> 00:10:53.319 line:95%,end
But I didn't do that,
because I'm a team player.

00:10:53.386 --> 00:10:56.422 line:95%,end
You know what,
that's my choice as a mother.

00:10:56.489 --> 00:10:59.291 line:95%,end
So basically, your choice
as a mother is dance trumps all.

00:10:59.358 --> 00:11:00.893 line:95%,end
Just to be clear, sneaky.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.061 line:95%,end
[awkward chuckles]

00:11:02.128 --> 00:11:04.096 line:95%,end
- CHRISTI: Well--
- That's funny.

00:11:04.163 --> 00:11:05.197 line:95%,end
Why is that funny?

00:11:05.264 --> 00:11:07.166 line:95%,end
Because you know Christi sneaks
all the time. You've said it.

00:11:07.233 --> 00:11:09.201 line:95%,end
- No, I'm saying I wouldn't do
it. - MELISSA: Oh, okay.

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:12.171 line:95%,end
- What do I sneak about?
- What do you mean? You talk to
everybody.

00:11:12.705 --> 00:11:13.706 line:95%,end
Give me a break.

00:11:13.773 --> 00:11:15.441 line:95%,end
If you could sleep with Abby,
you would, and you know it.

00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:17.343 line:95%,end
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:19.812 line:95%,end
Well, that's how you tend
to get ahead in life, Melissa.

00:11:19.879 --> 00:11:21.180 line:95%,end
Oh, yeah, I sleep
with everybody.

00:11:21.247 --> 00:11:22.648 line:95%,end
You do, boss.

00:11:23.115 --> 00:11:24.550 line:95%,end
I've never slept with my boss.

00:11:24.617 --> 00:11:26.285 line:95%,end
Yes, you did. You married him.

00:11:26.352 --> 00:11:27.420 line:95%,end
Yes, I married Greg after--

00:11:27.486 --> 00:11:29.488 line:95%,end
Yeah, after you slept with him
and had an affair when he had a
wife.

00:11:29.555 --> 00:11:30.556 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I did not!

00:11:30.623 --> 00:11:31.657 line:95%,end
And you had a husband.
- Guess what?

00:11:31.724 --> 00:11:32.858 line:95%,end
I didn't sleep with him.

00:11:32.925 --> 00:11:33.926 line:95%,end
And don't start with
me again, Christi.

00:11:33.993 --> 00:11:34.994 line:95%,end
JILL: You know what?

00:11:35.061 --> 00:11:36.062 line:95%,end
I know, storm out.

00:11:36.128 --> 00:11:38.397 line:95%,end
Oh, I am storming out,
because this is not being
brought up.

00:11:38.464 --> 00:11:40.066 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Feel me.
MELISSA: Screw you.

00:11:40.132 --> 00:11:41.634 line:95%,end
I did not sleep with my boss.
You know what?

00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:43.069 line:95%,end
You want to play those games?

00:11:43.135 --> 00:11:44.136 line:95%,end
What's wrong?

00:11:44.236 --> 00:11:46.972 line:95%,end
JILL: She has to live
with the decisions she made.

00:11:47.039 --> 00:11:49.709 line:95%,end
Like I'm not going to sit up
here and make this easy on her.

00:11:49.775 --> 00:11:51.544 line:95%,end
She didn't make it easy
on any of those six little
girls.

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:52.611 line:95%,end
JILL: No, but--

00:11:52.678 --> 00:11:54.380 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: She knew
she had that coming.


00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:00.519 line:5%,start
[music playing]

00:12:05.324 --> 00:12:06.726 line:95%,end
- Hey, girls. How are you doing?
- MELISSA: Hey.

00:12:06.792 --> 00:12:08.194 line:95%,end
- Good.
- ABBY LEE: Good.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.429 line:95%,end
After yesterday's
blow out with Melissa

00:12:10.496 --> 00:12:11.564 line:5%,start
and all of the other moms,

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:13.432 line:5%,start
I'm not sure what's
really going on.

00:12:13.499 --> 00:12:15.367 line:95%,end
But I am going to get
to the bottom of it.

00:12:15.701 --> 00:12:17.670 line:95%,end
Nobody is going to
mess with Melissa.

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:23.409 line:95%,end
So what I need to know
is what happened yesterday.

00:12:24.143 --> 00:12:27.146 line:95%,end
Well, Christi starts
screaming that--

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.983 line:95%,end
about I sleep with everybody
to get my kids ahead.

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:32.651 line:95%,end
And I'm not taking crap like
that, Abby. I'm done.

00:12:32.718 --> 00:12:35.087 line:95%,end
- ABBY LEE: I'm sorry. That just
shows-- - That has nothing--

00:12:35.154 --> 00:12:36.155 line:95%,end
She's trash.

00:12:36.222 --> 00:12:37.223 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: --what she is.

00:12:37.857 --> 00:12:39.625 line:95%,end
Because she goes to that level.

00:12:39.692 --> 00:12:41.093 line:95%,end
But I don't--
I'm not like that.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.629 line:95%,end
I have lots of mean things
to say about her,

00:12:43.696 --> 00:12:46.532 line:5%,start
and I can't, because
that's not my makeup.

00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:48.367 line:5%,start
Christie fights
dirty, and I don't.

00:12:48.667 --> 00:12:51.370 line:95%,end
I think it's wrong,
and I'm not like her,

00:12:51.437 --> 00:12:52.805 line:95%,end
so I'm not going
to act like her.

00:12:52.872 --> 00:12:54.006 line:95%,end
I'm not white trash.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.508 line:95%,end
[chuckles]

00:12:55.574 --> 00:12:56.876 line:95%,end
Hello.

00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:01.046 line:95%,end
If I were a betting woman,

00:13:01.113 --> 00:13:05.651 line:5%,start
I would say that Melissa is
probably talking to Abby about
me.

00:13:05.951 --> 00:13:07.920 line:95%,end
If I'm the most exciting thing
that Abby and Melissa have

00:13:07.987 --> 00:13:10.790 line:95%,end
to talk about,
then they have a really, really
sad life.

00:13:11.123 --> 00:13:13.859 line:95%,end
If you feel that
you don't want to sit up there

00:13:13.926 --> 00:13:16.562 line:95%,end
and it's getting crazy,
come down and work the front
desk.

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:17.830 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Okay.
Come down and work at the store.

00:13:17.897 --> 00:13:19.999 line:95%,end
- MELISSA: I will.
- Or come and sit inside the
room.

00:13:20.332 --> 00:13:21.500 line:95%,end
I don't go for
parents in the room,

00:13:21.567 --> 00:13:24.170 line:95%,end
but if you can
just sit in the corner quietly,

00:13:24.236 --> 00:13:26.071 line:95%,end
or play the music,
or something, that's fine with
me.

00:13:26.138 --> 00:13:27.173 line:95%,end
Okay. That's fine.

00:13:27.239 --> 00:13:28.274 line:95%,end
- All righty?
- Yep, thank you.

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:29.575 line:95%,end
Okay.

00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:31.310 line:95%,end
I certainly wouldn't
want to sit with them.

00:13:31.877 --> 00:13:33.579 line:95%,end
So I invite her down
into the studio.

00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:35.381 line:95%,end
She should see what
Mackenzie's doing.

00:13:36.081 --> 00:13:38.517 line:5%,start
[music playing]

00:13:38.584 --> 00:13:42.488 line:5%,start
Mackenzie is doing an acrobatic
gymnastics routine entitled

00:13:42.555 --> 00:13:44.156 line:95%,end
California Adventure.

00:13:44.223 --> 00:13:45.758 line:95%,end
It's sassy and fun.

00:13:46.325 --> 00:13:47.993 line:95%,end
Split! It's a bigger split!

00:13:48.594 --> 00:13:52.231 line:95%,end
She does a whole lot of stuff
in this number.

00:13:52.298 --> 00:13:54.567 line:95%,end
She has to have the strength,
the proper technique,

00:13:54.633 --> 00:13:57.203 line:95%,end
and the stamina to get
through this routine.

00:13:57.770 --> 00:13:59.305 line:95%,end
You should be on a diagonal.

00:14:00.039 --> 00:14:02.641 line:95%,end
- Hi, Holly.
- Oh, hey, Hol.

00:14:02.708 --> 00:14:03.843 line:95%,end
Hello, ladies.

00:14:03.909 --> 00:14:05.144 line:95%,end
Did you see Melissa downstairs?

00:14:05.211 --> 00:14:07.346 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Of course,
Melissa's avoiding the
situation.

00:14:07.413 --> 00:14:08.581 line:95%,end
It's what she does.

00:14:08.647 --> 00:14:11.250 line:95%,end
She'd rather high downstairs
and kiss Abby's ass

00:14:11.317 --> 00:14:13.752 line:95%,end
than come upstairs and face
the music with the rest of us.

00:14:13.819 --> 00:14:16.355 line:95%,end
You know, she needs
to just admit what she did

00:14:16.422 --> 00:14:17.523 line:95%,end
and get over it.

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:19.225 line:95%,end
She had a meeting
with Abby when I walked in.

00:14:19.291 --> 00:14:20.993 line:95%,end
They were meeting in the store.

00:14:21.093 --> 00:14:22.127 line:95%,end
Oh, in store.

00:14:22.194 --> 00:14:23.195 line:95%,end
And they both went--

00:14:23.262 --> 00:14:24.330 line:95%,end
and I just kept on going.

00:14:24.396 --> 00:14:25.397 line:95%,end
Ah.

00:14:25.464 --> 00:14:27.266 line:95%,end
And she's not up here,
because, you know--

00:14:27.933 --> 00:14:32.238 line:95%,end
even though she was the one
who sent Maddie to dance for
Abby,

00:14:32.304 --> 00:14:35.341 line:95%,end
even though the teen
all agreed not to do it,

00:14:35.407 --> 00:14:38.043 line:95%,end
and she was wrong,
she's punishing all of us.

00:14:39.278 --> 00:14:40.412 line:95%,end
Own who you are.

00:14:40.479 --> 00:14:42.648 line:95%,end
Don't sit here and
say, I'm so nice,

00:14:42.715 --> 00:14:44.450 line:95%,end
and my daughters
are just amazing.

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:49.021 line:95%,end
You intentionally do things
to hurt the other kids

00:14:49.088 --> 00:14:50.322 line:95%,end
but then you claim
you're a team player.

00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:51.490 line:95%,end
You're not.

00:14:51.557 --> 00:14:52.791 line:95%,end
You know, when it comes to Abby,

00:14:52.858 --> 00:14:55.461 line:95%,end
she will do whatever
she wants her to.

00:14:55.527 --> 00:14:56.695 line:95%,end
Or getting Maddie a routine.

00:14:56.762 --> 00:14:59.665 line:95%,end
And you said, because she,
Abby, will catapult Maddie

00:14:59.732 --> 00:15:00.900 line:95%,end
and Mackenzie to stardom.

00:15:00.966 --> 00:15:02.735 line:95%,end
- CHRISTI: Well, but it's--
- That's what it's all about.

00:15:02.801 --> 00:15:04.370 line:95%,end
- CHRISTI: But it's--
- So there's never going to be a
chance--

00:15:04.436 --> 00:15:05.571 line:95%,end
But here's the thing.

00:15:06.138 --> 00:15:09.708 line:95%,end
You're teaching your kids
that you step on everyone

00:15:09.775 --> 00:15:12.378 line:95%,end
to get ahead, and that's not
a good lesson to teach your
kids.

00:15:12.444 --> 00:15:13.812 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: So let's
go from the top.

00:15:13.879 --> 00:15:15.814 line:95%,end
It has to be
bigger. It's boring.

00:15:16.248 --> 00:15:17.316 line:95%,end
Boring!

00:15:17.783 --> 00:15:19.251 line:95%,end
Mackenzie is not
looking too good.

00:15:19.885 --> 00:15:22.321 line:95%,end
Mackenzie walked
into this studio

00:15:22.388 --> 00:15:25.257 line:95%,end
sweaty and out of breath.

00:15:25.324 --> 00:15:26.592 line:95%,end
She walked in that way.

00:15:27.159 --> 00:15:29.094 line:95%,end
Usually, that's
how she walks out.

00:15:29.161 --> 00:15:30.162 line:95%,end
Cartwheel.

00:15:30.229 --> 00:15:31.497 line:95%,end
Cut, split, arch back.

00:15:32.231 --> 00:15:33.999 line:95%,end
Why do I have to
say that every time?

00:15:34.466 --> 00:15:37.403 line:95%,end
Cut, split, arch back! It's one
move. Dah-dah-dah-dah!

00:15:37.469 --> 00:15:38.537 line:95%,end
Asia isn't here.

00:15:38.604 --> 00:15:41.440 line:95%,end
This is Mackenzie's shot,
but she's not giving me

00:15:41.507 --> 00:15:42.541 line:95%,end
what I want.

00:15:42.608 --> 00:15:46.211 line:95%,end
Melissa, she doesn't know
what she's doing,

00:15:46.278 --> 00:15:48.914 line:95%,end
she's out of breath,
she can't remember one step

00:15:49.014 --> 00:15:50.115 line:95%,end
from the next.

00:15:50.182 --> 00:15:52.384 line:95%,end
No more recess!

00:15:52.751 --> 00:15:54.453 line:95%,end
Why were you sunburned
when you came in here?

00:15:54.753 --> 00:15:56.055 line:95%,end
Were you outside at recess?

00:15:56.355 --> 00:15:58.991 line:95%,end
Outside, running around,
playing all day--

00:15:59.058 --> 00:16:00.392 line:95%,end
- I know.
- ABBY LEE: --and now, she's
useless.

00:16:01.193 --> 00:16:02.828 line:95%,end
That's why these kids
need to be home-schooled.

00:16:02.895 --> 00:16:04.163 line:95%,end
It's ridiculous.

00:16:04.229 --> 00:16:06.031 line:95%,end
She is useless.

00:16:06.098 --> 00:16:07.166 line:95%,end
What are you supposed to say
when all the kids

00:16:07.232 --> 00:16:08.500 line:95%,end
go to the playground?

00:16:08.567 --> 00:16:09.868 line:95%,end
Sorry, my dance teacher
said no kick ball.

00:16:10.202 --> 00:16:12.338 line:95%,end
Abby doesn't want Mackenzie
to play during recess.

00:16:12.404 --> 00:16:14.073 line:95%,end
If it were up to Abby,
Mackenzie wouldn't be allowed

00:16:14.139 --> 00:16:15.307 line:95%,end
to have any friends at all.

00:16:15.374 --> 00:16:17.810 line:95%,end
Well, you know, just because
no one played with Abby at
recess,


00:16:17.876 --> 00:16:20.112 line:95%,end
doesn't mean she has to take it
out on poor little Mackenzie.

00:16:20.412 --> 00:16:24.783 line:95%,end
Why should Abby have any say-so
when Melissa's kids

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:25.918 line:95%,end
play with friends?

00:16:26.285 --> 00:16:28.087 line:95%,end
That's the whole reason
I send my kids to this school

00:16:28.153 --> 00:16:30.889 line:95%,end
is to have social interaction
with other children.

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:32.558 line:95%,end
But Melissa will do it,

00:16:32.624 --> 00:16:35.594 line:95%,end
and she'll pull her kid from
school, and not have her do
recess

00:16:35.661 --> 00:16:36.895 line:95%,end
because Abby said so.

00:16:37.196 --> 00:16:39.365 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: Straddle.
Not apron split, a straddle
split.

00:16:39.631 --> 00:16:40.699 line:95%,end
No, before the tag.

00:16:40.766 --> 00:16:42.468 line:95%,end
You're doing it different
every time you do it.

00:16:42.534 --> 00:16:44.803 line:95%,end
MELISSA: You know, I'm sitting
in there watching Mackenzie's
rehearsal.

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:46.038 line:95%,end
I'm not looking
at the other moms.

00:16:46.105 --> 00:16:47.139 line:95%,end
I'm looking at my daughter.

00:16:47.206 --> 00:16:48.240 line:95%,end
I can care less.

00:16:49.208 --> 00:16:50.342 line:95%,end
All right, you understand
what you're doing?

00:16:50.409 --> 00:16:51.510 line:95%,end
Yes?

00:16:51.577 --> 00:16:52.778 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: All right,
you're finished.

00:16:53.846 --> 00:16:55.180 line:95%,end
Melissa, you can go.

00:16:56.148 --> 00:16:57.883 line:95%,end
I think Melissa's coming up.

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:00.853 line:95%,end
[chuckles] Our gossip
is over, ladies.

00:17:00.919 --> 00:17:02.054 line:95%,end
[chuckles]

00:17:02.121 --> 00:17:03.822 line:95%,end
I'm through avoiding
the situation.

00:17:04.089 --> 00:17:06.425 line:95%,end
The moms can talk behind
my back all they want.

00:17:07.092 --> 00:17:08.260 line:95%,end
They're just going to
have to deal with it.

00:17:08.327 --> 00:17:09.595 line:95%,end
I did nothing wrong.

00:17:11.063 --> 00:17:12.431 line:95%,end
JILL: Oh, hello.

00:17:12.498 --> 00:17:13.599 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Hi.

00:17:14.033 --> 00:17:15.334 line:95%,end
How did it go?

00:17:15.401 --> 00:17:16.635 line:95%,end
HOLLY: What was
that about recess?

00:17:16.702 --> 00:17:17.770 line:95%,end
No recess.

00:17:17.836 --> 00:17:18.837 line:95%,end
All they do is play.

00:17:18.904 --> 00:17:20.439 line:95%,end
How does Abby know
what Mackenzie does?

00:17:20.506 --> 00:17:21.740 line:95%,end
Because she asked her.

00:17:21.807 --> 00:17:23.475 line:95%,end
And Mackenzie said, we
played outside all day today.

00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:25.177 line:95%,end
But what's wrong with that?

00:17:26.578 --> 00:17:29.281 line:95%,end
She has no-- she's tired,
and she's a mess.

00:17:29.348 --> 00:17:31.150 line:95%,end
I'm like, I don't think--
I thought she looked great.

00:17:31.583 --> 00:17:32.751 line:5%,start
Sorry, but--

00:17:33.118 --> 00:17:34.753 line:5%,start
You're certainly not
going to let Chloe,

00:17:35.387 --> 00:17:36.789 line:5%,start
doing a hip-hop dance, beat you.

00:17:37.523 --> 00:17:38.524 line:95%,end
Really?

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:40.459 line:95%,end
Maddie is doing a tap solo.

00:17:40.526 --> 00:17:41.827 line:95%,end
I am thrilled.

00:17:42.327 --> 00:17:44.830 line:95%,end
She's a great tapper,
it's a cute little number.

00:17:44.897 --> 00:17:46.965 line:95%,end
It's called Me and
You Against the World.

00:17:47.299 --> 00:17:49.902 line:95%,end
And it's all about
a housewife that woke up

00:17:49.968 --> 00:17:51.236 line:95%,end
on the wrong side of the bed.

00:17:51.303 --> 00:17:53.772 line:95%,end
She burnt the bacon
and the pancakes.

00:17:53.839 --> 00:17:55.774 line:95%,end
She spilled coffee
on her husband.

00:17:55.841 --> 00:17:57.109 line:95%,end
I mean, the whole nine yards.

00:17:57.176 --> 00:17:58.343 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:17:58.410 --> 00:17:59.978 line:95%,end
I hope you understand.

00:18:00.412 --> 00:18:03.816 line:95%,end
Call me up after
a bad day of work.

00:18:04.716 --> 00:18:05.784 line:5%,start
MADDIE: I love tapping.

00:18:05.851 --> 00:18:08.554 line:5%,start
I've always been tapping
ever since I was four.

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:10.122 line:95%,end
It's one of my best strengths.

00:18:12.157 --> 00:18:13.459 line:95%,end
That's a good song.

00:18:13.525 --> 00:18:14.960 line:95%,end
Yeah, it's a great solo.
HOLLY: Yeah, it really is.

00:18:15.027 --> 00:18:16.428 line:95%,end
I like the music.

00:18:17.196 --> 00:18:19.765 line:95%,end
I thought Abby said she
wasn't running Maddie's solo.

00:18:19.832 --> 00:18:21.633 line:95%,end
She did.
She told me that today when I
walked in.

00:18:23.068 --> 00:18:24.269 line:95%,end
That's what she told me.

00:18:24.336 --> 00:18:26.405 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I'm thinking she's
going to keep her promise

00:18:26.472 --> 00:18:27.806 line:95%,end
about not running Chloe's.

00:18:27.873 --> 00:18:29.508 line:95%,end
- KELLY: [laughs]
- Something just tells me maybe.

00:18:29.575 --> 00:18:30.676 line:95%,end
That promise she
might keep, but I'm--

00:18:30.742 --> 00:18:32.511 line:95%,end
Melissa's not
Chloe's mother so--

00:18:32.744 --> 00:18:34.613 line:95%,end
Of course, Chloe's not
working on her solo.

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.081 line:95%,end
This is the way it goes here.

00:18:36.148 --> 00:18:38.150 line:95%,end

00:18:43.322 --> 00:18:44.990 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:18:45.057 --> 00:18:47.359 line:95%,end
Abby, she make sure
that nobody wins.

00:18:47.426 --> 00:18:48.760 line:95%,end
And when Chloe did
win, she made sure

00:18:48.827 --> 00:18:51.196 line:95%,end
that she went to the judges
and fixed their mistake.

00:18:51.263 --> 00:18:56.268 line:95%,end
This score ended up
being 97.5, 97 and 1/2.

00:18:56.668 --> 00:19:02.441 line:95%,end
This should be 96.6.

00:19:03.041 --> 00:19:04.042 line:5%,start
This is your winner.

00:19:05.244 --> 00:19:06.645 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: Maddie won everything.

00:19:07.779 --> 00:19:09.348 line:95%,end
Melissa, Christi said,
when she came in,

00:19:09.414 --> 00:19:10.749 line:95%,end
you were having a
meeting with Abby.

00:19:10.816 --> 00:19:11.950 line:95%,end
What were you
talking to her about?

00:19:12.017 --> 00:19:13.018 line:95%,end
I wasn't having a meeting.

00:19:13.085 --> 00:19:14.253 line:95%,end
I was talking to her.

00:19:14.319 --> 00:19:15.487 line:95%,end
What about?

00:19:15.554 --> 00:19:16.622 line:95%,end
None of your concern.

00:19:22.628 --> 00:19:24.062 line:95%,end
Not that you care,
because you hate my kids.

00:19:24.129 --> 00:19:26.064 line:95%,end
- So don't worry about it.
- Who said I hate your kids?

00:19:26.131 --> 00:19:27.332 line:95%,end
MELISSA: It's none
of your concern.

00:19:27.399 --> 00:19:29.568 line:95%,end
My kids are not your concern,
so don't worry about them.

00:19:30.869 --> 00:19:32.504 line:95%,end
KELLY: We all told
you though, Melissa--

00:19:32.571 --> 00:19:33.572 line:95%,end
I don't-- I don't--

00:19:33.639 --> 00:19:34.640 line:95%,end

about your husband?

Nothing. I don't want
to talk about it.

Whatever.

live up to what you do.

--you went against
us and hurt them.

What does that make you think?

00:21:16.675 --> 00:21:18.076 line:95%,end
Because that makes me think
that she doesn't really

00:21:18.143 --> 00:21:19.144 line:95%,end
value our friendship.

00:21:19.211 --> 00:21:20.912 line:95%,end
She's definitely made
it out that dance

important to you in life

Foot underneath you.

JILL: What's going on in there?

00:25:42.974 --> 00:25:44.509 line:95%,end
- What is going on in there?
- I don't know.

00:25:44.576 --> 00:25:47.879 line:95%,end
I thought we were having a
lesson, not a private
conversation.

00:25:48.547 --> 00:25:49.814 line:95%,end
Okay.

00:25:49.881 --> 00:25:52.183 line:95%,end
Dr. Holly might have
a PhD in education,

00:25:52.284 --> 00:25:54.753 line:95%,end
but Melissa has a PhD
in kissing Abby's ass.

ABBY LEE: Thank you for coming.

00:26:14.172 --> 00:26:15.607 line:95%,end
We're in Syracuse, New York.

00:26:15.674 --> 00:26:17.876 line:5%,start
This is our first week
back, so it's very

00:26:17.976 --> 00:26:19.411 line:5%,start
important for the girls to win.

00:26:19.477 --> 00:26:21.046 line:5%,start
If they want to
prove themselves,

00:26:21.112 --> 00:26:22.981 line:95%,end
and prove that they were
working, and they were training,

00:26:23.048 --> 00:26:25.684 line:95%,end
and they were in class,
then they're going to win again.

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:27.018 line:95%,end
All right.

00:26:27.085 --> 00:26:29.721 line:95%,end
Remember, this is the
first competition back.

00:26:29.788 --> 00:26:31.022 line:95%,end
This is it.

00:26:31.089 --> 00:26:33.458 line:95%,end
Don't make me
regret coming home.

00:26:33.525 --> 00:26:37.696 line:95%,end
So ladies, we have three solos.

00:26:37.762 --> 00:26:40.332 line:95%,end
Mackenzie, you're
the first solo up.

00:26:40.398 --> 00:26:41.766 line:95%,end
Then Chloe, your second.

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.768 line:95%,end
Then Maddie, your third.

00:26:43.835 --> 00:26:46.204 line:95%,end
- Maddie, are you ready?
- I had a different shirt,
though.

00:26:47.105 --> 00:26:48.440 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Maddie, come out.

00:26:49.708 --> 00:26:52.110 line:95%,end
Yeah, okay. That's cute.
I don't like the shirt.

00:26:52.177 --> 00:26:54.579 line:95%,end
- MELISSA: You don't?
- No, because this is competing.

00:26:54.646 --> 00:26:56.748 line:5%,start
At this point, Abby
and Team Melissa

00:26:56.815 --> 00:26:58.550 line:5%,start
should just travel to
competitions on their own.

00:26:58.617 --> 00:27:00.719 line:95%,end
Because as it stands right now,

00:27:00.785 --> 00:27:03.288 line:95%,end
we're just kind of the filler
in between the Maddie dances.

00:27:04.656 --> 00:27:06.825 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: Let me see.
Do some steps.

00:27:07.392 --> 00:27:08.893 line:95%,end
I like the back of the shirt.

00:27:10.595 --> 00:27:11.896 line:95%,end
I like the sleeves bouncing.

00:27:12.364 --> 00:27:15.433 line:5%,start
I don't know what it is,
but as soon as Abby comes back
in town,

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:19.237 line:5%,start
I seem to get all sorts of flack
for any attention that Maddie
gets.

00:27:22.907 --> 00:27:26.544 line:95%,end
Mackenzie, Asia's
not here this week.

00:27:27.078 --> 00:27:29.781 line:95%,end
I gave you the solo.

00:27:29.848 --> 00:27:33.251 line:95%,end
If you bomb, she comes back next
week, she gets the solo.

00:27:33.652 --> 00:27:35.120 line:95%,end
I can count on her.

00:27:35.553 --> 00:27:40.925 line:95%,end
She wins because of
this, because of this.

00:27:41.426 --> 00:27:43.495 line:95%,end
Mackenzie needs to
nail her routine.

00:27:44.396 --> 00:27:48.299 line:95%,end
With Asia gone, this is going
to be her opportunity to win.

00:27:48.366 --> 00:27:49.668 line:95%,end
Now, listen, you two.

00:27:49.734 --> 00:27:53.304 line:95%,end
This is the first time
that you're going up against
each other

00:27:53.872 --> 00:27:56.241 line:95%,end
since you did the
same exact routine.

00:27:56.307 --> 00:27:57.308 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:27:57.375 --> 00:28:01.780 line:95%,end
It takes a moment to
break a butterfly.

00:28:01.846 --> 00:28:05.884 line:95%,end
Unaware that's when
you hear an angel cry.

00:28:06.818 --> 00:28:09.688 line:95%,end
Now, you are doing
polar opposites.

00:28:09.754 --> 00:28:12.891 line:95%,end
So if you want to do
a hip-hop dance next time

00:28:12.957 --> 00:28:15.493 line:95%,end
and you want to go to tap dance
in an hour and a half,

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:17.395 line:95%,end
we can do that too.

00:28:18.129 --> 00:28:20.365 line:95%,end
Why shouldn't Chloe
be able to do hip-hop?

00:28:20.432 --> 00:28:22.400 line:95%,end
If she's going to
work in this business

00:28:22.467 --> 00:28:23.668 line:95%,end
as a professional dancer,

00:28:23.735 --> 00:28:28.740 line:95%,end
she better make sure that her
hip-hop is equal with everything
else.

00:28:28.807 --> 00:28:30.308 line:95%,end
All right, let's go.

00:28:30.375 --> 00:28:32.711 line:95%,end
[music, cheers and applause]

00:28:37.115 --> 00:28:39.084 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I'm happy Mackenzie
has a solo this week.

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:41.920 line:95%,end
But Abby told Mackenzie,
you have a solo this week

00:28:41.986 --> 00:28:43.121 line:95%,end
because Asia is not here.

00:28:43.488 --> 00:28:46.825 line:95%,end
Is it just her way of making
Mackenzie work harder?

00:28:47.258 --> 00:28:50.495 line:5%,start
EMCEE: All right, and to the
In10sity stage is act number 11.

00:28:50.562 --> 00:28:52.297 line:5%,start
It's a mini acro solo.

00:28:52.363 --> 00:28:55.834 line:95%,end
Please welcome Mackenzie
performing California Adventure.

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:57.936 line:95%,end

Sunshine, I feel the energy.

00:29:06.578 --> 00:29:09.581 line:95%,end
I need sunshine
falling down on me.

00:29:09.647 --> 00:29:11.983 line:95%,end
Now, sunshine,
don't you hide away.

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:16.988 line:95%,end
I want sunshine each
and every day, hey.

00:29:19.557 --> 00:29:21.459 line:95%,end

00:29:26.831 --> 00:29:29.067 line:95%,end
Sunshine, I feel the energy.

00:29:29.134 --> 00:29:32.904 line:95%,end
I need sunshine
falling down on me now.

00:29:35.206 --> 00:29:36.441 line:95%,end
Sunshine.

ABBY LEE: Mackenzie looks great.

00:29:45.016 --> 00:29:46.151 line:95%,end
Costume's adorable.

00:29:46.251 --> 00:29:49.654 line:95%,end
I think her shot at winning
this is really strong.

00:29:49.721 --> 00:29:52.457 line:95%,end
CHLOE: This is my first
hip-hop solo ever,

00:29:52.524 --> 00:29:56.294 line:95%,end
and we've only ever done
two hip-hop group dances.

00:29:56.361 --> 00:30:01.166 line:5%,start
So it's very weird to be doing
hip-hop, especially as a solo.

00:30:01.232 --> 00:30:05.436 line:5%,start
EMCEE: And next to the stage
is act number 15 is a junior hip
-hop solo.

00:30:05.503 --> 00:30:08.406 line:5%,start
Let's please welcome Chloe
performing Keep it Pumping.

Pumping, yeah.

Keep it pumping, keep
it pumping in here.

00:30:25.056 --> 00:30:31.896 line:95%,end
Put your hands up,
put your hands in the air.

00:30:31.963 --> 00:30:38.503 line:95%,end
Keep it pumping, keep
it pumping in here.

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:44.342 line:95%,end

beautiful, act number 15.

ABBY LEE: Chloe just performed,
and she was good.

00:30:58.590 --> 00:30:59.924 line:95%,end
Good enough for first place?

00:30:59.991 --> 00:31:01.659 line:95%,end
Mm, I don't think so.

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:06.164 line:5%,start
But I know that my best shot
for first place is coming up
next.

00:31:06.231 --> 00:31:08.967 line:5%,start
EMCEE: This is act number 13,
junior tap solo.

00:31:22.247 --> 00:31:26.150 line:95%,end
I woke up on the
wrong side of the bed.

00:31:26.217 --> 00:31:30.488 line:95%,end
And I spilled coffee
on your white T.

00:31:30.555 --> 00:31:34.692 line:95%,end
I burnt your bacon,
burnt your pancakes, and my
hand.

00:31:34.759 --> 00:31:38.696 line:95%,end
It's not my day, I
hope you understand.

00:31:39.597 --> 00:31:42.967 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: The apron starts to
come down in the middle of the
number.

00:31:43.034 --> 00:31:47.805 line:95%,end
You know I'll put you first,

00:31:47.872 --> 00:31:50.441 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: And that kid
doesn't miss a beat.

00:31:50.708 --> 00:31:53.745 line:95%,end
She is right on the money
the entire routine.

00:31:53.811 --> 00:31:56.514 line:95%,end
Me and you against the world.

00:31:56.581 --> 00:32:00.818 line:95%,end

EMCEE: That was You and Me
Against the World.

00:32:05.757 --> 00:32:08.426 line:95%,end
That kid was like a pro.

00:32:09.127 --> 00:32:10.662 line:95%,end
JILL: I thought all
of them look great.

00:32:10.728 --> 00:32:13.031 line:95%,end
Mackenzie is looking so strong.

00:32:13.097 --> 00:32:14.666 line:95%,end
And Maddie looked great.

00:32:15.166 --> 00:32:17.702 line:95%,end
Maddie's apron came down,
and I looked over at Abby--

00:32:17.769 --> 00:32:19.437 line:95%,end
- JILL: Abby was laughing.
- --and Abby laughed.

00:32:19.537 --> 00:32:20.605 line:95%,end
I know.

00:32:20.705 --> 00:32:23.374 line:95%,end
When Chloe lost her headband,
Christi was like--

00:32:23.441 --> 00:32:24.876 line:95%,end
- Dead
- --murdered.

00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:26.811 line:95%,end
Oh, my god.

00:32:26.878 --> 00:32:28.146 line:95%,end
It came forward.

00:32:28.246 --> 00:32:29.280 line:95%,end
What did you want me to do?

00:32:29.347 --> 00:32:30.381 line:95%,end
You were in the
bar having a drink,

00:32:30.448 --> 00:32:31.749 line:95%,end
and her head piece
is falling off!

00:32:31.816 --> 00:32:33.685 line:95%,end
Like she's not going to come
in here and yell at Melissa.

00:32:33.751 --> 00:32:36.688 line:95%,end
She's not going to be upset with
Maddie like she screamed at me,

00:32:36.754 --> 00:32:37.889 line:95%,end
she was angry with Chloe.

00:32:37.989 --> 00:32:39.557 line:95%,end
Like, that's not going
to happen with them.

00:32:40.692 --> 00:32:41.893 line:95%,end
It is what it is.


00:32:45.463 --> 00:32:46.698 line:5%,start
I guess I should have pinned it.

00:32:46.764 --> 00:32:48.333 line:5%,start
But I had it
Velcroed really good.

00:32:48.399 --> 00:32:50.568 line:95%,end
- But you must have gotten it
like-- - Just--

00:32:50.635 --> 00:32:51.669 line:95%,end
MELISSA: You must have just
gotten it in your hair.

00:32:52.737 --> 00:32:55.106 line:95%,end
Melissa, you are
on my last nerve.

00:32:57.208 --> 00:32:58.476 line:95%,end
Amazing job.

00:33:00.511 --> 00:33:01.579 line:95%,end
I was nervous. Seen

00:33:01.646 --> 00:33:02.880 line:95%,end
Chloe, you did a great job too,

00:33:02.947 --> 00:33:05.650 line:95%,end
but we're back to right where
we started, forgetting the
dance.

00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:07.251 line:95%,end
Did you forgot the dance?

00:33:08.219 --> 00:33:09.287 line:5%,start
You forgot this whole thing.

00:33:11.322 --> 00:33:13.257 line:95%,end
- That's eight counts.
- I did--

00:33:13.324 --> 00:33:15.193 line:95%,end
You did not do this.

00:33:15.259 --> 00:33:17.362 line:95%,end
This, swish, swish.

00:33:17.428 --> 00:33:19.097 line:95%,end
You're really going
to argue with me?

00:33:19.163 --> 00:33:20.565 line:95%,end
- [sighs]
- ABBY LEE: Really?

00:33:21.132 --> 00:33:23.501 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: As far as I can see,
Chloe didn't forget any piece

00:33:23.601 --> 00:33:24.769 line:95%,end
of her choreography.

00:33:24.836 --> 00:33:27.271 line:5%,start
And if she did, I put
that back on Abby,

00:33:27.338 --> 00:33:29.474 line:5%,start
because she gave her
two times to run the dance.

00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:31.809 line:5%,start
Who remembers that entire
dance with two rehearsals?

00:33:31.876 --> 00:33:33.044 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:33:33.611 --> 00:33:34.846 line:95%,end
Okay.

00:33:36.948 --> 00:33:38.916 line:95%,end
Look, it keeps
getting curly again.

00:33:38.983 --> 00:33:40.718 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: [gasps] Don't touch it!

00:33:40.785 --> 00:33:42.587 line:95%,end
I'm sorry, Maddie.
Oh, Maddie, I'm sorry.

00:33:42.653 --> 00:33:44.389 line:95%,end
I'm a wicked brusher.
I forgot to tell you.

00:33:44.455 --> 00:33:45.590 line:95%,end
I'm sorry.

00:33:45.656 --> 00:33:47.859 line:95%,end
Woo, baby!

00:33:47.925 --> 00:33:49.293 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: All right, come on.
Let me see this looks.

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:50.795 line:95%,end
Let's go. Good.

00:33:50.862 --> 00:33:52.263 line:95%,end
This is it, ladies.

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:57.402 line:95%,end
Chloe, Maddie, now is
the time to go out and prove

00:33:57.502 --> 00:33:58.503 line:95%,end
how wonderful you are.

00:33:58.569 --> 00:34:01.039 line:95%,end
Go out and do what
you were taught.

00:34:01.672 --> 00:34:03.975 line:5%,start
Now, this group,
I'm a little worried about.

00:34:04.042 --> 00:34:05.810 line:5%,start
I don't understand
why the kids

00:34:05.877 --> 00:34:07.945 line:5%,start
aren't more familiar
with these characters.

00:34:08.012 --> 00:34:09.747 line:95%,end
Let's go. Come on.

[music playing]

00:34:29.333 --> 00:34:36.340 line:5%,start
I hear echoes inside myself,
banging the walls for help.

00:34:37.008 --> 00:34:43.848 line:95%,end
Eating at my heart,
choking on the darkness outside
myself.

00:34:44.282 --> 00:34:48.886 line:95%,end
Some kind of malady
I can't spell.

00:34:48.953 --> 00:34:55.960 line:95%,end
Eating at my heart, choking on
the darkness outside myself.

00:34:56.928 --> 00:35:03.835 line:95%,end
Banging the walls to tell me
that I'm not an empty shell.

00:35:03.901 --> 00:35:06.537 line:95%,end
It comes from the inside of me.

00:35:06.604 --> 00:35:11.976 line:95%,end
My reality is
nothing I can't be.

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:18.883 line:95%,end
Oh, I won't wait.

00:35:21.919 --> 00:35:24.856 line:95%,end

Now, can I be honest?

00:35:34.932 --> 00:35:36.701 line:95%,end
The only person I
watch was Maddie.

00:35:37.602 --> 00:35:38.736 line:95%,end
I was watching her face.

00:35:38.803 --> 00:35:40.438 line:95%,end
She was all over the place.

00:35:40.505 --> 00:35:44.909 line:95%,end
She was sad, and she was angry,
and she was haunting

00:35:44.976 --> 00:35:46.444 line:5%,start
all at the same time.

MELISSA: Mackenzie
won first place.

00:36:23.381 --> 00:36:25.183 line:5%,start
Abby really wanted
Mackenzie to prove to her

00:36:25.249 --> 00:36:26.918 line:5%,start
that she could win.

00:36:26.984 --> 00:36:30.054 line:95%,end

Congratulations to all of our
elite junior small groups.

The group just won first place,

00:37:54.672 --> 00:37:56.474 line:95%,end
and Abby can't even bother
to look up from her phone,

00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:59.343 line:95%,end
because she's so upset that
Maddie got second place.

00:38:00.278 --> 00:38:01.545 line:95%,end
Oh, boy.

00:38:01.612 --> 00:38:03.981 line:95%,end
Thank God that we won
in the group dance.

00:38:04.048 --> 00:38:05.116 line:95%,end
- Yeah.
- I know.

00:38:05.182 --> 00:38:07.151 line:95%,end
Oh, I don't think Abby
cares that the girls won.

00:38:07.218 --> 00:38:09.287 line:95%,end
The only thing she cares
about is Maddie's solo.

00:38:10.855 --> 00:38:12.590 line:95%,end
KELLY: I feel kind of bad
that the girls probably

00:38:12.657 --> 00:38:14.759 line:95%,end
won't get to enjoy their win.

00:38:14.825 --> 00:38:18.095 line:95%,end
So all your kissing ass
and doing whatever has paid off.

00:38:18.763 --> 00:38:21.299 line:95%,end
And aren't you glad that
you went to LA to make sure

00:38:21.365 --> 00:38:22.867 line:95%,end
that she will protect you?

00:38:23.868 --> 00:38:27.138 line:95%,end
But you don't see when you
do things against the group

00:38:27.204 --> 00:38:28.439 line:95%,end
that it hurts our kids.

00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:35.112 line:95%,end
My kids come first to me,
and they always will come first
to me.

00:38:36.414 --> 00:38:38.316 line:95%,end
I can't say that I'm fed up
with Melissa's lying

00:38:38.382 --> 00:38:40.117 line:95%,end
and fakeness,
because I've always been fed up

00:38:40.217 --> 00:38:41.686 line:95%,end
with Melissa's
lying and fakeness.

00:38:41.752 --> 00:38:43.954 line:95%,end
But I think all of the other
moms in the room

00:38:44.021 --> 00:38:46.123 line:95%,end
are finally fed up with it too.

00:38:46.724 --> 00:38:48.092 line:95%,end

00:38:48.392 --> 00:38:49.593 line:95%,end
Good job!

I got fourth with hip-hop!

CHRISTI: I know. High five!

00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:53.798 line:95%,end
KELLY: You did good.
- High five.

00:38:53.864 --> 00:38:55.866 line:95%,end
See?
And Melissa thought you were
upset.

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:58.636 line:95%,end
Uh, you said that Maddie was so
upset, okay?

00:38:58.736 --> 00:39:00.805 line:95%,end
- So kiss my ass!
- CHRISTI: She looked upset.

00:39:00.871 --> 00:39:02.273 line:95%,end
Why are you saying this
in front of your kids?

00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:04.308 line:95%,end
Because guess what?
You do it all the time.

00:39:04.375 --> 00:39:06.377 line:95%,end
You talk about my
kid all the time.

00:39:06.444 --> 00:39:08.346 line:95%,end
You said, oh, Maddie is upset.

00:39:08.412 --> 00:39:11.148 line:95%,end
Every time Maddie doesn't win,
oh, my god, Maddie's upset.

00:39:11.215 --> 00:39:13.017 line:95%,end
Maddie's upset.
So don't play the the game.

00:39:13.918 --> 00:39:15.786 line:95%,end
She was crying. Thank you.

00:39:15.853 --> 00:39:17.755 line:95%,end
Oh, whatever.

00:39:17.822 --> 00:39:19.590 line:95%,end
Screw you! I'm done.

00:39:19.657 --> 00:39:21.559 line:95%,end
I'm so over it. You know what?

00:39:21.625 --> 00:39:23.327 line:95%,end
You're always against me.

00:39:24.695 --> 00:39:27.898 line:95%,end
Come on. Why don't you tell that
that trashy girl to stop?

00:39:27.965 --> 00:39:29.367 line:95%,end
- Let's go.
- We're leaving.

00:39:30.801 --> 00:39:32.770 line:95%,end
When I walk into the dressing
room. And Melissa's mad.

00:39:32.837 --> 00:39:35.005 line:95%,end
She's leaving.
The other kids aren't even in
there.

00:39:35.072 --> 00:39:36.140 line:95%,end
They're all milling around.

00:39:36.207 --> 00:39:38.709 line:95%,end
What is going on
with the Abby Lee Dance Company?

00:39:38.776 --> 00:39:39.877 line:95%,end
Come on, girls.

00:39:43.681 --> 00:39:45.216 line:95%,end
You are all sitting here
like we have another number.

00:39:45.316 --> 00:39:47.418 line:95%,end
It's over. Get your
stuff together.

00:39:48.152 --> 00:39:49.887 line:95%,end
Okay, let's go.
We don't have yet our children.

00:39:52.723 --> 00:39:54.725 line:95%,end

Melissa, what's going on with
you?

00:40:03.667 --> 00:40:04.769 line:95%,end
Tell me what happened.

00:40:04.835 --> 00:40:06.203 line:95%,end
Maddie is fine.

00:40:09.106 --> 00:40:15.646 line:95%,end
Maddie, learn from Chloe or
learn from Christi being evil,
not to cry.

00:40:18.682 --> 00:40:20.217 line:95%,end
You've got to save
it for the pillow,

00:40:20.284 --> 00:40:24.455 line:95%,end
because people like
that make it worse.

00:40:24.889 --> 00:40:28.559 line:95%,end
Every time you get knocked down,
you fight that much more.

00:40:28.626 --> 00:40:30.327 line:95%,end
And that's what
makes you Maddie.

00:40:30.995 --> 00:40:32.229 line:95%,end
You're a survivor.

00:40:32.296 --> 00:40:33.464 line:95%,end
Got it?

00:40:33.898 --> 00:40:36.100 line:95%,end
The moms? They're
jealous of Maddie.

00:40:36.167 --> 00:40:39.270 line:95%,end
This is Maddie's time to shine,
and they don't understand that.

00:40:39.336 --> 00:40:40.771 line:95%,end
Come over here
and give me a hug.

00:40:45.443 --> 00:40:46.777 line:95%,end
Oh.

00:40:46.844 --> 00:40:48.345 line:95%,end
Next on "Dance Moms."

00:40:48.412 --> 00:40:52.349 line:5%,start
This week, you will be
performing in the annual dance
concert.

Now, something else is going on.

00:40:54.618 --> 00:40:56.487 line:5%,start
We're going to throw
in a photo shoot.

Shush the beak!

00:40:57.721 --> 00:40:58.889 line:5%,start
Stop it.

00:40:58.956 --> 00:41:00.491 line:5%,start
Since when does your
ass go on my stage?

00:41:01.091 --> 00:41:03.194 line:5%,start
If you think Christi and Kelly
are going to make your kid

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:05.996 line:5%,start
a star, by all means, go.

00:41:06.063 --> 00:41:07.298 line:5%,start
Pick which side you're on.

00:41:07.364 --> 00:41:10.501 line:5%,start
Never in 40 years of being
in the Abby Lee Dance Company

00:41:10.568 --> 00:41:15.272 line:5%,start
has anyone been giving a solo
the day of the [bleep] recital!

00:41:15.339 --> 00:41:17.074 line:5%,start
She's going to crap all over me
and talk to me that way

00:41:17.141 --> 00:41:18.142 line:5%,start
in front of my customers?

00:41:18.209 --> 00:41:19.210 line:5%,start
No way.
