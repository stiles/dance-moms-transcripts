ABBY LEE MILLER: Previously on
"Dance Moms" Tell All Reunion.

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:04.571 line:5%,start
You can go ahead and lie about that,

00:00:04.637 --> 00:00:05.739 line:5%,start
but you know that wasn't the problem.

00:00:05.805 --> 00:00:07.173 line:5%,start
You know what? You don't want to go there.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.975 line:5%,start
It was disrespectful and rude saying

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:11.444 line:5%,start
she has to hide behind a mask.

00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:12.912 line:5%,start
I did not want to see my daughter

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:14.080 line:5%,start
being totally humiliated.

00:00:14.247 --> 00:00:15.348 line:5%,start
Chloe gets beat all the time.

00:00:15.415 --> 00:00:16.416 line:5%,start
You make sure of that.

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:18.651 line:5%,start
I pay Abby to critique my child.

00:00:18.952 --> 00:00:22.288 line:5%,start
You act as though this
90-pound weakling beat you up.

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:23.656 line:5%,start
When you strike another person,

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:24.958 line:5%,start
you have crossed the line.

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:26.026 line:5%,start
Swat.

00:00:26.092 --> 00:00:27.861 line:5%,start
I swatted you, and it
probably didn't even hurt.

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:29.129 line:5%,start
OK, I'm finished.

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:30.397 line:5%,start
- No, no, no. She's not--
- Yes, I am.

00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:31.698 line:5%,start
No, no, no. No, no, no.

00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:32.999 line:5%,start
She's threatened by me.

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:35.802 line:5%,start
NARRATOR: Coming up on
"Dance Moms" Tell All.

00:00:36.169 --> 00:00:37.404 line:5%,start
There was a lot of jealousy.

00:00:37.504 --> 00:00:39.272 line:5%,start
They've been running
off customers for years.

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:40.373 line:5%,start
I'm not here to make friends.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.108 line:5%,start
It's my kid you're talking about.

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:44.944 line:5%,start
Honey, I didn't take my hand
up his [bleep] and make him

00:00:45.011 --> 00:00:46.212 line:5%,start
a ventriloquist.

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:47.414 line:5%,start
Why are they crying?

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.782 line:5%,start
If they're going to cry, they're

00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:50.550 line:5%,start
not going to make it
in the world of dance.

00:00:50.617 --> 00:00:52.786 line:5%,start
I don't want her to
have these experiences.

00:00:52.852 --> 00:00:55.288 line:5%,start
I don't want people to think
it's all about the screaming.

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:56.923 line:5%,start
Where were you guys three years ago?

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.892 line:5%,start
Crap like you should
be shoved down a toilet.

00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.894 line:5%,start
We beat you, so that's how crappy I am.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.862 line:5%,start
Look at your poor
pathetic mother over there.

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:04.564 line:5%,start
Did you just call my mother pathetic?

00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:05.799 line:5%,start
I don't care.

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:07.400 line:5%,start
She's nothing to me, and neither are you.

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:10.637 line:5%,start
[MUSIC - NIKKO LOWE, "LIVING ON
THE DANCE FLOOR"]

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:12.806 line:95%,end
(SINGING) Get up.

00:01:12.972 --> 00:01:14.841 line:95%,end
Get on the floor.

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:20.213 line:95%,end
My world is with my girls
living on the dance floor.

00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:22.782 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:01:23.817 --> 00:01:25.251 line:5%,start
Hi, everybody, I'm Jeff Collins,

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:28.321 line:5%,start
and welcome back to Part 2 of
our "Dance Moms" Tell All.

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:31.357 line:95%,end
The whole gang's back,
plus we have a couple

00:01:31.424 --> 00:01:32.992 line:95%,end
of new moms joining us.

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:34.694 line:95%,end
Our audience has even more questions,

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:36.696 line:95%,end
and the girls are back to perform again.

00:01:36.796 --> 00:01:39.299 line:95%,end
The Abby Lee Dance Company
has seen a lot of drama,

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:41.668 line:95%,end
and things got really heated this season.

00:01:41.835 --> 00:01:42.936 line:95%,end
Take a look.

00:01:43.136 --> 00:01:45.738 line:95%,end
Be grateful that Sophia
has come to Pittsburgh

00:01:45.805 --> 00:01:47.073 line:95%,end
and join that group.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.511 line:95%,end
It's like going from mediocre
to flying first class.

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:54.013 line:95%,end
You are committed, and if you leave,

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:55.815 line:95%,end
you owe her $100,000 cash.

00:01:55.882 --> 00:01:57.584 line:95%,end
Well, thank God I have $100,000.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.419 line:95%,end
Sometimes if you have nothing
interesting

00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:01.488 line:95%,end
or intelligent to say,
you should just be quiet.

00:02:01.855 --> 00:02:03.890 line:95%,end
And I won't be quiet because
I always do have something

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:04.991 line:95%,end
interesting or intelligent.

00:02:05.158 --> 00:02:06.392 line:95%,end
I disagree on that one.

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:07.527 line:95%,end
- Kristie.
- Yes?

00:02:07.594 --> 00:02:09.395 line:95%,end
Look at me when you're speaking.
Look at me when you talk.

00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:11.030 line:95%,end
- Excuse me?
- Excuse me.

00:02:11.097 --> 00:02:13.233 line:95%,end
- I'm looking you in the eye, bitch.
- Let's go.

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:14.467 line:95%,end
I'm not that way.

00:02:14.534 --> 00:02:15.969 line:95%,end
You need to settle yourself down.

00:02:16.035 --> 00:02:18.872 line:95%,end
No, I don't. Do not call me a bitch
if you can't back it up.

00:02:20.073 --> 00:02:22.275 line:95%,end
After a wild and explosive season,

00:02:22.542 --> 00:02:25.078 line:95%,end
"Dance Moms" Tell All
Reunion starts right now.

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:27.881 line:95%,end
So let's bring out the star of our show.

00:02:27.947 --> 00:02:29.883 line:95%,end
Please welcome Abby Lee Miller.

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:31.584 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:02:34.654 --> 00:02:36.689 line:95%,end
- How are you?
- I'm good.

00:02:36.756 --> 00:02:38.691 line:95%,end
- It's great to see you.
- Thank you.

00:02:38.758 --> 00:02:40.760 line:95%,end
Have a seat.
You're looking fabulous.

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:42.729 line:95%,end
Ready to do this again?
- Thank you. Thank you.

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.430 line:95%,end
Well, I guess.
- All right, let's do it.

00:02:44.497 --> 00:02:46.833 line:95%,end
With the moms walking out at
the beginning of the season,

00:02:46.933 --> 00:02:50.170 line:95%,end
it meant that there were new
moms that came into the mix.

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:53.740 line:95%,end
How did Kristie Ray and
Jackie fit in with our group?

00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:56.776 line:95%,end
They were nice.
They were respectful.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.478 line:95%,end
They followed my rules.

00:02:58.578 --> 00:03:02.849 line:95%,end
With the other moms, I think
there was a lot of jealousy.

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:05.351 line:95%,end
So how do you think what
went on up in the observation

00:03:05.418 --> 00:03:07.020 line:95%,end
mezzanine may have played into

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.055 line:95%,end
running off some of your paying customers?

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:12.292 line:95%,end
Oh, they've been running
off customers for years.

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:15.895 line:5%,start
Ridiculous. Critiquing
other people's children, ridiculous.

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:17.764 line:5%,start
So do you think that
started right from the start

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.699 line:5%,start
when these kids came in and
they saw how talented they were?

00:03:19.766 --> 00:03:21.134 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: Yes.

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:22.802 line:95%,end
Well, one of the things that
we saw pop up on the blogs

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:24.270 line:95%,end
and people ask about was they wanted

00:03:24.337 --> 00:03:28.007 line:95%,end
to know why Sophia and Maddie didn't ever

00:03:28.074 --> 00:03:29.309 line:95%,end
compete against each other.

00:03:29.442 --> 00:03:31.711 line:95%,end
What we had planned
was for Sophia and Maddie

00:03:31.778 --> 00:03:36.849 line:95%,end
to do a tap duet, because
Sophia is an amazing tap dancer,

00:03:37.317 --> 00:03:39.552 line:95%,end
and so is Maddie and you never get


00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:41.154 line:95%,end
to see Maddie do that on the show.

00:03:41.287 --> 00:03:45.391 line:95%,end
So who is a better dancer,
Sophia or Maddie?

00:03:49.762 --> 00:03:52.232 line:95%,end
I think they're very different dancers.

00:03:52.298 --> 00:03:53.866 line:95%,end
I'm not going to sit on this stage

00:03:53.933 --> 00:03:56.102 line:95%,end
and tell you that one is
better than the other.

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:59.706 line:95%,end
I think Sophia has had a lot
more opportunities than Maddie.

00:03:59.772 --> 00:04:05.712 line:95%,end
I think Sophia is hit it hard
and dynamic and entertaining

00:04:05.778 --> 00:04:11.217 line:95%,end
and just lights up the
stage and she blows me away.

00:04:11.684 --> 00:04:16.189 line:95%,end
Maddie, I think she hears
the music and it's passionate

00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:18.024 line:95%,end
and it comes from her heart.

00:04:18.358 --> 00:04:20.827 line:95%,end
It's not about the sass
and the hitting it hard.

00:04:20.893 --> 00:04:22.829 line:95%,end
It's about the placement.

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:26.633 line:95%,end
And they're just so, so very different.

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:28.167 line:95%,end
That's why I personally never wanted

00:04:28.234 --> 00:04:30.603 line:95%,end
them to go against each other
because I wanted

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.139 line:95%,end
the two kids to collaborate
and learn from each other.

00:04:33.206 --> 00:04:37.543 line:95%,end
I was trying to get Maddie
to learn from Sophia,

00:04:37.677 --> 00:04:40.246 line:95%,end
and that will never happen.

00:04:40.313 --> 00:04:42.815 line:95%,end
Let's do the same comparison
with Asia and Mackenzie.

00:04:42.882 --> 00:04:44.851 line:95%,end
Who's a better dancer?

00:04:44.917 --> 00:04:46.552 line:95%,end
Asia is a rock star.

00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:48.921 line:95%,end
She's an absolutely better performer.

00:04:48.988 --> 00:04:53.026 line:95%,end
If I was to ask her about
Bob Fosse and Michael Bennett,

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:56.562 line:95%,end
I think Mackenzie is more knowledgeable.

00:04:56.863 --> 00:04:59.532 line:95%,end
You would do something different
if Asia was your student full-time?

00:04:59.732 --> 00:05:01.067 line:95%,end
Well, Asia has learned.

00:05:01.167 --> 00:05:04.437 line:95%,end
She has improved
in the last month at my studio.

00:05:04.537 --> 00:05:07.206 line:95%,end
- Right.
- And she's conscious of her flaws.

00:05:07.273 --> 00:05:10.843 line:95%,end
She correct herself before
I even have to step in,

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.879 line:95%,end
and that is a battle that I've won.

00:05:13.012 --> 00:05:14.280 line:95%,end
That's amazing. That's amazing.

00:05:14.347 --> 00:05:15.915 line:95%,end
Abby isn't that great of a teacher.

00:05:16.015 --> 00:05:19.052 line:5%,start
What did Abby really teach you?

00:05:19.118 --> 00:05:20.853 line:5%,start
Not really anything.

00:05:20.953 --> 00:05:24.824 line:95%,end
I don't think we brought
one thing home from our time

00:05:24.924 --> 00:05:27.660 line:95%,end
that we spent at ALDC that we could use.

00:05:27.727 --> 00:05:30.496 line:95%,end
And Mackenzie has realized
very quickly

00:05:30.763 --> 00:05:32.265 line:95%,end
that you have to step up to the plate.

00:05:32.432 --> 00:05:34.233 line:95%,end
- So Asia really made her step it up.
- Yes.

00:05:34.467 --> 00:05:37.904 line:95%,end
I think that Sophia rocked Maddie's world,

00:05:38.671 --> 00:05:41.240 line:95%,end
but Maddie is smart enough to figure out--

00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:44.577 line:95%,end
she used it in a positive way.

00:05:44.644 --> 00:05:46.245 line:95%,end
She was enlightened.

00:05:46.312 --> 00:05:48.548 line:95%,end
- I think Mackenzie did the same thing.
- Well, that's amazing.

00:05:48.781 --> 00:05:50.850 line:95%,end
Let's take some questions
from the audience for Abby.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:52.819 line:95%,end
Do you think the other
dance moms are jealous

00:05:52.885 --> 00:05:55.388 line:95%,end
of Kristie Ray because of
her physical attributes?

00:05:55.988 --> 00:05:58.758 line:95%,end
Oh! Yes.
So am I. [laughter]

00:05:59.058 --> 00:06:01.361 line:95%,end
My goodness.
Her waist is this big.

00:06:02.295 --> 00:06:03.563 line:95%,end
Way up here.

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:06.366 line:95%,end
She's exquisite
and she's exotic and she's fun.

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:07.700 line:95%,end
Pretty, pretty, girl.

00:06:07.834 --> 00:06:10.570 line:95%,end
- That was nice.
- Thank you, Abby.

00:06:10.636 --> 00:06:12.138 line:95%,end
Asia Ray's mom is here.

00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:14.240 line:95%,end
Please welcome Kristie Ray.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.275 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:06:17.243 --> 00:06:19.011 line:95%,end
- Look at that dress.
ABBY LEE MILLER: Whoa.

00:06:19.145 --> 00:06:21.848 line:95%,end
- How are you? Come sit.
- How are you? Look, I get the hug.

00:06:22.014 --> 00:06:23.282 line:95%,end
Yeah.

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:25.184 line:95%,end
- I don't want to mess up her makeup.
- How are you?

00:06:25.318 --> 00:06:26.786 line:95%,end
- Wonderful.
- Wow.

00:06:26.853 --> 00:06:28.354 line:95%,end
It's been a long time
since we've seen you.

00:06:28.421 --> 00:06:29.422 line:95%,end
Yes.

00:06:29.522 --> 00:06:31.891 line:95%,end
We first met you at Abby's
Ultimate Dance Competition

00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.226 line:95%,end
back in the summer.
- Mm-hmm.

00:06:33.292 --> 00:06:35.294 line:95%,end
So when you went to
Abby's studio in Pittsburgh,

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:38.664 line:95%,end
how was it fitting in with the moms?

00:06:38.731 --> 00:06:43.169 line:95%,end
Well, first I want to

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:47.740 line:95%,end
and I'm here because I appreciate Abby.

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:50.843 line:95%,end
And being an outsider coming in here,

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.146 line:95%,end
I knew an outsider was never going to fit

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:56.916 line:95%,end
in the world of these moms
that have been a group for so long.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.019 line:95%,end
But I'm not here to actually make friends.

00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:03.222 line:95%,end
I'm here to move my daughter
forward, get the training

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:04.524 line:95%,end
that she needs.

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:07.827 line:95%,end
And Asia gravitates
towards strong, tough love

00:07:07.894 --> 00:07:12.465 line:95%,end
that some may disagree with,
and since she's been with Abby,

00:07:12.565 --> 00:07:14.434 line:95%,end
I've seen a tremendous difference.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.437 line:95%,end
So right now, fitting in
is not an issue with me


00:07:17.503 --> 00:07:18.838 line:95%,end
because I'm doing it for Asia.

00:07:18.905 --> 00:07:20.072 line:95%,end
So tell me this.

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:21.741 line:95%,end
Which one of the moms at
the Abby Lee Dance Company

00:07:21.808 --> 00:07:23.176 line:95%,end
did you have the most trouble with?

00:07:23.242 --> 00:07:25.745 line:95%,end
I think they all have issues with me

00:07:26.112 --> 00:07:28.748 line:95%,end
that maybe they just don't understand
why I'm here.

00:07:28.815 --> 00:07:32.919 line:95%,end
I think they think there's
some ulterior motive,

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:35.087 line:95%,end
something else going on.

00:07:35.154 --> 00:07:38.991 line:95%,end
Well, most people want to
leave Pittsburgh and go to LA

00:07:40.359 --> 00:07:41.894 line:95%,end
for their dance career.

00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:44.497 line:95%,end
Like there's not many
opportunities in Pittsburgh.

00:07:44.564 --> 00:07:46.098 line:95%,end
I mean, let's be real.

00:07:46.165 --> 00:07:48.501 line:95%,end
So it just seems odd.

00:07:48.601 --> 00:07:50.203 line:95%,end
I see what she sees.

00:07:50.269 --> 00:07:56.042 line:95%,end
And there's 181 dance studios
in Orange County, California alone.

00:07:56.108 --> 00:07:59.011 line:95%,end
She can get great training right here.

00:07:59.078 --> 00:08:01.747 line:95%,end
But Asia worked with me in the one on one

00:08:01.848 --> 00:08:03.616 line:95%,end
private tutoring session.

00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:08.154 line:95%,end
And in that 30 minutes, I fix things.

00:08:08.721 --> 00:08:11.357 line:95%,end
And maybe I'm the right teacher for Asia.

00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:12.792 line:95%,end
- Yeah. She soaked it up.
ABBY LEE MILLER: Yes.

00:08:12.859 --> 00:08:14.560 line:95%,end
But it's also Abby teaches hard,

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.262 line:95%,end
so it prepares them for the real world.

00:08:16.362 --> 00:08:18.531 line:95%,end
Let me ask you something.
Do you think these moms are scared of you?

00:08:20.233 --> 00:08:21.667 line:95%,end
No. I don't think
they're scared of me.

00:08:21.834 --> 00:08:24.237 line:95%,end
Like we said something about
how Asia cries

00:08:24.303 --> 00:08:26.506 line:95%,end
and it was like she was going to beat
the [bleep] out of Kristie.

00:08:26.973 --> 00:08:29.242 line:95%,end
And we were like, whoa.
Hold back.

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:33.079 line:95%,end
They know that I'm not a pushover
and they know that I stand my ground.

00:08:33.212 --> 00:08:37.383 line:95%,end
And I do, you know,
have a slight snappiness.

00:08:37.483 --> 00:08:40.553 line:95%,end
I mean-- [laughs] un poquito.
- Un poquito.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:43.523 line:95%,end
But you know what, I don't like something
that I feel passion about

00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:45.691 line:95%,end
and have it like twisted or downplayed.

00:08:45.758 --> 00:08:48.427 line:95%,end
And I think that, in some cases,
they try to do that.

00:08:48.661 --> 00:08:52.365 line:95%,end
I didn't think that she would
rattle anybody's nerves

00:08:52.431 --> 00:08:54.667 line:95%,end
because Asia is seven.

00:08:54.734 --> 00:08:56.435 line:95%,end
What does little Asian matter?

00:08:56.502 --> 00:08:59.472 line:95%,end
And then we went to a
competition not too long ago

00:08:59.939 --> 00:09:02.441 line:95%,end
and Maddie won and Asia was second.

00:09:02.875 --> 00:09:05.411 line:95%,end
- She beat a lot of those older kids.
- Wow, that's amazing.

00:09:05.578 --> 00:09:08.581 line:95%,end
So what does Asia bring to your
studio that no other kid has?

00:09:08.648 --> 00:09:14.987 line:95%,end
[laughs] Energy, excitement,
and a whole lot of sass.

00:09:15.121 --> 00:09:18.157 line:95%,end
She does, I mean, I remember her
from Abby's Ultimate Dance Competition.

00:09:18.257 --> 00:09:19.625 line:95%,end
The kid's bouncing off
the walls like 24/7.

00:09:19.692 --> 00:09:24.797 line:95%,end
She is. She is.
She has a tremendous work ethic.

00:09:24.864 --> 00:09:29.201 line:95%,end
As far as a student goes
and feeding off of her energy, I love it.

00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:33.072 line:95%,end

So Kristie Ray, let's take some
questions from the audience.

00:12:58.043 --> 00:13:00.579 line:95%,end
At the end of the season,
we saw things get really heated

00:13:00.679 --> 00:13:04.049 line:95%,end
between you, Kristie, and Jill.
Can you tell us your side of the story?

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:08.587 line:95%,end
Asia is not typically a
seven-year-old who cries a lot.

00:13:08.788 --> 00:13:11.457 line:95%,end
She's very strong-natured,
and I think that bothers them.

00:13:12.057 --> 00:13:14.026 line:95%,end
I know they probably say it doesn't,
but I think it does

00:13:14.126 --> 00:13:15.961 line:95%,end
because I do see
the children cry a lot.

00:13:16.162 --> 00:13:20.366 line:95%,end
I'm thinking maybe that
they're thinking I don't let Asia cry.

00:13:20.666 --> 00:13:24.103 line:95%,end
And then I have Jill
telling another twisted story that

00:13:24.336 --> 00:13:25.771 line:95%,end
I just didn't agree with.

00:13:26.005 --> 00:13:28.774 line:95%,end
Kristie Ray, let's get Jill
and Kristie's version of this story.

- Does it? OK.

00:13:43.522 --> 00:13:47.092 line:95%,end
So Jill, you obviously have a
problem with Kristie, right?

00:13:47.359 --> 00:13:50.796 line:95%,end
I really don't have
a problem with Kristie or Asia.

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:53.833 line:95%,end
Where the problem started was
Kristie came in

00:13:53.933 --> 00:13:56.802 line:95%,end
and said we love tough love
and Asia is such a tough kid.

00:13:56.902 --> 00:13:58.370 line:95%,end
And good for her.

00:13:58.737 --> 00:14:00.639 line:95%,end
Some of our kids aren't as tough,

00:14:00.806 --> 00:14:06.445 line:95%,end
but don't say your child can
take all this when she can't.

00:14:06.512 --> 00:14:08.480 line:95%,end
And we saw, and she's seven.

00:14:08.581 --> 00:14:11.517 line:95%,end
It was late one night.
She had just gotten screamed at.

00:14:11.584 --> 00:14:13.552 line:95%,end
We're all new people.
She doesn't know us.

00:14:13.652 --> 00:14:15.588 line:95%,end
She ran into the bathroom
and she broke down.

00:14:15.654 --> 00:14:18.224 line:95%,end
She went to the bathroom.
She shut the door in private.

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:22.061 line:95%,end
Well, she was directed to go
into the bathroom so no one saw her cry.

00:14:22.127 --> 00:14:25.030 line:95%,end
- It's not a big deal.
- Who did that, her mother? Good job.

00:14:25.097 --> 00:14:27.600 line:95%,end
No, it was not her mother,
because she didn't see her cry

00:14:27.666 --> 00:14:30.302 line:95%,end
until she came down and went
into the bathroom and saw her cry.

00:14:30.369 --> 00:14:33.005 line:95%,end
And what did Asia tell you
after I told her to tell you.

00:14:33.072 --> 00:14:34.173 line:95%,end
Tell [inaudible] why she was crying.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.908 line:95%,end
After your discussion in the bathroom,

00:14:35.975 --> 00:14:39.712 line:95%,end
she came out and said, I was crying
because I felt sad for Nia.

00:14:40.346 --> 00:14:42.014 line:95%,end
But I don't believe that she was crying--

00:14:42.114 --> 00:14:43.215 line:95%,end
It doesn't matter.

00:14:43.382 --> 00:14:44.683 line:95%,end
--because I think she was tired,

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:47.753 line:95%,end
and tired of working and she cried.
She broke down.

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:49.054 line:95%,end
Kristie, what do you think about this?

00:14:49.121 --> 00:14:51.490 line:95%,end
Asia being here,
and Abby said it, she's seven.

00:14:51.624 --> 00:14:55.027 line:95%,end
I mean, I actually said to you
like I really liked you.

00:14:55.094 --> 00:14:58.364 line:95%,end
I think that you had
other things going on, to be fair,


00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:00.933 line:95%,end
and I think that you were
just sort of in a bad place.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.068 line:95%,end
- And then-- No no.
- What kind of place?

00:15:03.135 --> 00:15:04.236 line:95%,end
Well, you--

00:15:04.303 --> 00:15:08.340 line:95%,end
Well, no, it stemmed from it,
but Jill started twisting the story.

00:15:08.407 --> 00:15:10.209 line:95%,end
I just said the story, how it went.

00:15:10.276 --> 00:15:11.944 line:95%,end
- No, but when you say that--
- There was nothing to twist.

00:15:12.011 --> 00:15:14.246 line:95%,end
But when you say that, Jill,
yes, my daughter's seven.

00:15:14.313 --> 00:15:15.781 line:95%,end
- Right.
- And she's allowed to cry.

00:15:15.848 --> 00:15:16.916 line:95%,end
Absolutely.

00:15:17.016 --> 00:15:19.285 line:95%,end
But I think you have a problem
because Kendall cries all the time.

I know, she wears her heart--
I don't have to hide it.

00:15:21.854 --> 00:15:23.555 line:95%,end
- You have to hide it.
- Why do I hide it?

00:15:23.622 --> 00:15:24.990 line:95%,end
Because she ran into the bathroom

00:15:25.057 --> 00:15:27.259 line:95%,end
and you went in and said,
don't tell them you were crying.

00:15:27.326 --> 00:15:28.928 line:95%,end
No, I did not, Jill.

00:15:29.395 --> 00:15:33.332 line:95%,end
My problem with all the tears is

00:15:33.399 --> 00:15:40.406 line:95%,end
these are children who are healthy,
come from good homes,

00:15:41.006 --> 00:15:43.876 line:95%,end
they all have a mom
and a dad in the house,

00:15:44.643 --> 00:15:47.846 line:95%,end
they are getting to dance
on national television week

00:15:47.913 --> 00:15:49.848 line:95%,end
after week after week.

00:15:50.182 --> 00:15:51.550 line:95%,end
Why are they crying?

00:15:51.617 --> 00:15:55.120 line:95%,end
There's kids in Pittsburgh
that don't have food to eat,

00:15:55.187 --> 00:15:57.189 line:95%,end
that don't have a house--
- I don't think anyone--

00:15:57.256 --> 00:15:58.524 line:95%,end
--that don't have heat.

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:00.059 line:95%,end
- I don't think--
- Those kids should be crying.

00:16:00.125 --> 00:16:01.727 line:95%,end
- I don't think anyone is denying that.
- Excuse me.

00:16:01.827 --> 00:16:03.729 line:95%,end
Those kids should be
crying, not these kids that

00:16:03.862 --> 00:16:05.631 line:95%,end
are in dancing school.

00:16:05.764 --> 00:16:10.069 line:95%,end
It's supposed to be artistic
and graceful and fun.

00:16:10.169 --> 00:16:14.840 line:95%,end
I think that there's just bigger things
in the world to be crying about.

00:16:14.907 --> 00:16:18.177 line:95%,end
Do you think we want our kids to cry?
Because you're wrong.

00:16:18.477 --> 00:16:20.145 line:95%,end
Of course there are bigger, better things.

00:16:20.212 --> 00:16:22.982 line:95%,end
You're faulting these children because
they have all these things.

00:16:23.048 --> 00:16:24.917 line:95%,end
So what?
They're still human beings.

00:16:25.184 --> 00:16:28.387 line:95%,end
I don't know when crying became a crime.

00:16:29.288 --> 00:16:30.856 line:95%,end
When it happens four times a week.

00:16:30.923 --> 00:16:33.425 line:95%,end
Ease up on them.
Maybe they wouldn't cry so much.

00:16:33.926 --> 00:16:35.327 line:95%,end
Well, you know, what's interesting is

00:16:35.427 --> 00:16:37.529 line:95%,end
Kristie Ray's out here,
and she says that

00:16:37.596 --> 00:16:39.431 line:95%,end
because of her background
and her husband's background

00:16:39.498 --> 00:16:40.632 line:95%,end
that she actually agrees with Abby.

00:16:40.699 --> 00:16:41.967 line:95%,end
Yeah. You know what?

00:16:42.034 --> 00:16:43.535 line:95%,end
Kristie said herself
she has another daughter

00:16:43.635 --> 00:16:44.737 line:95%,end
who's different from Asia.

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:46.939 line:95%,end
I have another daughter
who's different from Chloe.

00:16:47.006 --> 00:16:48.407 line:95%,end
Everybody is different.

00:16:48.474 --> 00:16:50.576 line:95%,end
It was almost like she was saying

00:16:50.642 --> 00:16:52.878 line:95%,end
I raised her better than you guys,
but we're saying--

00:16:52.945 --> 00:16:54.413 line:95%,end
- Whatever.
- No, no.

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:57.149 line:95%,end
That's what you heard because
you must be feeling something that--

00:16:57.216 --> 00:16:59.251 line:95%,end
- No, don't put words in my mouth.
- You just said that.

00:16:59.318 --> 00:17:00.552 line:95%,end
I'm saying
they're different kids than Asia.

00:17:00.619 --> 00:17:03.222 line:95%,end
OK, well, if they're going
to cry over what Abby says to them,

00:17:03.322 --> 00:17:04.923 line:95%,end
they're not going to
make it in the world of dance,

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:06.358 line:95%,end
where there's more critique.
- Then you know what?

00:17:06.425 --> 00:17:07.559 line:95%,end
They're not. They're not.

00:17:07.659 --> 00:17:09.261 line:95%,end
You can't come in be
here for three weeks--

00:17:09.328 --> 00:17:10.429 line:95%,end
They're not.

00:17:10.529 --> 00:17:11.764 line:95%,end
--and know
what our kids have gone through.

00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:13.732 line:95%,end
Well, you know, I don't have
to be here for three weeks

00:17:13.799 --> 00:17:16.735 line:95%,end
to see with my own eyes
what happened in three weeks.

00:17:17.236 --> 00:17:19.338 line:95%,end
- I haven't heard so much complaining--
- That's just your opinion.

00:17:19.438 --> 00:17:22.441 line:95%,end
--and whining about someone teaching
your kids and not--

00:17:22.508 --> 00:17:23.976 line:95%,end
What did I tell you about that?

00:17:24.043 --> 00:17:25.978 line:95%,end
You know what, if you don't
like it, you need to leave.

00:17:26.078 --> 00:17:27.479 line:95%,end
No, what did I tell you
about that, Kristie.

00:17:27.546 --> 00:17:29.014 line:95%,end
If it's that hurtful to your kids,

00:17:29.148 --> 00:17:31.350 line:95%,end
you need to be mothers
and do the right thing for your kids.

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:33.819 line:95%,end
If they're crying too much,
you need to pack up and leave.

00:17:34.019 --> 00:17:36.455 line:95%,end
Our kids cry.
I mean, Sophie cries, doesn't she?

00:17:36.588 --> 00:17:37.656 line:95%,end
Yeah.

00:17:37.723 --> 00:17:39.258 line:95%,end
I mean, there's nothing wrong
with crying.

00:17:39.425 --> 00:17:41.593 line:95%,end
Her daughter is like well rehearsed.

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:44.930 line:95%,end
She goes, I love tough love, Miss Abby.
I mean, she's so rehearsed.

00:17:44.997 --> 00:17:46.331 line:95%,end
It's just ridiculous.

00:17:46.398 --> 00:17:48.400 line:95%,end
Kristie, everybody wants to know,
are you going to come back?

00:17:48.867 --> 00:17:52.638 line:95%,end
You know, Asia loves Abby,
and it's all up to Asia.

00:17:52.771 --> 00:17:54.473 line:95%,end
So it's looking good.

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:56.141 line:95%,end
So what do you girls think about that?

00:17:56.275 --> 00:17:59.311 line:95%,end
- I don't mind.
- She poses no threat to the kid.

00:17:59.411 --> 00:18:00.846 line:95%,end
So she's not-- you don't feel like she's--

00:18:00.913 --> 00:18:03.916 line:95%,end
No. I think if Asia was 11,
it might be a different story.

00:18:04.016 --> 00:18:07.553 line:95%,end
But she's a hot mess in the group dances.
She messes up every group dance she's in.

00:18:07.619 --> 00:18:10.656 line:95%,end
So why would you bring her in?
And that came from her, not me.

00:18:10.722 --> 00:18:12.424 line:95%,end
Because that's why she's there, to learn.

00:18:12.491 --> 00:18:14.593 line:95%,end
That's why I expect
that she will be back,

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:15.828 line:95%,end
'cause that's what you want for her.
- The longer I train her--

00:18:15.894 --> 00:18:17.463 line:95%,end
Doesn't matter to me.

00:18:17.529 --> 00:18:20.299 line:95%,end
--the more time I spend with her,
the more lessons learned,

00:18:20.365 --> 00:18:21.834 line:95%,end
the better she fits in.
- Mm-hmm.

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:23.735 line:95%,end
So Jill, do you feel like in any way

00:18:23.802 --> 00:18:26.004 line:95%,end
that if Asia does come back
to this studio,

00:18:26.105 --> 00:18:27.739 line:95%,end
that she would be taking
Abby's attention

00:18:27.806 --> 00:18:29.508 line:95%,end
that maybe Kendall might be getting?

00:18:29.575 --> 00:18:32.244 line:95%,end
When there's seven kids
and then there's eight,

00:18:32.377 --> 00:18:36.014 line:95%,end
that means her attention is divided
eight ways instead of seven.

00:18:36.215 --> 00:18:39.151 line:95%,end
- So it affects all the children.
- I actually would like Asia to come back.

00:18:39.251 --> 00:18:41.987 line:95%,end
And I said there was a lot
of kerfluffling going on

00:18:42.054 --> 00:18:45.157 line:95%,end

and I would love to see them compete.

00:18:45.457 --> 00:18:47.059 line:95%,end
I would.
And I said that to you.

00:18:47.159 --> 00:18:49.661 line:95%,end
I want them to come back
because I think that

00:18:49.728 --> 00:18:51.597 line:95%,end

showdown.

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:13.298 line:95%,end
You know, I want to train the kids.

00:22:13.398 --> 00:22:16.335 line:95%,end
I feel that Asia is at
our studio now training.

00:22:16.568 --> 00:22:19.871 line:95%,end
If Sophia wanted that,
Sophia would get that.

00:22:20.105 --> 00:22:21.173 line:95%,end
OK.

00:22:21.239 --> 00:22:23.175 line:95%,end
So let's talk to Sophia's mom right now.

00:22:23.241 --> 00:22:25.010 line:95%,end
Please welcome Jackie.
Jackie, come on out.

00:22:25.177 --> 00:22:26.678 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:22:29.047 --> 00:22:30.749 line:95%,end
Wow. Hi, how are you?

00:22:30.816 --> 00:22:32.317 line:95%,end
- Hello.
- It's good to see you.

00:22:32.417 --> 00:22:33.919 line:95%,end
- How are you?
- It's really good to have you.

00:22:34.019 --> 00:22:35.287 line:95%,end
Have a seat.
- Thank you.

00:22:35.354 --> 00:22:37.489 line:95%,end
- So Jackie, welcome to the group.
- Thanks.

00:22:37.589 --> 00:22:39.424 line:95%,end
So listen, there's a rumor
going around that didn't

00:22:39.524 --> 00:22:41.059 line:95%,end
Melissa and Kelly run you off the team?

00:22:41.259 --> 00:22:45.597 line:95%,end
I think that for me as a mom,
I don't want my daughter


00:22:45.664 --> 00:22:49.201 line:95%,end
growing up and thinking that
the behavior that I saw,

00:22:49.267 --> 00:22:52.404 line:95%,end
the fighting,
the screaming, the putting down,

00:22:52.537 --> 00:22:54.873 line:95%,end
the yelling between each other--
I don't like that.

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:57.909 line:95%,end
And dance isn't about that for me.
It's an art.

00:22:57.976 --> 00:23:00.345 line:95%,end
And for my daughters, this is her passion,

00:23:00.545 --> 00:23:05.050 line:95%,end
and I don't want her to have these
experiences where it's negative.

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:08.854 line:95%,end
All right, I need out there
because I want to ask that woman

00:23:09.621 --> 00:23:12.190 line:95%,end
why I wouldn't have taken her
off of this team?

00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:13.959 line:95%,end
I was nothing but nice to that woman.

00:23:14.025 --> 00:23:16.161 line:95%,end
It's my job as a mom to protect her,

00:23:16.428 --> 00:23:21.333 line:95%,end
and I think that was my main concern
for staying on the team.

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:24.469 line:95%,end
I just want our kids
to be seen in a good light.

00:23:24.636 --> 00:23:27.939 line:95%,end
I don't want people to think that
it's all about the screaming and yelling.

00:23:28.006 --> 00:23:29.574 line:95%,end
When they see our kids,
I want them to see what

00:23:29.708 --> 00:23:30.909 line:95%,end
great kids they are and not--

00:23:31.076 --> 00:23:32.677 line:95%,end
I think people do see
what great kids they are.

00:23:32.744 --> 00:23:33.845 line:95%,end
--and not us moms.

00:23:33.979 --> 00:23:36.415 line:95%,end
I'm really appalled at
how you started out the situation,

00:23:36.681 --> 00:23:40.085 line:95%,end
because Maddie was with me last night
when I taught a master class.

00:23:40.385 --> 00:23:42.587 line:95%,end
I have made your kid's name
a household name.

00:23:42.687 --> 00:23:44.089 line:95%,end
I agree with that.

00:23:44.156 --> 00:23:45.424 line:95%,end
If she was running around
the dance competitions

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:47.325 line:95%,end
in Pittsburgh, she wouldn't be
a household name.

00:23:47.392 --> 00:23:49.227 line:95%,end
- I agree with you.
- She'd be a competition kid.

00:23:49.461 --> 00:23:53.298 line:95%,end
I think that you have
made my kids what they are.

00:23:53.365 --> 00:23:55.133 line:95%,end
- Don't back-paddle, Melissa.
- But you have.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.368 line:95%,end
Don't back-paddle.

00:23:56.435 --> 00:23:58.970 line:95%,end
Let Melissa fight her own battles, right?

00:23:59.137 --> 00:24:01.473 line:95%,end
It [bleep] drives me crazy.

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:03.475 line:95%,end
[interposing voices]

00:24:07.179 --> 00:24:11.016 line:95%,end
I mean, somebody is always fighting
Melissa's battles for her.

00:24:11.082 --> 00:24:15.086 line:95%,end
Like you're the total antithesis
of Asia and her mom.

00:24:15.187 --> 00:24:16.288 line:95%,end
[laughs]

00:24:16.388 --> 00:24:17.556 line:95%,end
I mean, really, think about it.

00:24:17.622 --> 00:24:21.126 line:95%,end
Like she's here specifically
to learn from Abby,

00:24:21.193 --> 00:24:22.928 line:95%,end
to get her name out there.

00:24:23.161 --> 00:24:25.397 line:95%,end
The thing that I was going to say to you
is that she also believes

00:24:25.497 --> 00:24:28.066 line:95%,end
that she doesn't want Asia
to peak too soon.

00:24:28.133 --> 00:24:29.434 line:95%,end
I agree with that.

00:24:29.501 --> 00:24:31.937 line:95%,end
By making everything so
rosy and not having any drama.

00:24:32.003 --> 00:24:33.538 line:95%,end
Well, Sophia gets critiques all the time.

00:24:33.605 --> 00:24:35.207 line:95%,end
Sophia doesn't always win, you guys.

00:24:35.307 --> 00:24:38.176 line:95%,end
Like, I know that that may be,
like, what everybody thinks.

00:24:38.243 --> 00:24:40.912 line:95%,end
But when she doesn't,
it actually lights a fire under her butt.

00:24:41.112 --> 00:24:42.414 line:95%,end
She's like, you know what?

00:24:42.514 --> 00:24:44.516 line:95%,end
I'm going to work hard
because I can do that.

00:24:45.116 --> 00:24:47.352 line:95%,end
Jackie, do you think
you'll regret leaving?

00:24:47.419 --> 00:24:48.954 line:95%,end
No, I hope I don't regret it.

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:51.289 line:95%,end
This is about my daughter, not about me.

00:24:51.356 --> 00:24:53.124 line:95%,end
I know this sounds crazy to everybody,

00:24:53.391 --> 00:24:56.561 line:95%,end
but there's just a little
tiny bit of me in Sophia.

00:24:56.661 --> 00:24:58.296 line:95%,end
[laughter]

00:24:58.763 --> 00:25:01.066 line:95%,end
And I'm not talking about
the turns or the talent.

00:25:01.132 --> 00:25:02.634 line:95%,end
It's that like moxie.

00:25:02.701 --> 00:25:06.104 line:95%,end
She told me that,
at her studio back in California,

00:25:06.271 --> 00:25:08.874 line:95%,end
that she assists with
the little preschool classes.

00:25:08.974 --> 00:25:12.310 line:95%,end
She said, and I'm really mean.
I can even make them cry.

00:25:13.111 --> 00:25:16.414 line:95%,end
And I said, oh, my God.
It's mini me. I love this kid.

00:25:17.649 --> 00:25:20.585 line:95%,end
God, she takes credit
for everything, doesn't she?

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:24.289 line:95%,end
Maybe Abby's God
and we just don't know it.

00:25:24.356 --> 00:25:26.625 line:95%,end
- What do you think, Holly?
- She has told me that.

00:25:26.691 --> 00:25:27.926 line:95%,end
Does she kind of resemble--

00:25:28.026 --> 00:25:29.761 line:95%,end
does she resemble those pictures
in the Bible?

00:25:29.928 --> 00:25:31.930 line:95%,end
No. No.
Abby and I got into it about that.

00:25:32.364 --> 00:25:34.799 line:95%,end
Let's take some questions
from the audience. Who has a question?

00:25:35.066 --> 00:25:36.635 line:95%,end
Hi, Jackie.

00:25:36.701 --> 00:25:40.839 line:95%,end
Do you feel like you think that
Sophia can out-dance Maddie?

00:25:41.506 --> 00:25:43.942 line:95%,end
I don't think that Sophia
and Maddie should ever

00:25:44.209 --> 00:25:45.644 line:95%,end
be compared to one another.

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:47.512 line:95%,end
It's kind of sad because I think
America would like to see them

00:25:47.612 --> 00:25:49.214 line:95%,end
go against each other,

00:25:49.314 --> 00:25:51.349 line:95%,end
but somebody's always going to win
and somebody's always going to lose.

00:25:51.416 --> 00:25:53.151 line:95%,end
It's the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:25:53.251 --> 00:25:55.787 line:95%,end
In the end, I make the decisions.

00:25:56.121 --> 00:25:58.890 line:95%,end
However, I want a strong team.

00:25:58.957 --> 00:26:02.594 line:95%,end
So I think with both of them
on the same team,

00:26:03.128 --> 00:26:04.996 line:95%,end
that's going to be one strong team.
- Mm-hmm.

00:26:05.096 --> 00:26:07.799 line:95%,end
And then you'd have to
fight the other dancers

00:26:07.933 --> 00:26:12.604 line:95%,end
that match that talent,
or I have to create them.

I want to start with you.

00:28:27.906 --> 00:28:31.509 line:95%,end
You guys were backstage
when Jackie and Kristie Ray were out here.

00:28:31.609 --> 00:28:34.746 line:95%,end
I have invested a lot of time
in Abby's studio with my daughter.

00:28:34.846 --> 00:28:38.616 line:95%,end
And having two moms come in,
I don't know them.

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:42.587 line:95%,end
There's nothing against them personally.
They look to be lovely people.

00:28:43.188 --> 00:28:46.558 line:95%,end
But to have Abby talk
so negatively about us,

00:28:46.624 --> 00:28:49.761 line:95%,end
we've been loyal customers
and our children

00:28:49.828 --> 00:28:52.797 line:95%,end
are products of her teaching,

Why do you stay?

00:28:57.602 --> 00:29:00.171 line:95%,end

Mia likes Abby.

we were a group of moms
who've been together for a long time.

00:29:11.649 --> 00:29:16.087 line:95%,end

we all deserve to be here.

You know, where were you guys

So what changed your mind?

what it was like and here I am.

00:29:24.863 --> 00:29:26.097 line:95%,end
So.

00:29:26.164 --> 00:29:28.233 line:95%,end
Well, I have a bone to pick about that.

I was dropping Kristie

00:29:46.518 --> 00:29:47.752 line:95%,end
You were very nice to me.

00:29:47.819 --> 00:29:50.188 line:95%,end
But you're saying to people that

00:29:50.655 --> 00:29:51.756 line:95%,end
I made you leave the studio.

And I remember that day.

00:29:53.024 --> 00:29:55.059 line:95%,end
I didn't say to anybody
that you made me leave.

00:30:01.499 --> 00:30:04.235 line:95%,end
Hi. So my question is this season
it seems like

00:30:04.335 --> 00:30:06.304 line:95%,end
Cathy has kind of dominated
the competitions.

00:30:06.371 --> 00:30:08.439 line:95%,end
Are you worried about
the future competitions?

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:12.210 line:95%,end
Cathy's team, those boys
are much older than our girls,

00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:15.580 line:95%,end
and they're different dancers
and they're teenagers,

00:30:15.647 --> 00:30:18.149 line:95%,end
and it's like comparing
apples and oranges.

00:30:18.283 --> 00:30:21.085 line:95%,end
I don't even think
that it's that they're older.

00:30:21.386 --> 00:30:23.855 line:95%,end
These girls came to Abby's studio

00:30:23.922 --> 00:30:27.759 line:95%,end
at two years old
and danced from then till now.

00:30:27.992 --> 00:30:31.863 line:95%,end
And if we win or lose
as a team, who cares?

00:30:32.163 --> 00:30:34.532 line:95%,end
We're a team.
We didn't handpick our team.

00:30:34.766 --> 00:30:37.969 line:95%,end
We are who we grew up with
and who we were taught with,

00:30:38.203 --> 00:30:39.671 line:95%,end
and that's what counts.

00:30:39.737 --> 00:30:41.306 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:30:41.706 --> 00:30:44.242 line:95%,end
Well, since all of you have
something to say about Cathy,

00:30:44.509 --> 00:30:46.211 line:95%,end
Cathy, come on out.

00:30:46.277 --> 00:30:47.745 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:30:47.812 --> 00:30:50.315 line:95%,end
Here she comes.
Hello, madame.

00:30:50.648 --> 00:30:52.350 line:95%,end
How are you? have a seat.

00:30:53.585 --> 00:30:55.453 line:95%,end
- Cathy, you've been doing really well.
- Very well.

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:56.988 line:95%,end
And it's rubbing some
people the wrong way.

00:30:57.055 --> 00:30:58.923 line:95%,end
Oh, yes it is, lots of people.

00:30:59.090 --> 00:31:01.226 line:95%,end
What's your strategy?

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:04.495 line:95%,end
You know, it's a happy environment.

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:08.533 line:95%,end
The boys are very, very happy.
They don't get yelled at.

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:10.435 line:95%,end
So that says something in itself,

00:31:10.535 --> 00:31:13.872 line:95%,end
you can produce
without screaming and yelling.

00:31:15.073 --> 00:31:19.310 line:95%,end
So if you could have any dancer,
who would it be?

00:31:19.878 --> 00:31:21.279 line:95%,end
I know exactly who it would be,

00:31:21.346 --> 00:31:24.048 line:95%,end
and it's probably going to shock
her pantyhose right off of her,

00:31:24.148 --> 00:31:26.751 line:95%,end
although she doesn't have pantyhose.
Ew, and she didn't shave, either.

00:31:26.885 --> 00:31:28.920 line:95%,end
I have laser hair removal.

00:31:28.987 --> 00:31:30.221 line:95%,end
[laughter]

00:31:30.288 --> 00:31:33.124 line:95%,end
Well, anyhow, it's not working for you,
babe. You got stubble.

00:31:33.191 --> 00:31:35.426 line:95%,end
Anyhow, I would choose Chloe.

00:31:35.493 --> 00:31:37.195 line:95%,end
Would you dress her up in a meat suit?

00:31:37.262 --> 00:31:39.364 line:95%,end
No, I wouldn't.
I would choose Chloe because

00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:40.899 line:95%,end
I know that Abby would love
to get rid of her.

00:31:40.999 --> 00:31:43.167 line:95%,end
She doesn't realize that
she's got a little hidden pearl.

00:31:43.268 --> 00:31:45.837 line:95%,end
Thank you, Cathy. That's actually
nice of you. I appreciate it.

00:31:45.937 --> 00:31:50.008 line:95%,end
And if Chloe would come to my studio,
Kristie would probably have a good time

00:31:50.174 --> 00:31:52.510 line:95%,end
bantering back and forth with me,
but she would see that Chloe--

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:53.845 line:95%,end
Let's not get crazy.

00:31:53.912 --> 00:31:55.179 line:95%,end
--was treated nicely.

00:31:55.246 --> 00:31:57.215 line:95%,end
I don't know.
I mean, this is her team.

00:31:57.282 --> 00:31:59.517 line:95%,end
I'm not willing to just
walk away from a team.

00:31:59.584 --> 00:32:01.252 line:95%,end
Talk to me at some point.

00:32:01.419 --> 00:32:03.421 line:95%,end
Well, no wait a minute.
He asked me a question.

00:32:03.488 --> 00:32:05.456 line:95%,end
- I know.
- Figuratively speaking, who it would be.

00:32:05.623 --> 00:32:07.091 line:95%,end
- Yes.
- I'm not giving you a proposal.

00:32:07.158 --> 00:32:08.226 line:95%,end
[laughter]

00:32:08.326 --> 00:32:09.460 line:95%,end
I'm not taking it as a proposal.

00:32:09.527 --> 00:32:10.561 line:95%,end
OK, good.

00:32:10.628 --> 00:32:12.063 line:95%,end
I'm saying even just thinking of that,

00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:13.698 line:95%,end
because Jeff just alluded to that,

00:32:13.765 --> 00:32:16.768 line:95%,end
I'm saying I don't think Chloe
would walk away from her team.

00:32:16.968 --> 00:32:19.470 line:95%,end
Well, at some point,
you're going to get to the point

00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:22.140 line:95%,end
where the straw breaks the camel's back.

00:32:22.607 --> 00:32:25.343 line:95%,end
So you know that that's my thoughts
and it's not a proposal,

00:32:25.443 --> 00:32:27.412 line:95%,end
but I think it was very nice
and noble of me

00:32:27.478 --> 00:32:29.480 line:95%,end
to say that about her because I think
she's a nice little girl. -

00:32:29.614 --> 00:32:30.982 line:95%,end
Oh, Cathy, you are nice and noble.
Thank you.

00:32:31.082 --> 00:32:33.251 line:95%,end
Let's go to the audience and find out who
has a question for you guys.

00:32:33.351 --> 00:32:35.553 line:95%,end
Cathy, I was wondering, if you would have

00:32:35.653 --> 00:32:38.356 line:95%,end
any of these moms babysit little Vivi,

00:32:38.456 --> 00:32:41.059 line:95%,end
which one would you not pick to babysit?

00:32:41.125 --> 00:32:43.161 line:95%,end
I would not pick Kristie.

00:32:43.328 --> 00:32:45.063 line:95%,end
- I would not--
- Vivi would have fun with me.

00:32:45.129 --> 00:32:46.531 line:95%,end
I would not pick Kelly.

00:32:46.631 --> 00:32:49.067 line:95%,end
I would definitely not pick Jill
because I just don't like her.

00:32:49.133 --> 00:32:52.470 line:95%,end
I would probably pick Holly or Melissa.

00:32:52.971 --> 00:32:54.505 line:95%,end
All right, who else in the audience
has a question

00:32:54.572 --> 00:32:56.074 line:95%,end
for Cathy or one of the moms?

00:32:56.174 --> 00:32:58.376 line:95%,end
Cathy, I've heard that your
favorite show is

00:32:58.476 --> 00:33:01.746 line:95%,end
"Downtown Abbey," so I'd like to know
which character you think

00:33:01.813 --> 00:33:04.349 line:95%,end
fits you best
and which character fits Abby best?

00:33:04.515 --> 00:33:07.051 line:95%,end
I think that I'm a little bit like Mary.

00:33:07.385 --> 00:33:09.854 line:95%,end
And I don't think that there is a car--

00:33:09.988 --> 00:33:11.923 line:95%,end
[laughs] I said a car.

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:14.625 line:95%,end
I don't think that there
is anybody like Abby,

00:33:14.726 --> 00:33:18.463 line:95%,end
other than the car that drives around
in a circle to pick up the people.

00:33:18.563 --> 00:33:20.531 line:95%,end
[laughter]

00:33:20.698 --> 00:33:24.302 line:95%,end
She doesn't have the class
for that show, in my opinion.

00:33:24.369 --> 00:33:25.737 line:95%,end
All right, so thanks, ladies.

00:33:25.803 --> 00:33:28.306 line:95%,end
And thank you, Kristie Ray
and Jackie for your honesty.

00:33:28.439 --> 00:33:30.708 line:95%,end
After the break,
Abby returns, plus

00:33:30.808 --> 00:33:33.778 line:95%,end
there's one more incredible group
number by the girls.

00:33:34.012 --> 00:33:36.214 line:95%,end
(SINGING) Living on the dance floor.


00:33:38.816 --> 00:33:41.152 line:95%,end
You look like you were,
you know, about to hit the wing,

00:33:41.219 --> 00:33:43.021 line:95%,end
so it shows on your face.
- Uh-uh.

00:33:43.087 --> 00:33:45.356 line:95%,end
You're not her dance teacher.
Don't rip on my daughter.

00:33:45.456 --> 00:33:47.091 line:95%,end
- She does it enough.
- Well, I pay her.

00:33:47.158 --> 00:33:48.760 line:95%,end
Maybe you should get a refund
because those knees were bent.

00:33:48.826 --> 00:33:51.062 line:95%,end
- She missed many a steps.
- All right, look.

00:33:51.229 --> 00:33:53.531 line:95%,end
This is a dance competition.
I've had it.

00:33:53.598 --> 00:33:55.299 line:95%,end
I hope you're happy.
Now my kid's leaving.

00:33:55.366 --> 00:33:58.636 line:95%,end
Don't you touch me.
Don't you touch me.

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:00.838 line:95%,end
As you can see, Abby's joined us.

00:34:00.938 --> 00:34:03.641 line:95%,end
So Abby, Cathy says that
when you go to the competitions

00:34:03.708 --> 00:34:07.345 line:95%,end
that, lately, you completely ignore her,
that you won't even look at her.

00:34:07.979 --> 00:34:10.281 line:95%,end
She just really doesn't exist
in my world anymore.

00:34:10.381 --> 00:34:12.016 line:95%,end
She [inaudible] me.

00:34:13.518 --> 00:34:17.055 line:95%,end
I think that Abby is acting
ridiculous over what happened,

00:34:17.255 --> 00:34:20.358 line:95%,end
and I think that the way
that she's carrying on about this

00:34:20.458 --> 00:34:24.362 line:95%,end
is more than the swat with the handbag.

00:34:24.662 --> 00:34:28.800 line:95%,end
Abby is upset because
somebody now is maybe

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.436 line:95%,end
interfering with her thunder.

00:34:31.936 --> 00:34:34.238 line:95%,end
And you know,
you have a lot of thunder to give,

00:34:34.372 --> 00:34:37.775 line:95%,end
and I'm not saying that nasty
because you're a large woman.

00:34:39.177 --> 00:34:42.380 line:95%,end
I'm saying that
because you have a great team.

00:34:42.713 --> 00:34:47.452 line:95%,end
But you are carrying on like a brat.

00:34:47.518 --> 00:34:49.020 line:95%,end
We've known each other
for a very long time.

00:34:49.087 --> 00:34:50.555 line:95%,end
I'm an only child. I am a spoiled brat.

00:34:50.655 --> 00:34:52.924 line:95%,end
Well, you know, when I'm an
only child, too, though, Abby.

00:34:52.990 --> 00:34:55.293 line:95%,end
Yeah. Look at your poor,
pathetic mother out there.

00:34:55.493 --> 00:34:56.894 line:95%,end
You disgraced her.

00:34:58.296 --> 00:35:02.300 line:95%,end
- Did you just call my mother pathetic?
- Yes. Poor, pathetic.

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.368 line:95%,end
She's a disgrace.
- Oh, my God. I'll tell you what, Abby.

00:35:04.469 --> 00:35:07.238 line:5%,start
\You really know how to win friends
and influence people.

00:35:07.305 --> 00:35:08.372 line:95%,end
You know what, Cathy?

00:35:08.439 --> 00:35:11.676 line:95%,end
Crap like you should be shoved down
a toilet. That's it.

00:35:11.776 --> 00:35:17.648 line:95%,end
Abby, before this show came about,
we competed three times against you,

00:35:17.715 --> 00:35:20.618 line:95%,end
and two of those
three times we beat you.

00:35:20.918 --> 00:35:22.587 line:95%,end
So that's how crappy I am.

00:35:22.687 --> 00:35:25.389 line:95%,end
I had an eight-year-old
beat your 12-year-old

00:35:25.523 --> 00:35:27.892 line:95%,end
for a grand national title
in New York City.

00:35:28.092 --> 00:35:29.827 line:95%,end
Time out.
Time out.

00:35:30.094 --> 00:35:32.730 line:95%,end
- There's no time out, Abby.
- Cathy, Cathy.

00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:35.032 line:95%,end
- Abby.
- You're paddling upstream, sweetheart.

00:35:35.166 --> 00:35:37.368 line:95%,end
- It's over. It's over.
- No.

00:35:37.435 --> 00:35:39.103 line:95%,end
Look at your own kid.

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:41.405 line:95%,end
- Yeah, don't start on my kid, Abby.
- Oh, yes.

00:35:41.506 --> 00:35:43.875 line:95%,end
Because you are so obsessed with her
you can't see straight.

00:35:43.941 --> 00:35:45.543 line:95%,end
Look at how Mackenzie's improved.

00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:47.845 line:95%,end
I don't think Mackenzie's
improved that much.

00:35:47.912 --> 00:35:50.515 line:95%,end
I watched her last week in her dance.

00:35:50.882 --> 00:35:53.551 line:95%,end
Her bent knees, and she could
barely do the choreography.

00:35:53.618 --> 00:35:56.554 line:95%,end
It takes a lot more courage
to get on that stage

00:35:56.654 --> 00:35:58.289 line:95%,end
and dance with bent knees--

00:35:58.389 --> 00:35:59.891 line:95%,end
You out of control, Abby.

00:35:59.957 --> 00:36:02.160 line:95%,end
--and unpointed feet
than to sit in the audience and watch.

00:36:02.226 --> 00:36:05.062 line:95%,end
You know what? Time out.
This argument is between Abby and I.

00:36:05.129 --> 00:36:06.797 line:95%,end
No, because it's my kid
you're talking about.

00:36:06.898 --> 00:36:07.999 line:95%,end
I'm not talking about your kid.

00:36:08.099 --> 00:36:09.333 line:95%,end
You're talking about my kid.
[interposing voices]

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:12.103 line:95%,end
No, no, no, no.
This gets a little ridiculous.

00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:14.138 line:95%,end
I was not even talking.

00:36:14.205 --> 00:36:16.941 line:95%,end
She was conversing with Anthony,
and all of a sudden--

00:36:17.008 --> 00:36:19.844 line:95%,end
But he was your choreographer
so you are responsible for her.

00:36:19.911 --> 00:36:22.213 line:95%,end
Honey, I didn't stick my hand
up his [bleep] and make him

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:23.748 line:95%,end
a ventriloquist and make him talk.

00:36:23.814 --> 00:36:25.616 line:95%,end
Well, maybe because you say
I do that to Melissa.

00:36:25.683 --> 00:36:27.985 line:95%,end
I didn't do it to him.
He can talk how he wants.

00:36:28.286 --> 00:36:32.523 line:95%,end
And if your kid is always behind
in rehearsals or in the dance,

00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:34.425 line:95%,end
then you should talk to her,

00:36:34.525 --> 00:36:36.827 line:95%,end
because obviously she doesn't know
how to coach.

00:36:38.129 --> 00:36:41.065 line:95%,end
I think that all of you ladies
are very, very tacky.

00:36:41.132 --> 00:36:43.267 line:95%,end
[interposing voices]
- Time out. Time out.

00:36:43.334 --> 00:36:45.369 line:95%,end
In front of an audience of 300 people.

00:36:45.469 --> 00:36:48.439 line:95%,end
But your kids are up on stage dancing.

00:36:48.506 --> 00:36:53.444 line:95%,end
The only child on this team that
did not dance today was Paige.

00:36:53.544 --> 00:36:55.146 line:95%,end
- And that's my fault?
- Because she was humiliated--

00:36:55.246 --> 00:36:57.248 line:95%,end
Oh, please, Kelly. Oh, please.
- --three days ago--

00:36:57.381 --> 00:37:00.017 line:95%,end
--from you and your choreographer,
and that's why she didn't dance today.

00:37:00.117 --> 00:37:01.619 line:95%,end
She probably didn't dance today

00:37:01.719 --> 00:37:03.287 line:95%,end
because Abby doesn't give her
any choreography.

00:37:03.354 --> 00:37:07.158 line:95%,end
No. Paige didn't want to go on stage
because she's a horrible dancer

00:37:07.225 --> 00:37:09.427 line:95%,end
because that's all everybody tells her.


00:37:09.527 --> 00:37:11.929 line:95%,end
How about starting with your own teacher?

00:37:14.232 --> 00:37:18.803 line:95%,end
Yes, including Abby, including you,
including your choreographer,

She's fabulous.

Kristie, did you know that Paige

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:41.125 line:95%,end
decided not to dance today--
- I did.

00:37:41.225 --> 00:37:42.460 line:95%,end
-- because she's in a bad space?

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:44.595 line:95%,end
Yeah, but you know,
that's Kelly's decision.

00:37:44.662 --> 00:37:47.698 line:95%,end
It was not my decision
to pull Paige's dance.

00:37:47.798 --> 00:37:49.967 line:95%,end
Paige asked me to pull her dance.

00:37:50.601 --> 00:37:52.036 line:95%,end
You don't get better sitting on your butt.

00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:58.109 line:95%,end
When you called Paige over
to hear Cathy's choreographers' critique,

00:37:58.576 --> 00:38:01.178 line:95%,end
do you regret doing that?
- No, absolutely not.

00:38:01.579 --> 00:38:03.180 line:95%,end
Paige was a hero.

00:38:03.247 --> 00:38:07.285 line:95%,end
I thought once they realized
that they had crossed the line,

00:38:07.418 --> 00:38:11.222 line:95%,end
that they were hurting feelings,
that it was none of their business--

00:38:11.322 --> 00:38:15.092 line:95%,end
Oh, and you never hurt feelings?
You just called my mother pathetic.

00:38:15.159 --> 00:38:17.194 line:95%,end
--and that she's a grown woman,
she's an adult.

00:38:17.295 --> 00:38:20.831 line:95%,end
It doesn't matter.
You just disrespected your elder.

00:38:21.632 --> 00:38:23.801 line:95%,end
I don't care.
She's nothing to me, and neither are you.

00:38:24.769 --> 00:38:27.305 line:95%,end
Well, you're nothing to me,
either, Abby, but a big blob.

00:38:27.371 --> 00:38:28.472 line:95%,end
So go.

00:38:28.572 --> 00:38:31.242 line:95%,end
If you guys want me out,
Abby, do your magic.

00:38:31.309 --> 00:38:33.077 line:95%,end
Do your magic.
- Poof, be gone.

00:38:33.311 --> 00:38:35.780 line:95%,end
- It's not working, wicked witch.
- All right, ladies.

00:38:35.846 --> 00:38:37.281 line:95%,end
I know it got a little heated out here.

00:38:37.348 --> 00:38:39.750 line:95%,end
Thank you so much
for sharing your honest opinions.
