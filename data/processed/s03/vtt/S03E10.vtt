ABBY LEE MILLER (VOICEOVER):
Previously on "Dance Moms."

00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:07.107 line:5%,start
We will be attending In10sity Dance
in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

00:00:07.173 --> 00:00:08.441 line:5%,start
Replace us, that's fine.

00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:10.677 line:5%,start
Chloe is suspended. So is her mother.

00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:14.180 line:5%,start
When I left, there was tension
between Melissa and Abby.

00:00:14.247 --> 00:00:16.016 line:5%,start
At the top of the pyramid, Maddie.

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:19.386 line:5%,start
And it's like I came back,
and everything is back to normal.

00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:22.155 line:5%,start
Your highest scoring
junior soloist, Maddie.

00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:23.490 line:5%,start
[cheering]

00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:24.557 line:5%,start
What happened there?

00:00:24.624 --> 00:00:26.026 line:5%,start
A real friend would have
picked up a phone.

00:00:26.092 --> 00:00:27.193 line:5%,start
[bleep] you.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.695 line:5%,start
[bleep] you.

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:31.264 line:5%,start
ABBY LEE MILLER (VOICEOVER):
Coming up on "Dance Moms."

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:33.800 line:5%,start
Everywhere I look,
there's memories of Baby,

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:36.136 line:5%,start
and I don't know
if I want to leave you alone.

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:38.838 line:5%,start
We were just wondering
if you heard from Abby or anything.

00:00:38.905 --> 00:00:39.906 line:5%,start
No.

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:42.942 line:5%,start
Screwing with my choreography
is very offensive.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.312 line:5%,start
You were kicked out
because she wasn't good enough.

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.714 line:5%,start
No, bitch, I left.

00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:49.416 line:5%,start
You ran back over to that studio,

00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:52.419 line:5%,start
and I see why they don't want you back,
because your kid sucks.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.922 line:5%,start
[MUSIC - NIKKO LOWE, "LIVING ON
THE DANCE FLOOR"]

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:57.490 line:95%,end
(SINGING) Get up.

00:00:57.557 --> 00:00:59.426 line:95%,end
Get on the floor.

00:00:59.492 --> 00:01:04.597 line:95%,end
My world is with my girls
living on the dance floor.

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:08.568 line:95%,end
[music continuing]

00:01:21.347 --> 00:01:22.949 line:95%,end
Isn't there something that says

00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:25.518 line:95%,end
if a teacher doesn't come
within so many minutes, you can leave?

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:28.021 line:5%,start
We all walk into the studio
for rehearsals today,

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:30.790 line:5%,start
and everyone's like, oh, where's Abby?
Where's Abby?

00:01:30.857 --> 00:01:33.593 line:95%,end
And I'm all like, who the hell cares?
Party.

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:37.764 line:95%,end
Hey, girls.

00:01:38.798 --> 00:01:40.033 line:95%,end
Okay.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.801 line:95%,end
This is going to be a rough week for me.

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:44.904 line:95%,end
Broadway Baby passed away.

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:53.413 line:95%,end
She was lethargic,
and I knew something was wrong,

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.182 line:95%,end
but I just thought that
she had eaten something

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:59.486 line:95%,end
that didn't agree with her,
and she was just kind of down and out.

00:01:59.552 --> 00:02:03.156 line:95%,end
But it ended up being kidney failure.

00:02:03.223 --> 00:02:06.659 line:95%,end
I mean, I know she's 16,
but she's your kid.

00:02:06.726 --> 00:02:07.727 line:95%,end
It's like your kid.

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:10.063 line:95%,end
It's hard. I mean, we-- it's hard.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.067 line:95%,end
I've never seen Abby look so sad.
I mean, Baby really was her baby.

00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:16.202 line:95%,end
And even though Abby and I
clearly don't get along,

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.238 line:95%,end
I wouldn't wish this on her
in a million years.

00:02:18.304 --> 00:02:21.774 line:95%,end
I'm here. We need to get ready.

00:02:21.841 --> 00:02:25.678 line:95%,end
We are going to St. Louis
to Dance Expressions.

00:02:25.745 --> 00:02:27.180 line:95%,end
It's a huge competition.

00:02:27.247 --> 00:02:29.849 line:95%,end
I don't want to be here right now.
I don't want to talk about it.

00:02:29.916 --> 00:02:33.386 line:5%,start
I don't want to look at these kids,
but this is what I do.

00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:35.021 line:5%,start
So I put my game face on.

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:37.657 line:95%,end
I came back. I'm here.

00:02:37.724 --> 00:02:39.792 line:95%,end
I need to get these kids
ready for St. Louis.

00:02:40.527 --> 00:02:42.562 line:95%,end
On the bottom, we have Paige.

00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:45.732 line:95%,end
Paige, the reason
you're on the bottom is the duet.

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:51.704 line:95%,end
We, all of us in this room,

00:02:51.771 --> 00:02:54.874 line:95%,end
need to be confident in you,
in your performance.

00:02:54.941 --> 00:02:58.945 line:95%,end
Next on the pyramid is Brooke.

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:02.582 line:95%,end
Brooke, for you
to get in the top five was good.

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:05.385 line:5%,start
For you not to win was bad.

00:03:05.451 --> 00:03:07.687 line:5%,start
The fact that both of my kids
are at the bottom of the pyramid

00:03:07.754 --> 00:03:09.489 line:95%,end
makes me wonder if it's personal.

00:03:09.556 --> 00:03:11.457 line:95%,end
Like is it because Abby doesn't like me?

00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:15.695 line:95%,end
And next, Mackenzie.

00:03:15.762 --> 00:03:18.264 line:95%,end
I thought for you
to be doing the same choreography

00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:20.099 line:95%,end
as a 14-year-old was great.

00:03:20.166 --> 00:03:21.334 line:95%,end
Moving up.

00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:24.704 line:95%,end
Next on the pyramid is Kendall.

00:03:24.771 --> 00:03:27.207 line:95%,end
Kendall, I think you're good at evil.


00:03:27.273 --> 00:03:28.942 line:95%,end
I thought you looked really good
in the costume,

00:03:29.008 --> 00:03:30.977 line:95%,end
and I thought you went out there,
and you sold it.

00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:34.747 line:95%,end
And next, we have Nia.

00:03:34.814 --> 00:03:37.784 line:95%,end
Nia, you're here because, again,

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.087 line:95%,end
your facial expressions,
you told the story.

00:03:41.154 --> 00:03:45.058 line:95%,end
And at the top of the pyramid
once again, Maddie.

00:03:45.124 --> 00:03:48.361 line:95%,end
You went out on that stage,
you danced for your life,

00:03:48.428 --> 00:03:49.796 line:95%,end
and you won.

00:03:49.862 --> 00:03:52.398 line:95%,end
You stayed on top of this pyramid
for another week.

00:03:52.465 --> 00:03:56.436 line:5%,start
I'm so relieved that Maddie is back
to being on top week after week.

00:03:56.502 --> 00:04:00.139 line:95%,end
And I'm so glad that Abby has given her
this opportunity again,

00:04:00.206 --> 00:04:02.041 line:95%,end
and it's given her a lot of confidence.

00:04:02.108 --> 00:04:04.143 line:95%,end
Chloe, just to make things
perfectly clear,

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:05.945 line:95%,end
you are still on suspension.

00:04:06.012 --> 00:04:07.714 line:95%,end
Understood?

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.751 line:95%,end
Moving on, the group routine,
which Mackenzie is not in,

00:04:11.818 --> 00:04:15.722 line:95%,end
it is called
"My Dream Will Be Your Dream."

00:04:15.788 --> 00:04:17.757 line:95%,end
Has a ton of ballet technique in it.

00:04:17.824 --> 00:04:21.027 line:95%,end
So this story is going to be
an epic love story.

00:04:21.728 --> 00:04:24.998 line:95%,end
It's going to be beautiful,
and it's going to be entertaining.

00:04:25.064 --> 00:04:29.102 line:95%,end
I think this piece,
being this big, epic love story,

00:04:29.168 --> 00:04:31.838 line:95%,end
is going to help me remember Baby.

00:04:31.904 --> 00:04:35.208 line:95%,end
Anytime I walk into the studio,
it's an escape.

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:37.410 line:95%,end
Helps me keep my mind off of other things.

00:04:37.477 --> 00:04:40.713 line:95%,end
Now, moms,
I've taken care of the costumes.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.649 line:95%,end
The headpieces are being made.

00:04:42.715 --> 00:04:44.984 line:95%,end
Everything is ready to go.

00:04:45.051 --> 00:04:47.086 line:95%,end
Now, we have some solos.

00:04:47.153 --> 00:04:50.223 line:95%,end
Nia, you're going to be doing a solo.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.892 line:95%,end
The name of your music
is "Breaking My Heart."

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:55.061 line:5%,start
I'm really excited Nia has a solo.

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:58.831 line:5%,start
I just hope that she can take away
some of Abby's grief and not add to it.

00:04:58.898 --> 00:05:01.501 line:95%,end
Maddie, you're also going to have a solo.

00:05:01.567 --> 00:05:05.471 line:95%,end
The name of your routine
is "Showing You My Heart."

00:05:05.538 --> 00:05:07.707 line:95%,end
Just one more thing
I want to remind you of.

00:05:07.774 --> 00:05:11.577 line:95%,end
St. Louis the home of Black Patsy.

00:05:11.644 --> 00:05:15.748 line:95%,end
So, Maddie and Nia, you're going to be
going head to head with Nicaya.

00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:18.151 line:95%,end
Black Patsy is this crazy mom

00:05:18.217 --> 00:05:20.753 line:95%,end
who actually makes us
call her Black Patsy.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.289 line:95%,end
- So what would you like us to call you?
- Black Patsy.

00:05:23.356 --> 00:05:25.191 line:95%,end
- You know who Patsy Ramsey is?
- JILL: Yeah.

00:05:25.258 --> 00:05:27.360 line:95%,end
- Crazy stage mom?
- JILL: That's you.

00:05:27.427 --> 00:05:29.862 line:95%,end
Her daughter danced for the ALDC,

00:05:29.929 --> 00:05:32.598 line:95%,end
and they did not like us,
to say the least.

00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:35.068 line:95%,end
You want to watch your mouth because
I ain't the rest of these dance moms.

00:05:35.134 --> 00:05:37.136 line:95%,end
'Cause I'm not a doctor like Holly.
I'm from the hood.

00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:39.605 line:95%,end
Believe that.

00:05:40.773 --> 00:05:44.711 line:95%,end
Moms, I am begging you, no chaos.

00:05:44.777 --> 00:05:48.381 line:95%,end
I have been through the ringer and back

00:05:48.448 --> 00:05:50.783 line:95%,end
with this whole dog situation.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.554 line:95%,end
I want a simple, easy weekend, okey-doke?

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.689 line:95%,end
Alright, I'm going to dismiss you now.

00:05:56.756 --> 00:05:59.359 line:95%,end
Girls, spread apart,
and let's start our warm-up, please.

00:06:02.495 --> 00:06:03.963 line:5%,start
Think of grandeur.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.000 line:5%,start
Think of being in a ballroom
at a black tie event

00:06:08.067 --> 00:06:11.037 line:95%,end
with a beautiful, handsome man
in a tuxedo.

00:06:11.104 --> 00:06:13.039 line:95%,end
This is an epic love story.

00:06:13.106 --> 00:06:15.708 line:95%,end
It's about a peasant girl who is sick,

00:06:15.775 --> 00:06:19.212 line:95%,end
and she's afraid that
the illness is going to take her life,

00:06:19.278 --> 00:06:21.481 line:95%,end
and she'll be separated
from the man she loves.

00:06:25.718 --> 00:06:27.186 line:95%,end
I thought I was ready to be back.

00:06:27.253 --> 00:06:30.690 line:95%,end
I thought I was stronger than this,
but, obviously, I'm not.

00:06:30.757 --> 00:06:32.425 line:95%,end
I want to go home.

00:06:32.492 --> 00:06:36.429 line:95%,end
I want to be with my mom,
and I want to be sad.

00:06:39.198 --> 00:06:40.266 line:95%,end
I'm going to excuse myself.

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:45.438 line:95%,end
Work on that part, Maddie. Count it out.

00:06:45.505 --> 00:06:48.374 line:95%,end
Abby is taking this mourning
a little bit to the extreme.

00:06:48.441 --> 00:06:49.675 line:95%,end
This is a dog.

00:06:52.545 --> 00:06:54.080 line:95%,end
She just left us hanging.


00:06:54.147 --> 00:06:56.115 line:95%,end
Well, I'm sure she's very sad.

00:06:56.182 --> 00:06:59.485 line:95%,end
I know she is, Melissa,
but life still goes on.

00:06:59.552 --> 00:07:01.721 line:95%,end
Maybe the girls can make
a big card for her.

00:07:01.788 --> 00:07:04.290 line:95%,end
Maybe dedicate the dance to her.

00:07:04.357 --> 00:07:07.560 line:95%,end
We could dedicate it to Baby.
The girls would love that.

00:07:07.627 --> 00:07:11.330 line:5%,start
I know it sounds crazy to change
the group dance and pick a new song,

00:07:11.397 --> 00:07:13.566 line:95%,end
but Abby's very vulnerable right now.

00:07:13.633 --> 00:07:15.735 line:95%,end
And you rarely see that in her,

00:07:15.802 --> 00:07:18.838 line:95%,end
so I want her to know
that the moms are there for her.

00:07:18.905 --> 00:07:19.906 line:95%,end
Here, listen.

00:07:19.972 --> 00:07:22.341 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:07:23.409 --> 00:07:26.145 line:95%,end
It's kind of jazzy. We can do that.

00:07:26.212 --> 00:07:28.881 line:95%,end
Jill plays us a song on her phone
called "Beautiful Day,"

00:07:28.948 --> 00:07:30.216 line:95%,end
and I really do love it.

00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:32.285 line:95%,end
And I think it's a really good idea
for the moms

00:07:32.351 --> 00:07:35.688 line:95%,end
to express to Abby
how sorry we are for her loss.

00:07:35.755 --> 00:07:38.090 line:95%,end
I just don't think it's a good idea

00:07:38.157 --> 00:07:41.627 line:95%,end
changing Abby's routine or the music.

00:07:42.762 --> 00:07:45.498 line:95%,end
- Oh, I like it.
- I like it too.

00:07:45.565 --> 00:07:47.567 line:95%,end
Yeah, but I think that
we do what Abby said.

00:07:47.633 --> 00:07:50.036 line:95%,end
- We're going to get in a lot of trouble.
- We are going to get in a lot of trouble.

00:07:50.102 --> 00:07:52.071 line:95%,end
I don't know.
I think Abby will really appreciate it.

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:54.040 line:95%,end
When's the last time
Abby appreciated anything?

00:07:54.106 --> 00:07:57.777 line:95%,end
I can't imagine Abby being okay with us
changing her group dance direction,

00:07:57.844 --> 00:08:00.446 line:95%,end
but at the same time,
if she appreciates the tribute,

00:08:00.513 --> 00:08:02.982 line:95%,end
I don't want all the girls
to be involved except for Chloe.

00:08:03.049 --> 00:08:05.885 line:95%,end
So fingers crossed
that I don't get suspended again.

00:08:05.952 --> 00:08:08.287 line:95%,end
- Okay, so we've got how many options?
- JILL: Three.

00:08:08.354 --> 00:08:10.990 line:95%,end
I don't know
if this actually goes with that music.

00:08:11.057 --> 00:08:15.461 line:95%,end
We decided to go with a new song choice
for the dedication for Broadway Baby,

00:08:15.528 --> 00:08:18.364 line:95%,end
and with that means new costuming.

00:08:18.431 --> 00:08:20.233 line:95%,end
So we're going to have
to come up with that.

00:08:20.299 --> 00:08:21.300 line:95%,end
God help us all.

00:08:21.367 --> 00:08:23.336 line:95%,end
I don't know, is this what
we're supposed to be wearing?

00:08:23.402 --> 00:08:25.605 line:95%,end
- Who knows?
- It is now.

00:08:27.807 --> 00:08:32.178 line:5%,start
So you want to think
very Southern, very bluesy,

00:08:32.245 --> 00:08:34.046 line:95%,end
like that kind of a feel.

00:08:34.113 --> 00:08:36.682 line:95%,end
I still can't believe
you and Christi aren't talking.

00:08:37.617 --> 00:08:39.252 line:95%,end
I did nothing wrong.

00:08:39.318 --> 00:08:40.853 line:95%,end
But I was having a really bad week,

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:43.322 line:95%,end
and a real friend would have picked up
a phone and called me.

00:08:43.389 --> 00:08:45.358 line:95%,end
But if you can't answer my phone calls,
then [bleep] you.

00:08:45.424 --> 00:08:46.959 line:95%,end
[bleep] you.

00:08:47.026 --> 00:08:48.261 line:95%,end
How long has it been now?

00:08:48.327 --> 00:08:50.563 line:95%,end
You're like on the third week,
I think. Yeah.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:53.165 line:95%,end
Christi and Abby got into a huge fight
a couple weeks ago

00:08:53.232 --> 00:08:57.003 line:95%,end
over Chloe dropping her hat,
and then Christi got suspended.

00:08:57.069 --> 00:09:00.473 line:95%,end
And I tried reaching out to her,
and I haven't talked to her since.

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.709 line:95%,end
I thought our friendship meant
more than that.

00:09:03.776 --> 00:09:06.646 line:95%,end
I really hope that you are able
to talk about it this week.

00:09:06.712 --> 00:09:07.713 line:95%,end
Pisses me off.

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.348 line:95%,end
Things are already pretty chaotic.

00:09:09.415 --> 00:09:12.318 line:95%,end
The last thing we need
is Christi and Kelly fighting.

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:16.222 line:95%,end
[music continuing]

00:09:30.436 --> 00:09:32.905 line:95%,end
She was so cute and never hurt anybody.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.875 line:95%,end
She made everybody smile.

00:09:38.711 --> 00:09:41.847 line:95%,end
And what if something was wrong,
and I could have done something about it?

00:09:42.782 --> 00:09:45.351 line:95%,end
I think maybe it was her time to go.

00:09:46.552 --> 00:09:49.155 line:95%,end
I mean, she got sick in a day.

00:09:49.221 --> 00:09:51.457 line:95%,end
- It was that quick.
- I know.

00:09:51.524 --> 00:09:53.960 line:5%,start
She kept me sane.

00:09:54.026 --> 00:09:57.363 line:5%,start
She made everything okay.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:02.134 line:95%,end
When I would come home from work
upset or distraught over the mothers,

00:10:02.201 --> 00:10:05.271 line:95%,end
or you just have a rough day at work
and you come home,

00:10:05.338 --> 00:10:08.708 line:95%,end
and they kiss you, and they lick you,
and then you're just--

00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:14.513 line:95%,end
I wasn't here when she needed me.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.016 line:95%,end
I was with somebody else's kids.

[music playing]

00:10:26.592 --> 00:10:28.260 line:95%,end
Hm. Okay.

00:10:28.327 --> 00:10:30.363 line:95%,end
That's kind of strange.

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:32.698 line:95%,end
Okay, keep going.

00:10:32.765 --> 00:10:34.166 line:95%,end
I am worried that Abby's not here.

00:10:34.233 --> 00:10:38.204 line:5%,start
I mean, this is her studio,
and we need her here.

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:41.507 line:95%,end
God. She's a no-show again.

00:10:41.574 --> 00:10:45.811 line:5%,start
I understand Abby's still grieving,
but we need her right now.

00:10:45.878 --> 00:10:49.849 line:95%,end
We changed the group dance and song
to a tribute for Broadway Baby,

00:10:49.915 --> 00:10:52.818 line:95%,end
and on top of that,
Black Patsy is going to be there.

00:10:52.885 --> 00:10:55.821 line:95%,end
The last thing we need
right now is to lose.

00:10:55.888 --> 00:10:58.024 line:95%,end
Hello. It's so quiet out there.

00:10:58.090 --> 00:10:59.825 line:95%,end
- I know.
- You can hear a pin drop.

00:10:59.892 --> 00:11:01.861 line:95%,end
- Do dogs go to heaven?
- Yeah.

00:11:01.927 --> 00:11:04.196 line:95%,end
- Doggie heaven.
- Dogs totally going to heaven.

00:11:04.263 --> 00:11:07.867 line:95%,end
Abby's probably hoping she goes to hell
because that's where Abby is going to be.

00:11:07.933 --> 00:11:09.402 line:95%,end
[laughs]

00:11:14.674 --> 00:11:15.775 line:5%,start
What are you going to do?

00:11:15.841 --> 00:11:19.545 line:5%,start
Everywhere I look,
there's memories of Baby, everywhere.

00:11:20.179 --> 00:11:22.048 line:95%,end
And I don't know
if I want to leave you alone.

00:11:22.114 --> 00:11:24.016 line:95%,end
That scares me.

00:11:24.083 --> 00:11:27.653 line:5%,start
I think losing Baby so suddenly
was a wake-up call for me.

00:11:28.587 --> 00:11:30.756 line:5%,start
My mom is all I have left.

00:11:30.823 --> 00:11:34.493 line:95%,end
And if something happened to her
while I was on the road with these kids,

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.595 line:95%,end
I would never forgive myself.

00:11:36.662 --> 00:11:39.131 line:95%,end
Well, you have to go back
to the studio and teach the kids.

00:11:39.198 --> 00:11:40.900 line:95%,end
I mean, all those kids you have.

00:11:40.966 --> 00:11:43.836 line:95%,end
- I know, but they're so unappreciative.
- No, they're not.

00:11:43.903 --> 00:11:47.306 line:95%,end
Yes, they are. They roll their eyes,
and they're all bratty,

00:11:47.373 --> 00:11:49.075 line:95%,end
and my Baby never did that.

00:11:49.141 --> 00:11:53.412 line:95%,end
I don't know if I can go back to the team,
or back to the studio even.

00:11:59.685 --> 00:12:03.355 line:95%,end
- I'm very sorry--
- Oh, look how nice.

00:12:03.422 --> 00:12:05.958 line:95%,end
- I know you--
- That looks really good.

00:12:06.025 --> 00:12:08.494 line:5%,start
The girls made a card for Abby
all on their own,

00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:11.664 line:5%,start
and I think it was great that they wanted
to show her how much they care.

00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:15.367 line:95%,end
When I was in my private,
Miss Abby was telling me that

00:12:15.434 --> 00:12:17.803 line:95%,end
she was in such pain and stuff.

00:12:19.371 --> 00:12:21.707 line:95%,end
Like, she would carry her like a baby,

00:12:21.774 --> 00:12:23.542 line:5%,start
and Baby kept throwing her head back.

00:12:23.609 --> 00:12:25.945 line:5%,start
I've never seen Miss Abby so sad before,

00:12:26.011 --> 00:12:28.514 line:5%,start
and she's been crying every day.

00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:32.485 line:95%,end
So I think that this card
will hopefully cheer her up.

00:12:32.551 --> 00:12:34.453 line:95%,end

00:12:44.096 --> 00:12:45.531 line:95%,end
We have Niyala again?

00:12:46.298 --> 00:12:47.867 line:95%,end
Yeah, Abby's not here.

00:12:47.933 --> 00:12:52.838 line:95%,end
Obviously, she has taken
this mourning thing to extreme.

00:12:52.905 --> 00:12:54.540 line:95%,end
Does anybody want to come down with me

00:12:54.607 --> 00:12:57.176 line:95%,end
and find out Niyala knows
anything about Abby?

00:12:57.243 --> 00:12:59.278 line:95%,end
- No.
- Okay, we'll be back.

00:12:59.345 --> 00:13:00.746 line:95%,end
We'll let you know what we find out.

00:13:00.813 --> 00:13:02.915 line:95%,end
It's funny that Christi's still mad at me.

00:13:02.982 --> 00:13:04.517 line:95%,end
I mean, Abby's dog died.

00:13:04.583 --> 00:13:07.353 line:95%,end
We have no idea
if she's coming to the competition.

00:13:07.419 --> 00:13:10.222 line:95%,end
And she would rather be pouting
and be mad at me

00:13:10.289 --> 00:13:12.591 line:95%,end
than to go down and find out
what's going on.

00:13:15.127 --> 00:13:17.563 line:95%,end
Sorry to interrupt.

We try not to barge in or anything.

00:13:19.899 --> 00:13:22.835 line:95%,end
We were just wondering
if you've heard from Abby or anything?

00:13:23.602 --> 00:13:24.603 line:95%,end
Not at all?

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:26.839 line:95%,end
Do you know if she'll be back
before the competition?

00:13:27.973 --> 00:13:29.308 line:95%,end
No.

00:13:29.375 --> 00:13:30.676 line:95%,end

You know, sad, struggle.

people are intimidated

I really like Nia's solo this week.

00:14:58.998 --> 00:15:01.033 line:5%,start
The only thing is
she's dancing with a hat,

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:02.501 line:5%,start
and that always makes me nervous,

00:15:02.568 --> 00:15:05.537 line:95%,end
because if you drop a hat on stage,
Abby gets really upset.

00:15:05.604 --> 00:15:07.706 line:95%,end
Okay. You're going to put
that hat on your head.

00:15:07.773 --> 00:15:09.708 line:95%,end
You got to put it on your head
so it doesn't fall off.

00:15:09.775 --> 00:15:11.744 line:95%,end
I hope Nia doesn't wear that hat

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:14.847 line:95%,end

over that hat.

00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:16.015 line:95%,end
I don't want to lose another one.

Kelly, you didn't lose
a friendship over a hat.

00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:19.985 line:95%,end
You lost a friendship because
you told me to go [bleep] myself.

00:15:20.819 --> 00:15:22.288 line:95%,end
You admitted I called you the one time.

00:15:22.354 --> 00:15:24.657 line:95%,end

- Okay, well, why didn't you call me back?

00:15:24.723 --> 00:15:26.926 line:95%,end
- Why didn't you call me back?
- Because you were on the bus with Abby.

00:15:26.992 --> 00:15:29.995 line:95%,end
- So what if I'm on the bus with Abby?
- I was the one having a bad week.

When you have a bad week, my God,

to get you back on the team? Me.

00:15:40.773 --> 00:15:42.775 line:95%,end
I know that. That's why
I was your biggest advocate

Kelly was my best friend,

trying to get her kid ahead

by having Maddie's solo
be dedicated to Broadway Baby,

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:22.901 line:95%,end

- I talked to Abby.

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:26.738 line:95%,end
I showed her that video.

00:28:28.306 --> 00:28:29.641 line:95%,end
We had a question for you.

00:28:31.643 --> 00:28:34.746 line:95%,end
Why did you go and have Maddie's dance

00:28:34.813 --> 00:28:38.316 line:95%,end
dedicated to Baby and Abby
when we wanted to do it as a group?

00:28:38.383 --> 00:28:42.087 line:95%,end
After Abby specifically said,
I don't want it. I don't--

00:28:42.153 --> 00:28:45.156 line:95%,end
Like we wanted to do it as a group
to be from all the kids

00:28:45.223 --> 00:28:48.193 line:95%,end
and then you went and did it
for just Maddie.

00:28:48.259 --> 00:28:52.597 line:95%,end
I don't know. I just thought that
I should do something special for her

00:28:52.664 --> 00:28:54.566 line:95%,end
because I was really close with the dog.

00:28:54.632 --> 00:28:56.634 line:95%,end
I mean, I babysat her quite a few times.

00:28:56.701 --> 00:28:59.104 line:95%,end
I feel like you just take our information

00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:01.539 line:95%,end
and use it to your advantage to
get more on Abby's good side.

00:29:01.606 --> 00:29:03.975 line:95%,end
You knew that we had a tribute dance plan,

00:29:04.042 --> 00:29:06.478 line:95%,end
and you went and you did
a tribute dance for Maddie.

00:29:07.345 --> 00:29:09.714 line:95%,end
It's not fair that
Melissa somehow always manages

00:29:09.781 --> 00:29:11.483 line:95%,end
to look better than the rest of us,

00:29:11.549 --> 00:29:14.719 line:95%,end
and Chloe and all the other girls
are the ones who end up paying the price,

00:29:14.786 --> 00:29:16.454 line:95%,end
because of things just like this.

00:29:16.521 --> 00:29:18.490 line:95%,end
We just want you to own up to it, Melissa.

00:29:20.024 --> 00:29:21.626 line:95%,end
I don't think this is about the tribute.

00:29:21.693 --> 00:29:23.962 line:5%,start
The moms are just mad that
Abby and I are friends again

00:29:24.028 --> 00:29:28.533 line:95%,end
and they just want Abby to treat me
like she treats them.

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:31.069 line:95%,end
You always try to say like,
oh, I'm so nice,

00:29:31.136 --> 00:29:32.637 line:95%,end
and I'm so sweet. I just love everybody.

00:29:32.704 --> 00:29:35.573 line:95%,end
But I think that you would
like kill us in our sleep

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:36.875 line:95%,end
if it meant your kids would get ahead.

There's a lot of tension in the air,

00:29:45.083 --> 00:29:48.186 line:5%,start

is the group dance that's coming up.

to tribute Maddie's dance
to Broadway Baby,

00:30:15.914 --> 00:30:18.550 line:95%,end
and none of the other girls
were allowed to.

00:30:18.616 --> 00:30:19.617 line:95%,end
I don't get it.

00:30:19.684 --> 00:30:21.519 line:95%,end
So is this going to be a tribute dance?

00:30:21.586 --> 00:30:24.122 line:95%,end
- Because I misunderstood.
- No.

00:30:24.189 --> 00:30:26.191 line:95%,end
We all wanted to do the tribute.

00:30:26.257 --> 00:30:30.695 line:95%,end
She ended up being the only one
to tribute her child's dance.

00:30:30.762 --> 00:30:32.997 line:95%,end
She was close to my dog.

00:30:33.064 --> 00:30:35.266 line:95%,end
But I still can feel sorry for you.

00:30:35.333 --> 00:30:37.735 line:95%,end
I wish the moms
just wouldn't fight with Abby

00:30:37.802 --> 00:30:39.370 line:95%,end

to do to lift her spirits,

00:30:44.242 --> 00:30:47.478 line:95%,end
You watched my dog one day
at the dance studio.

00:30:47.545 --> 00:30:48.613 line:95%,end
That's right. This wasn't about that.

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:50.615 line:95%,end
My dog has been at Melissa's house
and stayed there.

00:30:50.682 --> 00:30:52.817 line:95%,end
She's watched it when I traveled
and I've gone away.

00:30:52.884 --> 00:30:54.953 line:95%,end
So you're saying it's okay for Melissa--


00:30:55.019 --> 00:30:56.554 line:95%,end
Basically, she lies.

00:30:56.621 --> 00:31:00.024 line:95%,end
I just can't get over the nerve of Jill
and the rest of the moms.

00:31:00.091 --> 00:31:02.460 line:5%,start
We have a group dance to worry about.

00:31:02.527 --> 00:31:06.931 line:5%,start
Maybe the moms should concentrate on that
instead of going after Melissa.

00:31:06.998 --> 00:31:10.134 line:95%,end

or you will not be in the routine.

Who else is in the yellow top?

Does anyone have plain pink shorts?

I felt really rushed.

00:31:19.744 --> 00:31:22.413 line:95%,end
I mean, Abby scratched the dance
the girls had prepared,

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:24.415 line:95%,end
and now they're forced
to do something last minute.

00:31:24.482 --> 00:31:27.485 line:95%,end
I don't like to do things last minute.
I like to be prepared.

00:31:27.552 --> 00:31:31.422 line:95%,end
This is a feel-good, pretty number
to show off your beautiful technique,

00:31:31.489 --> 00:31:34.492 line:95%,end
so don't go out and do the same bad arms

00:32:13.798 --> 00:32:15.833 line:95%,end
Na-na na-na ay.

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:18.069 line:95%,end
Na-na na-na ay ay.

00:32:18.136 --> 00:32:20.338 line:95%,end
Na-na na-na ay.

00:32:20.405 --> 00:32:22.840 line:95%,end
Na-na na-na ay ay.

00:32:22.907 --> 00:32:25.243 line:95%,end
Na-na na-na ay.

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:26.811 line:95%,end
Na-na na-na ay ay.

00:32:26.878 --> 00:32:28.746 line:95%,end
That was a good leap for Paige.

00:32:28.813 --> 00:32:33.351 line:95%,end
(SINGING) Hey you, look up at the sun
'cause it's shining for you.

00:32:33.418 --> 00:32:35.553 line:95%,end
It's a beautiful day.

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:38.389 line:95%,end
It's a beautiful day.

00:32:38.456 --> 00:32:42.560 line:95%,end
See a million colors
and you'll feel brand-new.

00:32:42.627 --> 00:32:44.562 line:95%,end
It's a beautiful day.

00:32:44.629 --> 00:32:47.532 line:95%,end
It's a beautiful day.

00:32:47.598 --> 00:32:49.934 line:95%,end
Na-na Na-na ay.

00:32:50.001 --> 00:32:52.503 line:95%,end
Na-na na-na ay ay.

00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:54.672 line:5%,start
Na-na na-na ay.

00:32:54.739 --> 00:32:57.075 line:5%,start
Na-na na-na ay ay.

00:32:57.141 --> 00:32:58.142 line:95%,end
Yeah.

00:32:59.677 --> 00:33:02.447 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:33:02.513 --> 00:33:03.715 line:95%,end
It wasn't the best.

00:33:03.781 --> 00:33:06.851 line:95%,end
I think some of the girls
could have made better choices,

00:33:06.918 --> 00:33:08.753 line:95%,end
but the technique looked good.

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:10.254 line:95%,end
We'll see what the judges say.

00:33:13.791 --> 00:33:14.792 line:95%,end
- ABBY LEE MILLER: Nia?
- BLACK PATSY: Yeah.

00:33:14.859 --> 00:33:15.860 line:95%,end
- ABBY LEE MILLER: No.
- BLACK PATSY: She was.

00:33:15.927 --> 00:33:18.062 line:95%,end
- ABBY LEE MILLER: Never noticed.
- I think you were wrong about that.

00:33:18.129 --> 00:33:19.464 line:95%,end
- I don't think so.
- I don't think so.

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:22.066 line:95%,end
BLACK PATSY: She has two left legs.
I knew she was a leftie.

00:33:22.133 --> 00:33:23.768 line:95%,end
I'm not engaging.

00:33:23.835 --> 00:33:25.737 line:95%,end
Well why did you say
something to begin with?

00:33:25.803 --> 00:33:28.106 line:95%,end
- I'm disengaging.
- Hm.

00:33:28.172 --> 00:33:31.743 line:95%,end
For her to sit in the audience
and critique somebody else's child

00:33:31.809 --> 00:33:34.012 line:95%,end
is just plain wrong.

00:33:34.078 --> 00:33:35.146 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: That's very rude.

00:33:35.213 --> 00:33:37.048 line:95%,end
So there can be
two rude people here today.

00:33:37.115 --> 00:33:38.750 line:95%,end
There's enough rudeness for everybody.

00:33:38.816 --> 00:33:39.984 line:95%,end
If you're going to critique something,

00:33:40.051 --> 00:33:41.386 line:95%,end
you would have known--
- I'm going.

00:33:41.452 --> 00:33:43.621 line:95%,end
--that she was just a whole
beat ahead of everybody.

00:33:43.688 --> 00:33:45.957 line:95%,end
You didn't let Patsy
run you out of here, did you?

00:33:46.024 --> 00:33:48.626 line:95%,end
If she thinks that she ran me
out of that auditorium,

00:33:48.693 --> 00:33:50.128 line:95%,end
she better think again.

00:33:50.194 --> 00:33:52.163 line:95%,end
I gracefully exited.

00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:54.866 line:95%,end
It's easy for her to dish it out
and go off on everybody,

00:33:54.932 --> 00:33:57.235 line:5%,start
but when somebody tell her something,
she don't want to hear it.

00:33:57.301 --> 00:33:58.770 line:5%,start
That's a punk move right there.

00:33:58.836 --> 00:34:01.406 line:95%,end
And I see Kendall, 'cause that was
my first time really watching her,

00:34:01.472 --> 00:34:03.674 line:95%,end
and she can't dance, either. Kendall, no.

00:34:03.741 --> 00:34:05.476 line:95%,end
[laughs]

00:34:05.543 --> 00:34:09.280 line:95%,end
All of a sudden,
Black Patsy moves on from Nia to Kendall

00:34:09.347 --> 00:34:10.715 line:95%,end
and starts trash-talking her.

00:34:11.649 --> 00:34:13.684 line:95%,end
Did you hear that?
She just said Kendall can't dance.

00:34:13.751 --> 00:34:14.752 line:95%,end
Who said that?

00:34:14.819 --> 00:34:17.755 line:95%,end
It's obvious that
Black Patsy is just jealous of Kendall

00:34:17.822 --> 00:34:20.458 line:95%,end
because she replaced Nicaya
on Abby's team.

00:34:20.525 --> 00:34:22.326 line:95%,end
That little girl cannot dance.

00:34:22.393 --> 00:34:23.661 line:95%,end
Your daughter cannot dance.

00:34:23.728 --> 00:34:26.230 line:95%,end
I thought Nia was the one
that had to work her way up.

00:34:26.297 --> 00:34:28.132 line:95%,end
Nia dances circles around your kid.

00:34:28.199 --> 00:34:29.467 line:95%,end
Well, you know what's funny?

00:34:29.534 --> 00:34:32.036 line:95%,end
We said the same thing
about your little girl.

00:34:32.103 --> 00:34:35.273 line:95%,end
Bitch, you don't want to go there with me.
I will show your ass hood.


00:34:38.342 --> 00:34:39.877 line:95%,end
That little girl cannot dance.

00:34:39.944 --> 00:34:41.345 line:95%,end
Your daughter cannot dance.

00:34:41.412 --> 00:34:43.881 line:95%,end
I thought Nia was the one
that had to work her way up.

00:34:43.948 --> 00:34:45.817 line:95%,end
Nia dances circles around your kid.

00:34:45.883 --> 00:34:47.185 line:95%,end
You know what's funny?

00:34:47.251 --> 00:34:49.554 line:95%,end
We said the same thing
about your little girl.

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:53.991 line:5%,start
I'm not going to sit back
and let this woman bad-mouth my child

00:34:54.058 --> 00:34:56.594 line:95%,end
and say all this [bleep] that isn't true.

00:34:56.661 --> 00:34:59.030 line:95%,end
I walked in your recital,
got right on stage,

00:34:59.097 --> 00:35:00.264 line:95%,end
and danced with your "elite" dancers.

00:35:00.331 --> 00:35:02.533 line:95%,end
You were kicked out
because she wasn't good enough.

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:04.035 line:95%,end
No, bitch, I left.

00:35:04.102 --> 00:35:05.703 line:95%,end
You ran back to that studio

00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:08.673 line:95%,end
and I see why they didn't want you back,
because your kid sucks.

00:35:08.739 --> 00:35:10.108 line:95%,end
Does that make you feel good?

00:35:10.174 --> 00:35:13.077 line:95%,end
Bitch, you don't want to go there with me.
I will show your ass hood.

00:35:13.144 --> 00:35:15.279 line:95%,end
- Who started this?
- You don't want to--

00:35:15.346 --> 00:35:17.148 line:95%,end
Who started this?

00:35:17.215 --> 00:35:21.519 line:5%,start
I just thought it was hysterical to see
Jill trying to get like all hood rat.

00:35:21.586 --> 00:35:25.256 line:95%,end
Shut your big mouth
and I'll tell you who started it.

00:35:25.323 --> 00:35:27.358 line:95%,end
Shut the blank up.

00:35:27.425 --> 00:35:30.528 line:95%,end
And Black Patsy's all like, F y'all.
I'm like, whoa, whoa.

00:35:30.595 --> 00:35:32.563 line:95%,end
Okay, stop. stop. Stop.

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:35.333 line:95%,end
[arguing]

00:35:35.399 --> 00:35:37.135 line:95%,end
Stop.

00:35:37.201 --> 00:35:41.105 line:95%,end
I apologize on behalf
of the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:35:41.172 --> 00:35:43.341 line:95%,end
You're a punk, Abby. Apologize for that.

00:35:44.041 --> 00:35:45.209 line:95%,end
Where is my daughter?

00:35:45.276 --> 00:35:46.677 line:95%,end
We are not a part of that,

00:35:46.744 --> 00:35:49.881 line:95%,end
and I am very, very sorry
that this happened

00:35:49.947 --> 00:35:51.215 line:95%,end
and the children had to hear that.

00:35:51.282 --> 00:35:53.017 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:35:53.084 --> 00:35:55.753 line:95%,end
I'm done talking.
I'm disengaging, like Dr. Holly said.

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:57.889 line:95%,end
- [bleep] y'all.
- [gasps]

00:35:57.955 --> 00:36:03.261 line:95%,end
I really hope to never, ever, ever
come across that woman again.

00:36:03.327 --> 00:36:05.096 line:95%,end
Bitch is what she is.

00:36:05.163 --> 00:36:06.631 line:95%,end
Where were you guys?

00:36:06.697 --> 00:36:07.932 line:95%,end
Come on.

00:36:07.999 --> 00:36:10.434 line:95%,end
I really wish you guys
could have stuck up for me.

00:36:10.501 --> 00:36:12.303 line:95%,end
Jill was all mad that
the moms wouldn't jump in,

00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:15.373 line:95%,end
but I was really worried that Black Patsy
was going to pull up my weave.

00:36:15.439 --> 00:36:16.440 line:95%,end
I-- I--

00:36:17.241 --> 00:36:19.243 line:95%,end
She's speechless. This one's speechless.

00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:21.212 line:95%,end
You know, Kelly,
I was actually looking at you

00:36:21.279 --> 00:36:23.381 line:95%,end
and I'm going, come on. Come on.

00:36:23.447 --> 00:36:25.483 line:95%,end
But I couldn't fight because I didn't--

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:28.019 line:95%,end
I was trying to get you
because I wasn't letting her go down.

00:36:28.085 --> 00:36:29.954 line:95%,end
I'm like, come on.
You're not doing anything, and I'm like--

00:36:30.021 --> 00:36:31.956 line:95%,end
Maybe that's my way to join in.

00:36:32.023 --> 00:36:34.592 line:95%,end
We are partners in crime.

00:36:34.659 --> 00:36:37.094 line:95%,end
Oh my god, Kelly, I need you.

00:36:37.161 --> 00:36:38.729 line:95%,end
I miss so many things with Kelly.

00:36:38.796 --> 00:36:40.731 line:95%,end
I just miss knowing that
someone has my back.

00:36:40.798 --> 00:36:42.934 line:95%,end
And, clearly, you know,
Kelly and I need each other,

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.404 line:95%,end
because when we're separated,
we don't have the forces to fight evil.

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:49.273 line:95%,end
But I need you to be my friend
because we can fight evil forces.

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:52.109 line:95%,end
Like I lost my mojo. I've got nothing.

00:36:52.176 --> 00:36:54.779 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:36:54.845 --> 00:36:57.315 line:95%,end
First of all, we're going to start
the awards in just a second.

00:36:57.381 --> 00:37:01.519 line:95%,end
But I want to address something
that happened here just briefly.

00:37:01.586 --> 00:37:06.958 line:95%,end
For those of you that were out
in the hallway during the incident,

00:37:07.024 --> 00:37:11.929 line:95%,end
I want to sincerely apologize
from Expressions Dance and myself.

00:37:11.996 --> 00:37:14.799 line:95%,end
These ladies are a bunch of rich bitches.
That's what they are.

00:37:15.666 --> 00:37:18.736 line:95%,end
ANNOUNCER: That type
of behavior is not tolerated.

00:37:18.803 --> 00:37:21.172 line:95%,end
That person was removed
from the competition.

00:37:21.239 --> 00:37:23.674 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:37:23.741 --> 00:37:24.909 line:95%,end
Thank you very much.

00:37:25.943 --> 00:37:28.546 line:95%,end
If I do come back,
these moms better watch out.

00:37:29.914 --> 00:37:33.017 line:5%,start
It's a shame that
Patsy couldn't control her temper

00:37:33.084 --> 00:37:34.185 line:5%,start
and now she's gone.

00:37:34.252 --> 00:37:37.054 line:95%,end
Nicaya doesn't even get to see the awards.

00:37:37.121 --> 00:37:38.356 line:95%,end
It's a tight competition.

00:37:38.422 --> 00:37:41.759 line:95%,end
She could have placed,
but now she'll never know.

00:37:41.826 --> 00:37:43.294 line:95%,end
Now, on to the fun stuff.

00:37:44.328 --> 00:37:46.163 line:5%,start
Alright, ladies and gentlemen,
we are going to start

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:48.499 line:5%,start
with our judges awards first.

00:37:49.367 --> 00:37:51.535 line:95%,end
Judges award for fiercest costume.

00:37:51.602 --> 00:37:55.273 line:95%,end
Lots of costumes stood out to me today,
but what I loved about this costume

00:37:55.339 --> 00:37:57.575 line:95%,end
was the way the dancer worked it
with such confidence.

00:37:57.642 --> 00:37:59.410 line:95%,end
Congratulations, number 25.


00:37:59.477 --> 00:38:01.646 line:5%,start
- [cheering]
- Nia.

00:38:03.614 --> 00:38:05.549 line:95%,end
And who made your costume?

00:38:05.616 --> 00:38:07.652 line:95%,end
Well, my mom made my costume.

00:38:07.718 --> 00:38:08.753 line:95%,end
Congratulations.

00:38:09.553 --> 00:38:11.355 line:5%,start
Take that, Abby.

00:38:11.422 --> 00:38:13.658 line:95%,end
ANNOUNCER: We have our top soloists.

00:38:13.724 --> 00:38:18.829 line:95%,end
In third place,

00:38:20.097 --> 00:38:21.399 line:95%,end
entry number 25.

00:38:21.465 --> 00:38:24.468 line:95%,end
[cheering]

00:38:26.304 --> 00:38:27.438 line:95%,end
Nia got third.

00:38:27.505 --> 00:38:29.907 line:5%,start
HOLLY: I am unbelievably proud
of Nia this week.

00:38:29.974 --> 00:38:31.909 line:5%,start
She scored third overall.

00:38:31.976 --> 00:38:35.279 line:95%,end
And it was a chaotic week,
filled with emotion, pressure from Patsy,

00:38:35.346 --> 00:38:38.949 line:95%,end
but Nia held her head up high,
and she scored big for Abby.

00:38:40.851 --> 00:38:46.691 line:95%,end
And in first place,
with a score to 294.5 points,

00:38:47.325 --> 00:38:50.428 line:95%,end
entry number 26, "Showing You My Heart."

00:38:50.494 --> 00:38:53.497 line:5%,start
[applause]

00:38:55.866 --> 00:38:59.470 line:95%,end
Maddie is a champion,
and the judges recognize that.

00:38:59.537 --> 00:39:03.274 line:95%,end
I am so proud of her,
and I know that Baby would be too.

00:39:03.341 --> 00:39:06.610 line:5%,start
ANNOUNCER: Okay, now we'll be moving
into our small groups.

00:39:06.677 --> 00:39:09.547 line:95%,end
Considering the group awards,
I can't say I have high hopes

00:39:09.613 --> 00:39:11.649 line:95%,end
that this group dance
is going to do anything.

00:39:11.716 --> 00:39:14.685 line:95%,end
We're doing our top two scores
in the junior division.

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:19.523 line:95%,end
Second place,
with a score of 266.95 points,

00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:22.760 line:95%,end
entry number 65, "Somebody to Love."

00:39:22.827 --> 00:39:23.928 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:39:23.994 --> 00:39:26.464 line:95%,end
They just announced second place,
and it wasn't us.

00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:29.567 line:95%,end

She made everybody smile, right?

00:40:32.263 --> 00:40:33.931 line:95%,end
If you love Baby and care about her,

00:40:33.998 --> 00:40:37.201 line:95%,end
then say a prayer that she's okay

I didn't do anything behind your back.

00:41:03.928 --> 00:41:06.964 line:5%,start
I did it right in front of you,
and I did it to benefit my child.

00:41:07.031 --> 00:41:08.732 line:5%,start
I don't feel like we're being a team.
