they gave Chloe a 99.10.

a 27.5 in a category
that only had 25 points.

00:18:17.463 --> 00:18:19.098 line:95%,end
- I know! Who thinks that way?
- I don't know. That was crazy.

00:18:19.631 --> 00:18:21.266 line:95%,end
And you know what? If that's the
way she feels, then, you know,

00:18:21.366 --> 00:18:22.835 line:95%,end
I don't be your friend.

00:18:23.302 --> 00:18:26.805 line:95%,end
We all discussed this as a group

00:18:26.872 --> 00:18:30.843 line:95%,end
and decided as a team
we were not sending our kids to
this.

00:18:30.909 --> 00:18:33.979 line:95%,end
I just think that this proves
that we can't trust Melissa.

00:18:34.046 --> 00:18:36.582 line:95%,end
Melissa sat there and told
all of us-- she promised.

00:18:36.648 --> 00:18:38.016 line:95%,end
Like, what does
that make you think?

00:18:38.083 --> 00:18:39.585 line:95%,end
Because that makes me think
that she doesn't really

00:18:39.651 --> 00:18:40.886 line:95%,end
value our friendship?

00:18:40.953 --> 00:18:42.688 line:95%,end
She's definitely made
it out that dance

00:18:42.754 --> 00:18:44.223 line:95%,end
is more important than school.

00:18:44.289 --> 00:18:46.558 line:95%,end
If the only thing that's
important to you in life

00:18:46.625 --> 00:18:49.528 line:95%,end
is getting your kids ahead
of other people in dance,

00:18:49.595 --> 00:18:54.533 line:95%,end
don't sit upstairs and pretend
you don't care if your kids win
or lose.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.502 line:95%,end
Own who you are.

00:18:56.568 --> 00:18:58.370 line:95%,end
Stop lying to our faces.

00:18:58.437 --> 00:19:00.606 line:95%,end
Maddie had an hour with Abby.

00:19:00.672 --> 00:19:02.374 line:95%,end
Mackenzie had two
hours with Abby.

00:19:02.441 --> 00:19:03.909 line:95%,end
And Chloe got none?

00:19:03.976 --> 00:19:06.645 line:95%,end
If you can't see that's wrong,
then you are really blind.

00:19:06.712 --> 00:19:07.913 line:95%,end
Then you have a problem.

00:19:08.914 --> 00:19:13.051 line:95%,end
The fundamental issue is your
word-- you know, friendship.

00:19:13.118 --> 00:19:14.286 line:95%,end
What is it worth?

00:19:14.586 --> 00:19:18.457 line:95%,end
And what it's taught me
is that I can't trust everybody

00:19:18.524 --> 00:19:19.858 line:95%,end
when they give their word.


00:19:21.426 --> 00:19:23.862 line:95%,end
In this season, there was
quite a moment with Kelly.

00:19:24.696 --> 00:19:27.499 line:95%,end
Now, it's hard enough for me
to keep the kids focused,

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:29.568 line:95%,end
but the moms--

00:19:29.668 --> 00:19:30.836 line:95%,end
they're even tougher.

00:19:31.003 --> 00:19:33.972 line:5%,start
I said, you were clearly
upset with Abby--

00:19:34.039 --> 00:19:35.941 line:95%,end
you didn't want to take it out
on her, so you took on
[inaudible].

00:19:36.008 --> 00:19:37.876 line:95%,end
I was not upset with Abby.

00:19:37.943 --> 00:19:40.012 line:95%,end
Kelly, you were upset
about something.

00:19:40.078 --> 00:19:41.613 line:95%,end
But why were you
screaming at me?

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.650 line:95%,end
If anyone, Christi
should understand

00:19:44.716 --> 00:19:46.585 line:95%,end
why I wouldn't want
to start a fight with Abby.

00:19:46.652 --> 00:19:49.188 line:95%,end
Why Christi doesn't have
my back is beyond me.

00:19:49.254 --> 00:19:52.057 line:95%,end
You didn't stand up
for yourself with Abby.

00:19:52.124 --> 00:19:53.825 line:95%,end
That's not the Kelly I know.

00:19:54.426 --> 00:19:55.727 line:95%,end
KELLY HYLAND: Hmm,
maybe it's the new Kelly

00:19:55.794 --> 00:19:56.795 line:95%,end
- that you don't know.
- I know.

00:19:56.862 --> 00:19:59.665 line:95%,end
You know, you said yourself
that you don't even think of me

00:19:59.731 --> 00:20:00.832 line:95%,end
as a friend anymore--
that I'm a horrible friend.

00:20:00.899 --> 00:20:01.967 line:95%,end
I never said that.

00:20:02.034 --> 00:20:03.802 line:95%,end
You're full of [bleep] [bleep],,
Kelly, and you know it!

00:20:03.869 --> 00:20:05.737 line:95%,end
Oh, oh.
Well, maybe you should get
[bleep]!!

00:20:06.338 --> 00:20:07.773 line:5%,start
What did she just say?

00:20:09.575 --> 00:20:10.642 line:95%,end
Who just said that?

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:13.212 line:95%,end
I think what's
happening here, Kelly--

00:20:13.278 --> 00:20:16.048 line:95%,end
instead of your aggression
towards Abby, which is--

00:20:16.114 --> 00:20:17.549 line:95%,end
You're taking it
out on all of us!

00:20:17.616 --> 00:20:19.117 line:95%,end
I don't even want to hear
it, Kristi, 'cause remember?

00:20:19.184 --> 00:20:20.519 line:95%,end
- I'm a bad friend.
- You know what, you are!

00:20:20.586 --> 00:20:21.820 line:95%,end
When I sat here the entire week

00:20:21.887 --> 00:20:23.488 line:95%,end
you were gone and
stuck up for you.

00:20:23.555 --> 00:20:24.556 line:95%,end
- Whatever. Kiss my ass.
- You know what?

00:20:24.623 --> 00:20:26.959 line:95%,end
You didn't call me, because
you were pissed off about
something else.

00:20:27.025 --> 00:20:28.126 line:95%,end
Getting there.

00:20:28.193 --> 00:20:29.761 line:95%,end
That shows me that you're
really not a good friend.

00:20:29.828 --> 00:20:31.296 line:95%,end
- KELLY HYLAND: Believe me,
Christi. - I know! I know!

00:20:31.363 --> 00:20:33.599 line:95%,end
- I won't be your friend-- ever.
- Because I kiss everyone's
ass--

00:20:33.665 --> 00:20:34.833 line:95%,end
- You do!
- CHRISTI LUKASIAK: --to get my
kid ahead.

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.201 line:95%,end
- You do!
- No, I don't!

00:20:36.268 --> 00:20:37.302 line:95%,end
- KELLY HYLAND: You do.
- [bleep] you, Kelly!

00:20:37.369 --> 00:20:38.470 line:95%,end
- KELLY HYLAND: Ask Abby!
- [bleep] you!

00:20:39.004 --> 00:20:41.306 line:95%,end
Kelly's not the only
one that can lose it.

00:20:41.673 --> 00:20:46.278 line:95%,end
Jill-- she had her moment, too,
and I warned her to steer clear

00:20:46.345 --> 00:20:47.679 line:95%,end
of that dance mom.

00:20:49.681 --> 00:20:51.617 line:5%,start
- Hello!
- Hi!

00:20:51.683 --> 00:20:54.419 line:95%,end
CATHY NESBITT-STEIN: Ew!
We have unwelcome guests.

00:20:55.087 --> 00:20:57.656 line:95%,end
WOMAN: So what is going on here?

00:20:58.423 --> 00:21:00.158 line:95%,end
I see you got some
new team members.

00:21:00.225 --> 00:21:02.160 line:95%,end
- MAN: Well, welcome, ladies.
- Well, aren't you just a nosy
one?

00:21:02.227 --> 00:21:04.363 line:95%,end
Yes, I am!

00:21:04.429 --> 00:21:07.065 line:5%,start
Abby Lee Miller's
got her spies out.

00:21:07.132 --> 00:21:08.500 line:5%,start
I'm loving it.

00:21:08.567 --> 00:21:11.270 line:5%,start
I feel like they're
starting to squirm.

00:21:12.304 --> 00:21:14.306 line:95%,end
I know from experience
this is a waste of your time.

00:21:14.373 --> 00:21:15.741 line:95%,end
- Oh my God!
- Oh my God!

00:21:16.041 --> 00:21:19.678 line:95%,end
I didn't even recognize her!

00:21:19.745 --> 00:21:21.346 line:95%,end
They let her back in!

00:21:21.413 --> 00:21:23.248 line:95%,end
She got Kicked out of
the last competition.

00:21:23.315 --> 00:21:24.416 line:95%,end
No, we walked away from it.

00:21:24.483 --> 00:21:25.651 line:95%,end
We walked away from
the competition.

00:21:25.751 --> 00:21:26.918 line:95%,end
No, no, they escorted
you out. We saw it.

00:21:26.985 --> 00:21:29.388 line:95%,end
They told us the police
are here just in case

00:21:29.454 --> 00:21:30.689 line:5%,start
you have a little issue.

00:21:30.756 --> 00:21:33.825 line:5%,start
We walk into the dressing room,
and there's Black Patsy,

00:21:33.892 --> 00:21:36.328 line:5%,start
and she has this new look.

00:21:36.395 --> 00:21:38.730 line:95%,end
And she looks
exactly like Holly--

00:21:38.797 --> 00:21:42.401 line:95%,end
has Holly's hairdo,
is dressed like Holly.

00:21:42.467 --> 00:21:45.070 line:95%,end
And I'm thinking to myself,
are you trying to be Holly?

00:21:45.137 --> 00:21:48.607 line:95%,end
Because you'll never be
like Holly, Black Patsy.

00:21:48.674 --> 00:21:51.176 line:95%,end
No matter how hard you try,
you'll just never

00:21:51.243 --> 00:21:52.377 line:95%,end
be like Dr. Holly.

00:21:52.944 --> 00:21:54.980 line:95%,end
Hey, who was the one
who started hurling insults

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.281 line:95%,end
at the children? You.

00:21:56.348 --> 00:21:57.783 line:95%,end
I hurled insults at
Abby, and she didn't

00:21:57.849 --> 00:21:58.917 line:95%,end
- want to hear want to hear
that. - JILL VERTES: [inaudible]

00:21:58.984 --> 00:22:00.285 line:95%,end
That's what you do.

00:22:00.352 --> 00:22:01.420 line:95%,end
Why are you loud?

00:22:01.486 --> 00:22:02.587 line:95%,end
Have you not learned
anything yet?

00:22:02.654 --> 00:22:03.655 line:95%,end
Let's go.

00:22:03.722 --> 00:22:04.823 line:95%,end
'Cause there are no police
in here to protect you.

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:07.092 line:95%,end
- No, I'm not talking to you,
Kathy. - CATHY NESBITT-STEIN: It
doesn't matter.

00:22:07.159 --> 00:22:09.194 line:95%,end
- Yes, it does!
- Yes, it does!

00:22:09.294 --> 00:22:11.163 line:95%,end
The sign on the door
says Candy Apples--

00:22:11.229 --> 00:22:13.231 line:95%,end
Didn't say do not enter.

00:22:13.298 --> 00:22:15.634 line:95%,end
--says Candy Apple,
so why are you here?

00:22:15.701 --> 00:22:17.502 line:95%,end
- It didn't say ALDC.
- JILL VERTES: Why are you here?

00:22:17.569 --> 00:22:19.838 line:95%,end
- Because I was invited here.
- JILL VERTES: Abby's sloppy
seconds.

00:22:19.905 --> 00:22:22.007 line:95%,end
Cathy gets Abby's
sloppy seconds.

00:22:22.107 --> 00:22:23.542 line:95%,end
Studio-hopper, did
you just say that?

00:22:23.608 --> 00:22:25.010 line:95%,end
JILL VERTES: Come on,
let's get out of here.

00:22:26.111 --> 00:22:27.312 line:95%,end
Have fun!

00:22:27.379 --> 00:22:28.880 line:95%,end
Good luck with your new team.

00:22:30.515 --> 00:22:31.616 line:95%,end
They are a mess.

00:22:31.683 --> 00:22:33.418 line:95%,end
Put your mouth on vacation.

00:22:36.154 --> 00:22:37.856 line:95%,end
- Shut up.
- Who says shut up?

00:22:37.923 --> 00:22:39.057 line:95%,end
How old are you?

00:22:39.124 --> 00:22:41.526 line:95%,end
You said my daughter
sucked, remember?

00:22:41.593 --> 00:22:43.362 line:95%,end
That little girl cannot dance.

00:22:43.428 --> 00:22:44.763 line:95%,end
Your daughter cannot dance.

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:46.131 line:95%,end
Well, you know what's funny?

00:22:46.198 --> 00:22:48.533 line:95%,end
We said the same thing
about your little girl.

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.570 line:95%,end
You told my daughter she sucked.

00:22:53.171 --> 00:22:54.339 line:95%,end
Get off of me.

00:22:55.907 --> 00:22:57.809 line:95%,end
JILL VERTES: She pushed my face.

00:23:01.012 --> 00:23:03.415 line:95%,end
You touched me first.

00:23:03.482 --> 00:23:05.250 line:95%,end
- Please walk away.
- Let go!

00:23:05.317 --> 00:23:07.052 line:95%,end
I'm trying to get out of here.

00:23:07.152 --> 00:23:09.321 line:95%,end
She's crying
because I poked her in her nose,

00:23:09.388 --> 00:23:10.989 line:95%,end
but you don't walk up
on a sister like that

00:23:11.056 --> 00:23:13.425 line:95%,end
and think I'm just going to
stand back and say, hey, no get
out of my face.

00:23:13.492 --> 00:23:14.693 line:95%,end
She's lucky I didn't
punch her ass.

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.161 line:95%,end
Really?

00:23:16.728 --> 00:23:17.929 line:95%,end
What would you do?

00:23:19.765 --> 00:23:21.166 line:95%,end
[inaudible] Jill.

00:23:23.535 --> 00:23:24.803 line:95%,end
That's wrong.

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:26.405 line:95%,end
She's being aggressive now.

00:23:26.471 --> 00:23:28.940 line:95%,end
JILL VERTES: Were you there
when I got the water thrown on
me?

00:23:29.007 --> 00:23:31.376 line:95%,end
A whole bottle. By her.

00:23:31.443 --> 00:23:32.978 line:95%,end
She's just a witch.

00:23:33.044 --> 00:23:35.947 line:95%,end
I am so glad
that I wasn't there to see that.

00:23:36.014 --> 00:23:38.850 line:95%,end
I was all the way out
in Hollywood, California

00:23:38.917 --> 00:23:42.587 line:95%,end
looking for a new location
to house the Abby Lee Dance
Company.

00:23:43.355 --> 00:23:45.724 line:95%,end
I mean, come on, what
is Jill thinking?

00:23:45.791 --> 00:23:47.793 line:95%,end
She is a member of this team.

00:23:47.859 --> 00:23:49.928 line:95%,end
Jill, you need to
act like a lady.

00:23:51.163 --> 00:23:55.000 line:95%,end
I have one dancer on my team
that is never happy.

00:23:55.066 --> 00:23:57.302 line:95%,end
I refer to her as
brooding Brooke.

00:23:57.836 --> 00:24:00.071 line:95%,end
I set Brooke up on
date number two.

00:24:00.939 --> 00:24:03.942 line:95%,end
Now, this guy wants to
be a professional dancer.

00:24:04.009 --> 00:24:05.544 line:95%,end
He is fantastic.

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:08.513 line:95%,end
And I think, maybe if Brooke
has a crush on some guy

00:24:08.914 --> 00:24:12.784 line:95%,end
that's at the dance studio
all the time, that really works
hard,

00:24:12.851 --> 00:24:15.687 line:95%,end
that maybe she'll
want to work hard too.

00:24:15.754 --> 00:24:19.357 line:95%,end
I know when I watch Kevin dance,
it puts a smile on my face.


00:24:19.424 --> 00:24:22.894 line:95%,end
I hope he's going to do the same
with Brooke on their date.

Yeah, what do you want?

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:39.511 line:95%,end
I have slices right here.

00:24:39.578 --> 00:24:41.813 line:95%,end
Can we have like four of those?

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:44.516 line:95%,end
Can also have a cannoli?
Or like two cannolis?

00:24:44.616 --> 00:24:46.551 line:5%,start
You're going to sit down
and eat all that, right?

00:24:46.618 --> 00:24:48.053 line:95%,end
- Okay.
- I'm a growing man.

00:24:48.119 --> 00:24:51.756 line:95%,end
I'm feeling a lot of pressure on
me to connect with Kevin.

00:24:51.823 --> 00:24:53.992 line:95%,end
If we don't win,
it's probably going to be my
fault.

00:24:54.059 --> 00:24:56.394 line:95%,end
So is it like,
is it good for you to finally

00:24:56.461 --> 00:24:58.797 line:95%,end
have the difference between like
dancing with them all the time

00:24:58.864 --> 00:24:59.998 line:95%,end
and now dancing with us?

00:25:00.098 --> 00:25:04.536 line:95%,end
Dancing with you guys is like
a lot more like challenging, I'd
say.

00:25:04.636 --> 00:25:06.271 line:95%,end
Because dancing with
them, it's like--

00:25:06.338 --> 00:25:07.973 line:95%,end
- Almost like cheesy stuff.
- BROOKE HYLAND: Yeah.

00:25:08.039 --> 00:25:10.375 line:95%,end
Like jazzy songs, through like--

00:25:11.543 --> 00:25:14.779 line:95%,end
Although I love the girls a lot,
dancing with the seniors

00:25:14.846 --> 00:25:16.047 line:95%,end
is more mature.

00:25:16.147 --> 00:25:18.183 line:95%,end
It was good to change
things up a little bit.

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:20.752 line:95%,end
So how do you feel that
Abby set us up on this date?

00:25:20.819 --> 00:25:23.955 line:95%,end
She actually set me up
on a date a while ago too.

00:25:24.022 --> 00:25:27.125 line:95%,end
Miss Abby always says
no boys, no boys,

00:25:27.192 --> 00:25:30.228 line:95%,end
but this is the second date
she set me up on.

00:25:30.295 --> 00:25:31.463 line:95%,end
And who is this other person?

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:32.597 line:95%,end
So I can go find him?

00:25:33.164 --> 00:25:34.199 line:95%,end
Brandon.

00:25:35.033 --> 00:25:36.101 line:95%,end
But our parents were both there.

00:25:36.167 --> 00:25:37.569 line:95%,end
Like his parents and my parents.

00:25:37.636 --> 00:25:40.171 line:95%,end
Are you surprised your mom
let us come alone?

00:25:40.238 --> 00:25:42.741 line:95%,end
- No, not really.
- We're sharing cannoli.

00:25:42.807 --> 00:25:45.010 line:95%,end
That's as romantic
as you can get.

00:25:45.076 --> 00:25:46.711 line:95%,end
[screams]

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.549 line:95%,end
Here, I'll help you.

00:25:50.615 --> 00:25:53.184 line:95%,end
Oh, I am so sorry.

00:25:53.251 --> 00:25:55.220 line:95%,end
BROOKE HYLAND:
The date's going pretty well.

00:25:55.287 --> 00:25:57.489 line:95%,end
And then I turned around
and sudden, I had cake in my
face.

00:26:11.069 --> 00:26:13.672 line:95%,end
I'll definitely do
a duet with Kevin,

00:26:13.738 --> 00:26:16.274 line:95%,end
but a date, that's
another story.

00:26:17.976 --> 00:26:19.511 line:95%,end
Well, Brooke's finally
right about one thing.

00:26:19.578 --> 00:26:21.646 line:95%,end
No boys, no boys, no boys.

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.716 line:95%,end
You don't have time for boys
if you're dancing,

00:26:24.783 --> 00:26:26.151 line:95%,end
and that's a fact.

00:26:26.217 --> 00:26:29.187 line:95%,end
Now, should Brooke get to know
her dance partner,

00:26:29.254 --> 00:26:32.524 line:95%,end
somebody that she's doing lifts
with, somebody that she has to
trust?

00:26:32.591 --> 00:26:33.892 line:95%,end
Absolutely.

00:26:33.959 --> 00:26:35.894 line:95%,end
It's important for
the two of them

00:26:35.961 --> 00:26:38.897 line:95%,end
to connect on some level,
whatever that is,

00:26:38.964 --> 00:26:40.799 line:95%,end
so that
when they step on stage,

00:26:40.865 --> 00:26:43.435 line:95%,end
that relationship is believable.

00:26:43.501 --> 00:26:45.804 line:95%,end
And that's what I
was trying to do.

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:47.305 line:95%,end
Did they have a good time? Yes.

00:26:47.372 --> 00:26:49.307 line:95%,end
Are they friends now? Yes.

00:26:49.374 --> 00:26:51.843 line:95%,end
Do they trust each other? Yes.

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:55.847 line:95%,end
ANNOUNCER: Taking the stage now,
with the entry number 79

00:26:55.914 --> 00:26:57.983 line:95%,end
is in the teens small
[inaudible] division.

00:26:58.049 --> 00:27:01.486 line:95%,end
[inaudible] not me.

00:27:01.586 --> 00:27:03.188 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER:
First group number

00:27:03.254 --> 00:27:05.790 line:5%,start
we have up today is
my senior company.

00:27:06.358 --> 00:27:09.160 line:5%,start
They've never traveled to one of
our group competitions before.

00:27:09.227 --> 00:27:13.031 line:95%,end
I'm really interested to see
how Brooke does performing

00:27:13.098 --> 00:27:14.833 line:95%,end
with kids that
are older than her

00:27:14.899 --> 00:27:16.301 line:95%,end
rather than younger than her.

00:27:16.368 --> 00:27:19.771 line:95%,end
Because let's face it,
she misses one of those lifts,

00:27:19.838 --> 00:27:22.107 line:95%,end
it's all over for Brooke.

00:27:22.173 --> 00:27:24.409 line:5%,start
[music playing]

00:29:07.345 --> 00:29:09.114 line:95%,end
Well, I know that
I'm always right.

00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:10.882 line:95%,end
Setting these two up on a date

00:29:10.949 --> 00:29:12.984 line:95%,end
was exactly what
needed to happen.

00:29:13.051 --> 00:29:16.321 line:95%,end
Brooke and Kevin stepped on
stage and performed beautifully.


00:29:17.589 --> 00:29:20.291 line:5%,start
I've known Cathy for years,
and she's always

00:29:20.358 --> 00:29:21.659 line:5%,start
been nipping at my heels.

00:29:22.193 --> 00:29:25.263 line:5%,start
While I was away in California,
building my dream,

00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:27.632 line:95%,end
she was building a new team.

00:29:28.099 --> 00:29:29.567 line:95%,end
Kids I've never seen before.

00:29:30.502 --> 00:29:32.937 line:95%,end
And lo and behold,
a dance routine

00:29:33.238 --> 00:29:37.642 line:95%,end
that will go down in history
as classic Candy Apple crap.

00:29:38.743 --> 00:29:40.478 line:5%,start
[music playing]

00:31:43.368 --> 00:31:45.837 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:31:55.546 --> 00:31:57.949 line:95%,end
CATHY NESBITT-STEIN:
"So Chic" was so much fun,

00:31:58.016 --> 00:31:59.918 line:95%,end
and very entertaining.

00:32:01.519 --> 00:32:03.321 line:95%,end
So chic? So chic?

00:32:03.554 --> 00:32:04.856 line:95%,end
I don't think so.

00:32:04.923 --> 00:32:09.560 line:95%,end
The lyrics to the song
were saying "I can't dance".

00:32:11.329 --> 00:32:12.864 line:95%,end
At least Cathy got
something right.

00:32:13.765 --> 00:32:16.534 line:95%,end
Cathy has a most unique
little dancer on her team.

00:32:16.935 --> 00:32:20.305 line:95%,end
He's unique,
because he doesn't really dance,

00:32:20.371 --> 00:32:22.340 line:95%,end
he doesn't take class,
he doesn't train,

00:32:22.407 --> 00:32:24.175 line:95%,end
he doesn't put his feet,
he doesn't turn out

00:32:24.242 --> 00:32:27.645 line:95%,end
and he probably doesn't know
one word of terminology.

00:32:28.446 --> 00:32:29.614 line:95%,end
Can he spin on his head?

00:32:30.114 --> 00:32:31.115 line:95%,end
Yes.

00:32:31.182 --> 00:32:36.621 line:5%,start
But he has that small man thing
going on, and so does daddy.

00:32:37.155 --> 00:32:39.457 line:5%,start
[music playing]


00:34:31.869 --> 00:34:33.971 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:34:38.076 --> 00:34:39.143 line:95%,end
Oh, man.

00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:41.446 line:95%,end
The little man with
the Napoleon complex

00:34:41.512 --> 00:34:43.047 line:95%,end
is crying in the audience?

00:34:43.114 --> 00:34:44.949 line:95%,end
Oh boo hoo hoo.

00:34:45.016 --> 00:34:47.018 line:95%,end
Man up, little guy, man up.

00:34:47.351 --> 00:34:50.488 line:95%,end
That routine I would
have loved to judge.

00:34:50.555 --> 00:34:52.523 line:95%,end
He lip lip-sync the
entire competition,

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:55.460 line:95%,end
so maybe you want to take him
to a karaoke bar

00:34:55.526 --> 00:34:56.794 line:95%,end
instead of a dance competition.

00:34:57.228 --> 00:34:58.796 line:95%,end
And then the technique?

00:34:58.863 --> 00:35:01.099 line:95%,end
Where was it? No turnout.

00:35:01.165 --> 00:35:03.501 line:95%,end
No stretched feet. No lines.

00:35:03.568 --> 00:35:04.569 line:95%,end
Come on.

00:35:04.635 --> 00:35:05.937 line:95%,end
He wants to do a
triple pirouette?

00:35:06.704 --> 00:35:09.407 line:95%,end
You have to learn how to do
a single pirouette first.

00:35:14.579 --> 00:35:16.481 line:95%,end
MICKEY CONSCULLUELA:
Cathy is running the show here,

00:35:16.547 --> 00:35:19.851 line:5%,start
obviously, but as a parent
I think there comes a time

00:35:19.917 --> 00:35:22.653 line:5%,start
when we see our kids are in
need, or are not

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:24.589 line:95%,end
being looked at properly.

00:35:24.655 --> 00:35:26.757 line:95%,end
And I think that's
when a parent steps in.

00:35:28.893 --> 00:35:30.561 line:95%,end
Nobody's home.

00:35:30.628 --> 00:35:32.930 line:95%,end
- Everybody decent?
= KELLY HYLAND: Yes, we're
decent.

00:35:32.997 --> 00:35:34.165 line:95%,end
Hi, how are you?

00:35:35.266 --> 00:35:39.103 line:5%,start
RICK TESTERMAN: I've worn Cathy
before about Mickey.

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:41.239 line:5%,start
Now the proof is in the pudding.

00:35:46.711 --> 00:35:50.248 line:95%,end
My question is, I need to look

00:35:50.314 --> 00:35:51.983 line:95%,end
at what I'm going
to do with my kid.

00:35:52.984 --> 00:35:55.586 line:95%,end
If you feel that Gino
could work with you,

00:35:55.653 --> 00:35:58.923 line:95%,end
and you can utilize Gino,
it'd be a benefit for us all.

00:35:59.991 --> 00:36:02.293 line:95%,end
MELISSA ZIEGLER-GISONI: His goal
is to get Gino on Abby's team

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:03.561 line:95%,end
and off Cathy's.

00:36:03.628 --> 00:36:04.829 line:95%,end
I don't blame him for that.

00:36:05.963 --> 00:36:07.431 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: Oh, [kiss].

00:36:07.498 --> 00:36:09.300 line:95%,end
They're lovers, not fighters.

00:36:09.367 --> 00:36:11.836 line:95%,end
MICKEY CONSCULLUELA:
Congratulations on your winnings
today.

00:36:11.903 --> 00:36:13.037 line:95%,end
The numbers were very nice.

00:36:14.705 --> 00:36:16.440 line:95%,end
JILL VERTES: So what
was that all about?

00:36:16.507 --> 00:36:17.808 line:95%,end
Did he want Gino to come here?

00:36:17.875 --> 00:36:19.443 line:95%,end
He's talking about
moving, I guess.

00:36:20.344 --> 00:36:21.913 line:95%,end
HOLLY FRAZIER:
Cathy is gonna lose her mind.

00:36:21.979 --> 00:36:25.683 line:95%,end
She is gonna lose her mind,
if she hears that Gino's dad

00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:28.886 line:95%,end
basically begged for a spot
on Abby's the competition team?

00:36:28.986 --> 00:36:30.188 line:95%,end
Lose it.

00:36:30.254 --> 00:36:33.925 line:95%,end
Mickey, he proved
to be a lover not a fighter.

00:36:33.991 --> 00:36:37.361 line:95%,end
He was giving me a hug
and a kiss, and schmoozing me.

00:36:37.428 --> 00:36:39.564 line:95%,end
And this and that. Hey, Mickey.

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:41.199 line:95%,end
Don't BS a BSer.

00:36:41.265 --> 00:36:42.533 line:95%,end
That's rule number one.

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:46.504 line:95%,end
Do you think Gino really has
what it takes to be Maddie's
partner?

00:36:46.571 --> 00:36:48.039 line:95%,end
I don't know.

00:36:48.105 --> 00:36:50.741 line:95%,end
But let Gino prove his dancing.

00:36:50.808 --> 00:36:53.678 line:95%,end
He shouldn't have his daddy
doing the work for him.


00:36:54.946 --> 00:36:58.683 line:95%,end
I was in California,
and everything was beautiful.

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:02.220 line:95%,end
I had to come back to all this.

00:37:02.286 --> 00:37:07.124 line:5%,start
The moms, the fighting,
I favor this kid, I favor that
kid.

00:37:07.191 --> 00:37:09.260 line:5%,start
If you're jealous of
somebody else's time

00:37:09.327 --> 00:37:13.164 line:5%,start
that they spend with me,
then sign your kid up for more
lessons.

00:37:13.231 --> 00:37:14.599 line:95%,end
Respect me.

00:37:14.665 --> 00:37:19.070 line:95%,end
Talk about me to your child
with love and admiration.

00:37:19.136 --> 00:37:20.771 line:95%,end
That's how you're going
to get your kid ahead.

00:37:20.838 --> 00:37:24.208 line:95%,end
I mean, come on, Christi,
you think that Melissa is a
liar?

00:37:25.076 --> 00:37:26.344 line:95%,end
You're the liar.

00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:30.381 line:95%,end
You lie right to my face
and you're teaching your child

00:37:30.448 --> 00:37:33.951 line:95%,end
to do the same thing,
and that scares me.

00:37:34.018 --> 00:37:36.387 line:95%,end
Everybody feels bad
for poor Chloe, poor Chloe,

00:37:36.454 --> 00:37:37.955 line:95%,end
because Abby's the big ogre.

00:37:38.022 --> 00:37:43.194 line:95%,end
Nobody feels as bad
for Chloe as I do.

00:37:43.261 --> 00:37:47.698 line:95%,end
Everybody thinks like I'm team
Maddie, and not team Chloe.

00:37:47.765 --> 00:37:51.035 line:95%,end
Guess what?
I'm team Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:37:51.102 --> 00:37:55.473 line:95%,end
It didn't matter who won, as
long as it was one of my team
members.

00:37:55.539 --> 00:37:57.041 line:5%,start
CHRISTI LUKASIAK:
Melissa, I think it's fair to
say

00:37:57.108 --> 00:37:58.709 line:5%,start
you felt that Maddie
was a shoo in--

00:37:58.776 --> 00:38:00.044 line:5%,start
No, I did not for tap.

00:38:00.111 --> 00:38:03.180 line:95%,end
I even told you guys here,
I told Maddie, just let you
know,

00:38:03.247 --> 00:38:04.982 line:95%,end
you're probably not going
to win because tap doesn't--

00:38:05.049 --> 00:38:06.384 line:95%,end
HOLLY FRAZIER: She
looked disappointed.

00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:08.686 line:95%,end
Oh, Maddie looking really upset.

00:38:08.753 --> 00:38:12.223 line:95%,end
Of course she did, but so did
Chloe. She stared at you the
whole time.

00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:13.357 line:95%,end
- No, she didn't.
-Yes, she did.

00:38:13.424 --> 00:38:15.126 line:95%,end
Chloe was happy she got fourth,
but don't go there Melissa.

00:38:15.192 --> 00:38:16.427 line:95%,end
Don't go there with
me either, because--

00:38:16.494 --> 00:38:18.162 line:95%,end
Of course, Maddie,
everybody, Maddie--

00:38:18.229 --> 00:38:20.931 line:95%,end
Just like when Maddie didn't
win Nationals, she cried--

00:38:20.998 --> 00:38:22.633 line:95%,end
Whatever, whatever.

00:38:24.969 --> 00:38:26.103 line:95%,end
HOLLY FRAZIER: I
feel kind of bad

00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:29.273 line:95%,end
that the girls probably
won't get to enjoy their win.

00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:30.908 line:95%,end
KELLY HYLAND: So
all your kissing ass

00:38:30.975 --> 00:38:33.044 line:95%,end
and doing whatever has paid off,

00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:37.014 line:95%,end
because you got Abby 100%
on your side.

00:38:37.081 --> 00:38:39.650 line:95%,end
And aren't you glad that
you went to LA to make sure

00:38:39.717 --> 00:38:41.152 line:95%,end
that she will protect you.

00:38:42.186 --> 00:38:44.689 line:95%,end
CHRISTI LUKASIAK: But you
don't see when you do things

00:38:44.755 --> 00:38:46.791 line:95%,end
against the group that
it hurts our kids.

00:38:50.628 --> 00:38:53.464 line:95%,end
My kids come first to me,
and they always will come first
to me.

00:38:54.765 --> 00:38:57.068 line:95%,end
CHRISTI LUKASIAK: I can't say
that I'm fed up with Melissa's
lying and fakeness,

00:38:57.134 --> 00:39:00.004 line:95%,end
because I've always been fed up
with Melissa's lying and
fakeness,

00:39:00.071 --> 00:39:04.475 line:95%,end
but I think all the other moms
in the room are finally fed up
with it too.

00:39:08.112 --> 00:39:11.015 line:95%,end
- Good job!
- CHLOE: I got fourth for hip
-hop.

00:39:11.082 --> 00:39:13.951 line:95%,end
CHRISTI LUKASIAK:
I know, high-five!

00:39:14.018 --> 00:39:15.619 line:95%,end
And Melissa thought
you were upset.

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:18.522 line:95%,end
MELISSA ZIEGLER-GISONI: You said
that Maddie was so upset, okay?

00:39:18.589 --> 00:39:20.558 line:95%,end
So kiss my ass.

00:39:20.624 --> 00:39:22.026 line:95%,end
Why are you saying this
in front of your kids?

00:39:22.093 --> 00:39:24.061 line:95%,end
Because guess what?
You do it all the time.

00:39:24.128 --> 00:39:26.130 line:95%,end
You talk about my
kid all the time.

00:39:26.197 --> 00:39:27.898 line:95%,end
You say, oh, Maddie's upset.

00:39:27.965 --> 00:39:30.067 line:95%,end
Every time Maddie
doesn't win, oh my God,

00:39:30.134 --> 00:39:31.669 line:95%,end
Maddie's upset, Maddie's upset.

00:39:31.736 --> 00:39:32.770 line:95%,end
Don't play games.

00:39:33.704 --> 00:39:35.539 line:95%,end
She was crying, thank you.

00:39:35.606 --> 00:39:38.275 line:95%,end
Oh, whatever, screw you.

00:39:38.342 --> 00:39:40.845 line:95%,end
I'm done, I'm so over it.

00:39:40.911 --> 00:39:43.080 line:95%,end
You know what?
You're always against me.

00:39:45.216 --> 00:39:48.018 line:95%,end
Tell that trashy girl to stop.

00:39:48.085 --> 00:39:49.120 line:95%,end
We're leaving.

00:39:50.588 --> 00:39:53.457 line:95%,end
When I walk into the dressing
room, and Melissa's mad, she's
leaving.

00:39:53.524 --> 00:39:55.893 line:95%,end
The other kids aren't even in
there, they're all milling
around.

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:58.462 line:95%,end
What is going on
with the Abby Lee Dance Company?

00:39:58.529 --> 00:39:59.697 line:95%,end
Come on, girls.

00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:05.403 line:95%,end
Well, you just saw
So Far This Season.

00:40:06.303 --> 00:40:08.339 line:95%,end
But there's so
much more to come.

00:40:08.672 --> 00:40:09.907 line:95%,end
Look at this, .

00:40:09.974 --> 00:40:12.209 line:95%,end
It's a taste of what's
to come this season

00:40:13.644 --> 00:40:16.247 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER (VOICEOVER):
The Abby Lee Dance Company

00:40:16.313 --> 00:40:17.548 line:95%,end
has one president.

00:40:18.449 --> 00:40:19.450 line:95%,end
And it's me.

00:40:19.517 --> 00:40:21.952 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:40:26.524 --> 00:40:28.192 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER:
We are not going

00:40:28.259 --> 00:40:31.162 line:95%,end
to lose to that evil woman.

00:40:31.228 --> 00:40:33.164 line:95%,end
I'm the only evil
woman in your life.

00:40:34.031 --> 00:40:36.033 line:95%,end
- She likes food.
- CATHY NESBITT-STEIN: Yeah, I
know.

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:38.436 line:95%,end
Did you know, Vivi,
that grandma was--

00:40:39.437 --> 00:40:40.471 line:95%,end
A Granny Apple.

00:40:41.439 --> 00:40:42.540 line:95%,end
She was?

00:40:43.007 --> 00:40:44.175 line:95%,end
MELISSA ZIEGLER-GISONI:
Asia doesn't get a solo,

00:40:44.241 --> 00:40:45.543 line:5%,start
you're leaving?
- Peace.

00:40:45.609 --> 00:40:48.212 line:5%,start
This is about dance,
are you insane?

00:40:48.279 --> 00:40:50.047 line:5%,start
JILL VERTES: You're saying
Abby doesn't do her job.

00:40:50.114 --> 00:40:51.682 line:5%,start
I said she treats
my kid like [bleep].

00:40:51.749 --> 00:40:54.785 line:5%,start
ABBY LEE MILLER: Your kid
is damn lucky, so shut your
mouth.

[cheering]

00:40:58.789 --> 00:41:01.859 line:5%,start
Never in 40 years--

KELLY HYLAND: -- has anyone
been given a solo the day

00:41:05.429 --> 00:41:06.730 line:5%,start
of the damn recital.

00:41:06.797 --> 00:41:08.098 line:5%,start
Ever.

00:41:08.165 --> 00:41:09.300 line:5%,start
- You're out.
- Good.

00:41:09.366 --> 00:41:10.601 line:5%,start
Call the police,
get her out of here.

00:41:10.668 --> 00:41:12.670 line:5%,start
KELLY HYLAND: See you ladies.
Have fun.
