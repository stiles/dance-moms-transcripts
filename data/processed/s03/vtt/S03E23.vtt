00:00:02.402 --> 00:00:05.638 line:5%,start
Chloe and Maddie, you will
be performing a lyrical duet.

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:08.942 line:5%,start
My rival will be there.
I don't want any outburst.

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:11.044 line:5%,start
- And how old are you, double chin?
- Shut up.

00:00:11.111 --> 00:00:13.646 line:5%,start
MC: And in first place, Bad Girls.

00:00:15.348 --> 00:00:17.017 line:5%,start
You're full of [bleep], Kelly.

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:18.485 line:5%,start
Maybe you should get fined.

00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:19.819 line:5%,start
What'd she just said?

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:22.489 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: You know what,
if everyone's jealous, too bad!

00:00:22.555 --> 00:00:24.324 line:5%,start
Let's go, we're going home.

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:25.458 line:5%,start
ABBY: Do you have
anything to say to Brooke?

00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:26.760 line:5%,start
Want to go on a date tonight?

00:00:26.926 --> 00:00:28.495 line:5%,start

Sure?

ABBY: Coming up on Dance Moms.

00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:36.903 line:5%,start
It's the same choreography,
exactly to the tee.

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:38.371 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: It's never happened before.

00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:39.873 line:5%,start
MELISSA: She's not letting them
watch each other.

00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:41.307 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: It's like
the Blair Witch Project.

00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:46.046 line:5%,start
HOLLY: Hopefully, they are using
this time, just talk or let go.

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:48.381 line:5%,start
ABBY: You ruined your entire number.

00:00:48.448 --> 00:00:51.985 line:5%,start
People live with cancer every day
and other people die from cancer.

00:00:52.118 --> 00:00:55.155 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: Melissa will lose her [bleep]
if both of her kids lose.

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:59.259 line:5%,start
JILL: Our plan is to prove
Maddie gets extra privates.

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:00.960 line:5%,start
- Ow!
CHRISTI: You're lying.

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:02.462 line:5%,start
You're lying like--
MELISSA: [bleep] you.

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:04.030 line:5%,start
You know nothing.

Get on the floor.

00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:13.206 line:95%,end
My world is with my girls.

00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:15.442 line:95%,end

Thank you.

ABBY: Hey, how are you doing?
HOLLY: Hi.

00:01:34.194 --> 00:01:37.063 line:95%,end
- You put in some music?
- Always.

00:01:37.464 --> 00:01:39.132 line:95%,end
Y'all look like you're having a good time.

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:41.134 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Hello!
- Hello.

00:01:43.136 --> 00:01:44.404 line:95%,end
Hello.

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:47.073 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Hello.

00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:51.211 line:95%,end
- The apocalypse is upon us.
- Why? What happened?

00:01:51.311 --> 00:01:52.779 line:95%,end
Abby just smiled at me.

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:54.247 line:5%,start
GROUP: Wow.

00:01:54.314 --> 00:01:57.250 line:5%,start
I'm a little speechless,
and I'm never at a loss for words.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.487 line:95%,end
Because that clearly means
that she's just thrilled

00:02:00.587 --> 00:02:01.988 line:95%,end
that we beat Cathy last week.

00:02:02.322 --> 00:02:05.191 line:95%,end
I'm going to run out and see
if I can find something for Chloe to wear.

00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:08.461 line:95%,end
How have you two of you doing?

00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:09.896 line:95%,end
I just don't want to talk to her.

00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:11.231 line:95%,end
It's OK, give it time.

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:13.933 line:5%,start
KELLY: It's been a week since
Christi and I have fought.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.670 line:5%,start
I just feel like Christi
and I went to a place

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.172 line:95%,end
that I didn't like.

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:20.573 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: That was our question
to you the whole time.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.875 line:95%,end
KELLY: My daughter has a solo.

00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:24.244 line:95%,end
What do I have to be upset about?
CHRISTI: That was our question.

00:02:24.344 --> 00:02:26.112 line:95%,end
- Maybe it's you that's upset.
- Stop lying.

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:27.380 line:95%,end
That is why--

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.716 line:95%,end
I'll have my attorney
write you a letter and sue you.

00:02:29.782 --> 00:02:32.685 line:95%,end
I don't think friends
treat friends that way.

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:36.089 line:95%,end
ABBY: Come on, let's go!
Let's go! Come on!

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:37.857 line:95%,end
Shake your leg.
Bring it in.

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:43.329 line:95%,end
This is cause for celebration.
Come on!

00:02:43.396 --> 00:02:45.798 line:95%,end
[cheers]

The Abby Lee Dance Company
took back ownership.

00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:53.640 line:95%,end
We beat the crap out of the Krabby Apple.

00:02:53.873 --> 00:02:55.441 line:95%,end
They were flawless.

00:02:55.508 --> 00:02:58.044 line:95%,end
MC: And in first place, Bad Girls.

00:02:58.411 --> 00:03:03.016 line:95%,end
ABBY: They danced together as one,
outstanding representatives of the ALDC.

00:03:03.082 --> 00:03:04.684 line:95%,end
Didn't that feel good?

00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:09.322 line:95%,end
Hey! Hi.
How are you?

00:03:09.556 --> 00:03:10.924 line:95%,end
- Good?
- Good to see you again.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.126 line:95%,end
Good to see you. What's up?
Glad you're back.

00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:15.261 line:5%,start
We got a warm welcome from Abby.

00:03:15.328 --> 00:03:18.064 line:5%,start
We've been busy bees
but glad to be back here.

00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:20.433 line:95%,end
Without further ado,
I'm going to get to the pyramid.

00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:23.136 line:95%,end
First, Asia.

00:03:23.503 --> 00:03:26.039 line:95%,end
You weren't here.
That's where you end up.

00:03:26.306 --> 00:03:28.041 line:95%,end
She went away to LA for the week.

00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:32.111 line:95%,end
She did a television show and also
some print work for a magazine.

00:03:32.312 --> 00:03:35.715 line:95%,end
I can't blame the kid, but I also can't
put her on top of the pyramid.

00:03:35.782 --> 00:03:40.920 line:95%,end
And next on the pyramid, Nia.

00:03:40.987 --> 00:03:45.525 line:95%,end
In the group, you lag behind a little bit.
I don't want you to be the weak link.

00:03:45.592 --> 00:03:47.594 line:5%,start
I beg to differ.
Nia pulled it off.

00:03:47.694 --> 00:03:50.430 line:5%,start
She looked great as one of four
in that whole group number,

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.367 line:95%,end
and they won against the Candy Apples.
I don't think she deserves to be seventh.

00:03:54.434 --> 00:03:57.103 line:95%,end
Next, Kendall.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.240 line:95%,end
Kendall, you were part of
an award-winning group.


00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.242 line:95%,end
You did a good job.

00:04:02.976 --> 00:04:05.478 line:95%,end
During rehearsal, hmm.

00:04:06.112 --> 00:04:07.480 line:95%,end
You need to be stronger.

00:04:07.981 --> 00:04:13.086 line:95%,end
And Paige, you were
second overall high score.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.489 line:95%,end
Usually, second is the first to lose.

00:04:16.856 --> 00:04:21.060 line:95%,end
But I think you had a great performance.
You should be very proud of yourself.

00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:23.896 line:95%,end
Moving on up, we have Mackenzie.

00:04:23.963 --> 00:04:26.532 line:95%,end
Mackenzie, I have big
plans for you this week.

00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:30.370 line:95%,end
You're up this high on the pyramid
because that's where I expect you to be.

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.007 line:95%,end
That's how well you need to perform.
You got to give me more.

00:04:34.507 --> 00:04:38.745 line:95%,end
Next, we have Chloe and Maddie.

00:04:39.245 --> 00:04:42.181 line:95%,end
Chloe and Maddie,
two professionals out there.

00:04:42.248 --> 00:04:45.018 line:95%,end
It looked like you could have done that
dance eight times a week.

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:48.655 line:95%,end
So congratulations to the two of you.

00:04:49.989 --> 00:04:54.527 line:95%,end
They did a duet.
They danced like seasoned pros out there.

00:04:54.627 --> 00:04:56.462 line:95%,end
They were seamless.

00:04:56.562 --> 00:04:58.998 line:95%,end
It was like one person was dancing
out there on stage.

00:04:59.065 --> 00:05:02.001 line:95%,end
On top of the pyramid, is Brooke.

00:05:05.238 --> 00:05:08.675 line:95%,end
It's about time you danced
like you're 15 years old.

00:05:08.741 --> 00:05:13.513 line:95%,end
Brooke danced with my senior company,
and that's a pretty big task.

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:16.182 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:18.618 line:95%,end
[cheering]

00:05:18.685 --> 00:05:21.187 line:95%,end
And she went out there and performed
just as well as they did.

00:05:21.387 --> 00:05:22.989 line:95%,end
She did an outstanding job.

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:27.160 line:95%,end
So we will be attending
POWERHOUSE dance competition

00:05:27.293 --> 00:05:28.961 line:95%,end
in Fort Wayne, Indiana.

00:05:29.295 --> 00:05:34.434 line:95%,end
We have a very serious,
if you will, group routine.

00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:40.373 line:95%,end
The group routine is entitled,
Living with the Ribbon.

00:05:41.607 --> 00:05:45.178 line:95%,end
Now, you are all familiar
with a pink ribbon.

00:05:45.545 --> 00:05:49.816 line:95%,end
People every day are living with cancer.
They're beating the odds.

00:05:50.116 --> 00:05:52.985 line:95%,end
They're surviving.
Melissa, are you OK?

00:05:53.086 --> 00:05:55.021 line:95%,end
Why did you get choked up there?

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:00.660 line:95%,end
Because my mother died of cancer.
My mom died of a really awful--

00:06:00.793 --> 00:06:03.096 line:95%,end
I mean, she died in nine months.
And it was awful.

00:06:03.429 --> 00:06:04.530 line:95%,end
ABBY: It is.

00:06:04.597 --> 00:06:08.534 line:5%,start
My mom, she had cancer,
and it was an awful cancer.

00:06:08.601 --> 00:06:14.974 line:95%,end
She went really fast.
Um, cancer just sucks.

00:06:15.641 --> 00:06:18.411 line:95%,end
And I think that we're all
affected by it in some way.

00:06:18.511 --> 00:06:22.682 line:95%,end
People are living with cancer.
Children are living with cancer.

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:24.250 line:95%,end
They're surviving.

00:06:24.317 --> 00:06:26.819 line:95%,end
Both of my grandfathers died from cancer,

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:30.056 line:95%,end
and my dad actually has cancer right now.
He has prostate cancer.

00:06:30.256 --> 00:06:33.459 line:95%,end
So doing the dance Living with the Ribbon
really means a lot to me.

00:06:33.793 --> 00:06:36.295 line:95%,end
ABBY: This is a piece
that I've wanted to do.

00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:39.899 line:95%,end
We're going to do it this week.
It's very intricate choreography.

00:06:39.966 --> 00:06:43.369 line:95%,end
Mackenzie, Asia,
you are not in the group routine.

00:06:44.137 --> 00:06:45.738 line:95%,end
You have solos.

00:06:45.838 --> 00:06:50.276 line:95%,end
Asia, it's entitled, Too Hot to Handle.

00:06:51.544 --> 00:06:54.013 line:95%,end
Mackenzie, you will also be doing a solo.

00:06:54.113 --> 00:06:56.449 line:95%,end
It's entitled, Old West.

00:06:56.516 --> 00:06:59.085 line:95%,end
Maddie, you will be doing
a solo this weekend.

00:06:59.152 --> 00:07:02.422 line:95%,end
The name of your routine is, Be Anything.

00:07:03.856 --> 00:07:06.492 line:95%,end
And my last solo will be going to Chloe.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:12.031 line:95%,end
Chloe, the name of your solo is called
You Can,

00:07:13.232 --> 00:07:15.234 line:95%,end
because you can get better.

00:07:15.301 --> 00:07:18.237 line:95%,end
You can listen to your mother
and do what she wants you to do,

00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:21.641 line:95%,end
or you can listen to me
and do what I want you to do.

00:07:22.642 --> 00:07:25.745 line:95%,end
Moms, you're dismissed.
Oh, wait, one more thing.

00:07:25.845 --> 00:07:29.916 line:95%,end
Moms, what happened last week
that took my senior company,

00:07:29.982 --> 00:07:33.186 line:95%,end
who are very focused,
and caused them to look up there--

00:07:33.653 --> 00:07:35.955 line:95%,end
You're full of [bleep],,
Kelly, and you know it.

00:07:36.055 --> 00:07:38.291 line:95%,end
KELLY: Oh, well, maybe
you should get fined.

00:07:38.357 --> 00:07:42.361 line:95%,end
If I see any of that behavior,
you will leave this studio

00:07:42.528 --> 00:07:46.265 line:95%,end
and your child goes with you.
Have I made myself perfectly clear?

00:07:46.332 --> 00:07:47.733 line:95%,end
Yes?

00:07:47.834 --> 00:07:50.203 line:95%,end
All right, you're dismissed.

00:07:50.536 --> 00:07:52.738 line:95%,end
Ladies, spread apart.
Let's warm up.

00:07:57.443 --> 00:08:01.013 line:5%,start
You don't really need to pull
her so hard, just look like it.


00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:02.915 line:95%,end
Yes, go.

00:08:03.349 --> 00:08:05.585 line:95%,end
Tense, ha.
You got to go with her.

00:08:06.052 --> 00:08:10.022 line:95%,end
Now my dad died a very,
very tragic death of cancer.

00:08:10.223 --> 00:08:13.459 line:95%,end
The odds are starting to change,
and that's what we're doing.

00:08:13.526 --> 00:08:16.562 line:95%,end
You could live with cancer,
and you could beat the odds.

00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:17.964 line:95%,end
Any illness--

00:08:18.197 --> 00:08:20.833 line:95%,end
Because the things that you take
for granted, and you think you just--

00:08:20.933 --> 00:08:23.603 line:95%,end
And once it's gone,
that's when you really miss it.

I think this was a great day
for the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:36:14.105 --> 00:36:15.806 line:5%,start
We were victorious.

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:19.343 line:5%,start
We won the overall high score,
and I'm very proud of the kids.

00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:23.581 line:5%,start
It is now time for
our divisional overalls.

MacKenzie got second place in her solo.

00:36:38.963 --> 00:36:42.700 line:5%,start
I know she's disappointed,
and she really wanted first place.

entry number 15 from
Tiffany and Company, Escape.

00:37:15.566 --> 00:37:18.502 line:95%,end
At this point, I really don't know
who I think is going to win.

00:37:18.569 --> 00:37:20.571 line:95%,end
I think they both did things very well.

00:37:20.738 --> 00:37:23.474 line:95%,end
And I think they both did things
that could have been better.

00:37:23.541 --> 00:37:29.013 line:95%,end
Second place, entry number 20

Be Anything.

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:40.725 line:95%,end
I think it was probably a tight call.

It doesn't mean that
one dancer's better than the other.

I'm so happy for Chloe.

00:37:58.943 --> 00:38:01.279 line:95%,end
This is a huge boost to her confidence,

00:38:01.345 --> 00:38:03.748 line:95%,end
and it just proves to Abby
once and for all

00:38:03.914 --> 00:38:06.250 line:95%,end
that Chloe is a force to be reckoned with.

I don't care.

00:38:32.576 --> 00:38:36.180 line:95%,end
Abby said it in front of the other moms,
I'm surprised Chloe won.

00:38:36.247 --> 00:38:38.182 line:95%,end
And she said it right in
front of everyone else.

00:38:38.249 --> 00:38:40.484 line:95%,end
PAIGE:
I think Maddie got really upset

00:38:40.551 --> 00:38:42.486 line:95%,end
whenever she found out
that she didn't win.

00:38:42.687 --> 00:38:44.855 line:95%,end
But I thought
they both did a fabulous job,

00:38:44.955 --> 00:38:47.024 line:95%,end
so I don't think it matters
who the winner is.

00:38:47.391 --> 00:38:49.427 line:95%,end
- Don't be sad.
- I'm not sad.

00:38:49.527 --> 00:38:51.362 line:95%,end
Do you not see me smiling?

00:38:51.662 --> 00:38:52.663 line:95%,end
No, I wasn't.

00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:54.532 line:95%,end
Paige, did you not see me
smiling the whole award?

00:38:54.598 --> 00:38:55.800 line:95%,end
Sorry.

You were great. I mean,
I thought your dance was wonderful.

00:39:07.678 --> 00:39:08.813 line:95%,end
It's beautiful.

00:39:08.879 --> 00:39:10.948 line:95%,end
I mean, it's, you know--

00:39:11.949 --> 00:39:13.517 line:95%,end
it's all good.

00:39:13.584 --> 00:39:14.952 line:95%,end
Hey!

00:39:15.319 --> 00:39:17.254 line:95%,end
Congratulations!

Hey!

00:39:21.726 --> 00:39:22.993 line:95%,end
We had a goof.

00:39:23.294 --> 00:39:26.497 line:95%,end
One of our judges,
they gave Chloe a 99-10.

00:39:26.597 --> 00:39:30.801 line:95%,end
She actually had a 96- 6,
because they gave her a 27- 5

00:39:30.901 --> 00:39:33.604 line:95%,end
in a category that only had 25 points.

00:39:33.804 --> 00:39:37.641 line:95%,end
That means that the overall winner
would have been Maddie.

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:40.945 line:95%,end
Congratulations, Maddie.

00:39:41.112 --> 00:39:42.880 line:95%,end
ABBY: Thank you so much.
We appreciate that.

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:46.417 line:95%,end
MC: Yes, I'm sorry.

00:39:46.684 --> 00:39:48.619 line:95%,end
All right.
Thank you very much.

00:39:50.454 --> 00:39:51.989 line:95%,end
Woohoo!

Everybody, congratulations on the group.

00:39:55.593 --> 00:39:58.996 line:95%,end

congratulations on being great sports.

Mistakes happen.

CHLOE:
The director of the competition told us

00:40:02.266 --> 00:40:03.901 line:5%,start
that there was a mistake
in the scores

00:40:03.968 --> 00:40:06.504 line:5%,start
and that, um, I didn't
really win and, Maddie won.

00:40:06.604 --> 00:40:09.840 line:95%,end
And I was a little upset,
but I was really happy for Maddie.

00:40:09.907 --> 00:40:12.276 line:95%,end
ABBY: Mackenzie, what are you
doing there with the hairdo?

00:40:12.343 --> 00:40:14.645 line:95%,end
What did I tell you?
Never leave home without your bows.

00:40:14.812 --> 00:40:17.081 line:95%,end
Are you kidding me that
it just so happened that

00:40:17.148 --> 00:40:19.316 line:95%,end
Chloe and Maddie's scores
were the only ones,

00:40:19.417 --> 00:40:22.586 line:95%,end
out of the entire competition
with 80-some routines,

00:40:22.787 --> 00:40:25.055 line:95%,end
that were incorrect?
Are you kidding?

00:40:27.425 --> 00:40:30.895 line:95%,end
JILL: So Abby, how did you
discover the discrepancy

00:40:30.961 --> 00:40:33.631 line:95%,end
between the 30 point, the 25 point?

00:40:33.697 --> 00:40:35.299 line:95%,end
ABBY: I didn't.
They came to me.

00:40:35.366 --> 00:40:37.435 line:95%,end
I guess the judges said there's a problem.

00:40:37.501 --> 00:40:38.569 line:95%,end
We have a problem.

00:40:38.636 --> 00:40:40.337 line:95%,end
MC: I'm sorry. You OK?
- Yes?

00:40:40.438 --> 00:40:42.440 line:95%,end
I stole your score sheets.

00:40:42.606 --> 00:40:47.411 line:95%,end
I kept them with me,
and I wanted to say, once again, I was--

00:40:47.578 --> 00:40:49.079 line:95%,end
doesn't happen that often at all.

00:40:49.146 --> 00:40:51.582 line:95%,end
But I wanted to say thank you
for bringing it to our attention.

00:40:51.749 --> 00:40:53.150 line:95%,end
Oh, that's all right.
