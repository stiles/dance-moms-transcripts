ABBY (VOICEOVER):
Previously on "Dance Moms."

00:00:03.136 --> 00:00:06.139 line:5%,start
ABBY: All of you have the
opportunity to come and see me
in LA.

00:00:06.206 --> 00:00:07.774 line:5%,start
Maddie came out.

00:00:07.974 --> 00:00:10.477 line:5%,start
KELLY: She's going to die
alone with no friends.

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:12.312 line:5%,start
I'm sure you wish I would
die in a car accident too.

00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:15.648 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: You saw how much time
she spent on Maddie and
Mackenzie.

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:17.584 line:5%,start
Chloe didn't even
learn her dance.

ANNOUNCER: First runner
up is Miss Maddie.

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:22.389 line:5%,start
-She was crying.
-Thank you.

00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:26.192 line:5%,start
Screw you! You know what?
You're always against me.

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:28.294 line:5%,start
I'm done. I'm so over it.

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:31.031 line:5%,start
ABBY (VOICEOVER): Coming
up on "Dance Moms."

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:34.801 line:5%,start
ABBY: This week, you will be
performing in the annual dance
concert.

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:39.072 line:5%,start
Now, something else is going on.
We're going to throw in a photo
shoot.

00:00:39.272 --> 00:00:40.640 line:5%,start
Shush the beak.

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:43.243 line:5%,start
Stop it. Since when does
your ass go on my stage?

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:46.312 line:5%,start
If you think Christi and Kelly
are going to make your kid a
star,

00:00:46.613 --> 00:00:49.682 line:5%,start
by all means, go.
Pick which side you're on.

KELLY: Never, in 40 years of
being in Abby Lee Dance Company

00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:57.957 line:5%,start
has anyone been given a solo
the day of the [bleep] recital?

00:00:58.058 --> 00:00:59.859 line:5%,start
ABBY: She's going to crap all
over me and talk to me that way

00:00:59.926 --> 00:01:01.628 line:5%,start
in front of my
customers? No way.

Get on the floor.

00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:12.772 line:95%,end
My world is with my girls,

ABBY: Come on. Let's go!

00:01:19.112 --> 00:01:21.147 line:5%,start
This is a busy week.
We have lots to do. Let's go.

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:24.384 line:5%,start
This week is going to be more
hectic and stressful than ever.

00:01:24.517 --> 00:01:27.854 line:5%,start
This is the week of the
Abby Lee Dance Company's

00:01:27.954 --> 00:01:29.355 line:5%,start
annual dance concert.

00:01:29.656 --> 00:01:33.359 line:95%,end
I need these kids to be focused,
because we have a lot to get
done.

00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:36.763 line:95%,end
Let's get to the pyramid.
I want to get through it
quickly.

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:39.165 line:95%,end
We have a very, very
busy week ahead of us.

00:01:39.232 --> 00:01:41.801 line:95%,end
We were the overall
high score winning group.

00:01:41.868 --> 00:01:43.269 line:95%,end
Give yourselves a
round of applause.

ABBY: Paige, you knew
that was coming, right?

00:01:54.647 --> 00:01:55.715 line:5%,start
Why?

[music playing]

00:02:03.323 --> 00:02:04.891 line:95%,end
Just like Maddie's
costume fallout?

00:02:05.158 --> 00:02:07.293 line:95%,end
Paige made a tiny mistake
in the group dance,

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.329 line:95%,end
and Abby puts her at the
bottom of the pyramid.

00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:12.799 line:5%,start
Maddie's strap came off of her
apron, and she didn't even get
in trouble.

00:02:12.932 --> 00:02:14.534 line:5%,start
As a matter of fact,
Abby laughed at her.

00:02:15.368 --> 00:02:17.036 line:5%,start
LYRICS: And then
you kissed me, and--

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:22.942 line:95%,end
LYRICS: Call me up
after a bad day of work.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.712 line:95%,end
I am tired of Abby
mistreating my kids.

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:27.847 line:95%,end
And I'm not going to let her
do it anymore.

00:02:28.047 --> 00:02:30.150 line:95%,end
Did you forget part
of your dance? No.

00:02:30.216 --> 00:02:34.254 line:95%,end
So it was the costume falling
off, right? Paige, do you want
to be here?

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.322 line:95%,end
Because your mother is still
making excuses for you.

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:40.193 line:95%,end
No, I'm not. You made that
excuse for Maddie, so I was
making it for Paige.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.097 line:95%,end
Paige screwed up the whole group
number in front of a live
audience.

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:45.265 line:95%,end
And we won.

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:48.067 line:95%,end
Maddie, just drop and do 20 push
-ups. Kelly will feel better.

00:02:48.368 --> 00:02:51.037 line:95%,end
Go ahead. You're punished.
KELLY: It has nothing to do with
Maddie.

00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:52.438 line:95%,end
ABBY: You're pushed for your
costume. KELLY: I'm talking
about you.

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:58.511 line:5%,start
Every week the moms seem to be
mad at me and Maddie for
something that's happened.

00:02:58.578 --> 00:03:02.482 line:95%,end
I'm sorry that Abby treats us
better than you guys, but it's
not my fault.

00:03:02.715 --> 00:03:03.783 line:95%,end
ABBY: Go.

00:03:04.717 --> 00:03:06.986 line:95%,end
KELLY: Maddie, please don't.
ABBY: Keep going. Go, Maddie.
Give me 20.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.356 line:95%,end
Your costume was your fault. You
should've known it was loose
backstage.

00:03:10.557 --> 00:03:13.326 line:95%,end
You should have had somebody pin
it. I am sick and tired of
fighting with Kelly.

00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:15.328 line:95%,end
This has been going
on for over a decade.

00:03:15.428 --> 00:03:18.097 line:95%,end
She brings her kids to
me to learn new things,

00:03:18.598 --> 00:03:21.734 line:95%,end
to become better dancers,
and then she fights with me.

00:03:22.235 --> 00:03:24.537 line:95%,end
You know what?
I don't care anymore, Kelly.

00:03:25.004 --> 00:03:28.841 line:95%,end
All right. Paige, you're on the
bottom of the pyramid, because
you were perfect.

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.344 line:95%,end
Moving on.
[clapping]

00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:34.914 line:95%,end
Brooke, you're next, because
you were next to perfect.

00:03:35.582 --> 00:03:36.649 line:95%,end
[clapping]

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:38.985 line:95%,end
ABBY: And now we have Kendall.

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:43.323 line:95%,end
I saw an opening turn
that wasn't flawless.

00:03:43.923 --> 00:03:45.792 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.495 line:95%,end
The rest of the
dance, you were great.

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:52.165 line:95%,end
And next, I have Nia.


00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:55.335 line:95%,end
You never roll your eyes.
You're never upset.

00:03:55.435 --> 00:03:57.570 line:95%,end
Your mother never has to say
anything about the solos.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.339 line:95%,end
That's good, but I want more.

00:03:59.706 --> 00:04:02.075 line:95%,end
I want you to come
out and be a star.

00:04:02.475 --> 00:04:05.411 line:95%,end
And next, we have Asia.

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:08.414 line:95%,end
Asia, you were not here
last week to perform,

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:10.817 line:95%,end
because you were
rehearsing for a charity event.

00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:14.387 line:95%,end
ABBY: I think it's wonderful
for you to do charity events.

00:04:14.787 --> 00:04:17.290 line:95%,end
However, charity begins at home.

00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:19.659 line:95%,end
And this is now your home.

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:23.896 line:95%,end
Really, Asia shouldn't be higher
than any of the kids

00:04:23.997 --> 00:04:25.298 line:95%,end
who performed in
the group dance.

00:04:25.365 --> 00:04:27.734 line:95%,end
Why should she get a
spot above all these kids

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:32.905 line:95%,end
who were here over the break,
every day that they could be,
and performed for you?

00:04:32.972 --> 00:04:34.173 line:95%,end
That makes no sense.

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:36.976 line:95%,end
KELLY: And she was training
with another-- another teacher.

00:04:37.143 --> 00:04:38.211 line:95%,end
ABBY: She was doing a--
KRISTIE: A choreographer.

00:04:38.311 --> 00:04:40.813 line:95%,end
You just told us in there
you had training all week.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.182 line:95%,end
Choreogra-- and so what--
KELLY: Training all week.

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:44.517 line:95%,end
Let me get this straight.
Let me get this straight.

00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:47.654 line:95%,end
My daughter, whether she's here,
whether she's in a different
country,

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.355 line:95%,end
she's going to train
with choreographers.

00:04:49.422 --> 00:04:50.823 line:95%,end
She's not going to have
downtime doing meet and greets.

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.126 line:95%,end
OK. Then she shouldn't be
part of our team.

00:04:53.192 --> 00:04:55.662 line:95%,end
Doing meet and greets. She
should be training instead of
doing meet and greets.

00:04:55.728 --> 00:04:57.563 line:95%,end
I would love to take my
kids training somewhere else.

00:04:57.764 --> 00:04:59.899 line:95%,end
Well, then go take them to a
choreographer when you're in--

00:05:00.066 --> 00:05:02.502 line:95%,end
-instead of doing meet and
greets. -You don't understand,
we're not allowed.

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.170 line:95%,end
We're not allowed.
KRISTIE: I feel bad for you.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.139 line:95%,end
-We're not allowed.
-Am I full of [bleep], moms?

00:05:06.205 --> 00:05:09.375 line:95%,end
-Please, somebody say something.
-Get over it. It just happens.

00:05:09.442 --> 00:05:12.211 line:95%,end
It happens here. It happens
there. It happens everywhere.

00:05:12.378 --> 00:05:13.479 line:95%,end
Some things never change.

00:05:13.546 --> 00:05:16.816 line:5%,start
Asia is training. She's not
sitting and playing in LA.

00:05:16.883 --> 00:05:19.419 line:95%,end
She is training with
choreographers, and I think

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:23.389 line:95%,end
that really bothers the moms
that they kind of live in a
bubble.

00:05:23.489 --> 00:05:27.093 line:95%,end
And they don't take the
initiative and keep the girls
training on their breaks.

00:05:27.293 --> 00:05:29.996 line:95%,end
Next on the pyramid,
we have Chloe.

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:34.434 line:95%,end
You were challenged with hip
hop. You were fourth overall
high score.

00:05:35.301 --> 00:05:38.204 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:05:40.106 --> 00:05:46.112 line:95%,end
But you need to put more effort
in. You need to be the best you
can be.

00:05:46.579 --> 00:05:47.680 line:95%,end
And I don't see that.

00:05:47.814 --> 00:05:50.783 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: Did Abby seriously say
that Chloe needed to try harder
last week?

00:05:51.117 --> 00:05:54.487 line:5%,start
Are you kidding me? Maybe you
need to offer some, I don't
know, hip hop classes.

00:05:55.955 --> 00:05:57.757 line:95%,end
Next, Maddie.

00:05:58.558 --> 00:06:00.927 line:95%,end
It kills me that you're
not on top of this pyramid,

00:06:01.427 --> 00:06:04.664 line:95%,end
because I thought that
your solo was outstanding.

00:06:04.964 --> 00:06:08.401 line:95%,end
And I was glad to see you
tapping again. But you still got
second.

00:06:09.168 --> 00:06:10.903 line:95%,end
And on top of the
pyramid is Mackenzie.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.772 line:95%,end
[clapping]

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:16.609 line:95%,end
Mackenzie had a clean landing.
She went out on stage.

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:18.077 line:95%,end
She did what she
was supposed to do.

00:06:18.444 --> 00:06:21.714 line:95%,end
ANNOUNCER: And your highest
scoring elite mini soloist is
Miss Mackenzie

00:06:21.781 --> 00:06:24.317 line:95%,end
with act number 11,
"California Adventure."

00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:26.586 line:95%,end
Congratulations,
you guys. Great job.

00:06:26.986 --> 00:06:29.989 line:95%,end
ABBY: I always say, it's tough
getting to the top,

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:31.524 line:95%,end
but it's even tougher
staying there.

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:34.994 line:95%,end
Turn and look to your right.

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.332 line:95%,end
You going to let that girl
show up and take over?

00:06:40.733 --> 00:06:42.068 line:95%,end
That didn't look very confident.

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:45.838 line:95%,end
Time will tell.

00:06:45.938 --> 00:06:48.307 line:95%,end
KRISTIE: Thanks for keeping
the seat warm, Kenzie, but
Asia's back,

00:06:48.374 --> 00:06:50.176 line:95%,end
and she'll be up top next week.

00:06:50.476 --> 00:06:53.045 line:95%,end
This week we are not
traveling anywhere.

00:06:53.746 --> 00:06:57.817 line:95%,end
You will be performing in
the annual dance concert.

00:06:59.152 --> 00:07:03.156 line:95%,end
Now this is a rough week for all
involved. You're going to have
quick changes.

00:07:03.322 --> 00:07:05.191 line:95%,end
You're going to have
numbers back to back.

00:07:05.324 --> 00:07:08.461 line:95%,end
You're used to lounging around
all day and getting up there for
one number.

00:07:08.761 --> 00:07:11.664 line:95%,end
Well, that ain't it,
kid. That ain't it.

00:07:11.764 --> 00:07:16.836 line:5%,start
The week of the showcase is
always the most stressful week
of the whole season.

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:20.773 line:95%,end
So much going on, a total
of maybe 28 to 30 numbers.

00:07:21.207 --> 00:07:24.577 line:95%,end
As a parent, you can't forget
any part of the costume.

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:29.515 line:95%,end
Kids can't forget their
choreography. It's a lot of
work-- a lot of stress.

00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:33.686 line:95%,end
Let's get to the assignments.
Everybody will be doing a solo.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.957 line:95%,end
However, most of you
will be doing old solos.

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:43.796 line:95%,end
Paige, you have a new solo,
so the pressure is on.


00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:46.666 line:95%,end
I think that Paige
needs a new number.

00:07:46.732 --> 00:07:48.801 line:95%,end
None of Paige's solos
have really stood out.

00:07:49.602 --> 00:07:53.873 line:95%,end
So we're going to let Paige do a
new routine, and Kelly should
appreciate it,

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:57.910 line:95%,end
because I'm taking time out of
my week to spend with her kid.

00:07:58.244 --> 00:08:01.147 line:95%,end
You will be doing a
jazz gymnastic routine.

00:08:01.948 --> 00:08:05.451 line:95%,end
So I need you totally
focused on the task at hand.

00:08:05.952 --> 00:08:09.355 line:95%,end
KELLY: Abby always complains
that Paige is like a step behind
the girls

00:08:09.422 --> 00:08:13.759 line:95%,end
in the group dances. So why
would she give her a new dance?

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.862 line:95%,end
ABBY: All right. I'm going to do
something a little bit
different.

00:08:16.095 --> 00:08:18.965 line:95%,end
Brooke, I am giving you
an amazing opportunity.

00:08:19.599 --> 00:08:24.237 line:95%,end
You are going to sing your big
hit song, "Summer Love Song"
live.

00:08:24.303 --> 00:08:26.405 line:95%,end
[clapping]

00:08:27.273 --> 00:08:30.910 line:95%,end
I thought it would be a nice
treat for the audience to hear
Brooke sing

00:08:30.977 --> 00:08:35.147 line:95%,end
"Summer Love Song" live.
And Kelly should be grateful.

00:08:35.381 --> 00:08:40.786 line:95%,end
The group routine is called
Sugar Babies. I need you to hit
it hard.

00:08:40.953 --> 00:08:45.057 line:95%,end
Just in case we don't have
enough work to do the week of
our big show,

00:08:45.157 --> 00:08:46.993 line:95%,end
we're going to throw
in a photo shoot.

00:08:47.593 --> 00:08:53.165 line:95%,end
You are doing an editorial
campaign for the magazine "Dance
Track."

00:08:53.766 --> 00:08:59.438 line:95%,end
this is the first time that
"Dance Track" magazine has
interviewed kids.

00:09:00.439 --> 00:09:06.412 line:95%,end
And one is going to be chosen
for the cover of the digital
magazine.

00:09:07.613 --> 00:09:10.082 line:95%,end
Spread apart. Let's
go. Let's get working.

00:09:10.216 --> 00:09:12.785 line:95%,end
We're going to start the group
dance first so we're going to
redo the entrance.

00:09:13.486 --> 00:09:16.222 line:5%,start
[music playing]

00:09:18.591 --> 00:09:22.695 line:5%,start
Girls, listen to me. Remember,
this is one of my favorite
Broadway shows.

00:09:22.762 --> 00:09:26.766 line:5%,start
Do not mess it up out there.
The group routine is Sugar
Babies.

00:09:26.933 --> 00:09:29.869 line:95%,end
It's sassy. It's fun.
They look adorable.

00:09:30.303 --> 00:09:31.637 line:95%,end
And there's some comic relief.

00:09:31.837 --> 00:09:36.008 line:95%,end
The girls come out in these
big, sloppy overcoats.

00:09:36.075 --> 00:09:37.209 line:95%,end
They look like bums.

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:38.844 line:95%,end
[humming]
Like it's funny.

00:09:38.911 --> 00:09:40.112 line:95%,end
Put your hands on each other.

00:09:40.379 --> 00:09:43.382 line:95%,end
Like lay on each other like
you're exhausted, like you
always are anyway.

00:09:43.516 --> 00:09:46.586 line:95%,end
And they whip those overcoats
off, and underneath

00:09:46.652 --> 00:09:49.889 line:95%,end
they have white
ruffles, pink sugar.

00:09:50.323 --> 00:09:52.692 line:95%,end
It is adorable.
They look like cotton candy.

00:09:52.825 --> 00:09:57.797 line:95%,end
We have a lot to work on with
the group routine, so I don't
need any drama.

00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:02.301 line:95%,end
I just want to make sure
that I'm not losing my mind.

00:10:03.836 --> 00:10:07.039 line:95%,end
Do you guys agree with me with
the things that I said to Abby
in pyramid?

00:10:07.306 --> 00:10:09.909 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Oh, I was giving you
a preach, sista in my head.

00:10:09.976 --> 00:10:12.645 line:95%,end
OK. Because I don't want to
think that like I'm the only one

00:10:12.712 --> 00:10:13.813 line:95%,end
that thinks any of these things.

00:10:13.879 --> 00:10:15.014 line:95%,end
I was proud of you.

00:10:15.214 --> 00:10:17.583 line:95%,end
ABBY: After the way her mother
talked to me today, there is no
way

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:19.452 line:95%,end
that kid's being in the front
in the middle of this number.

00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:23.489 line:95%,end
She always says everyone is
terrible except for Maddie and
Asia.

00:10:23.589 --> 00:10:28.861 line:95%,end
But the other five girls, she
has nothing nice to say about
those kids, ever.

00:10:28.928 --> 00:10:32.598 line:95%,end
KELLY: Nothing I said wasn't
true. I'm sick of Abby always
dumping on my kids

00:10:32.798 --> 00:10:36.736 line:95%,end
and glorifying Maddie. I'm
excited that Abby is giving
Brooke the opportunity

00:10:36.836 --> 00:10:40.272 line:95%,end
to sing at the showcase this
year, but I don't understand

00:10:40.339 --> 00:10:42.541 line:95%,end
why she's giving
Paige a new solo.

00:10:42.675 --> 00:10:45.611 line:95%,end
Like she always has to give
a negative with a positive.

00:10:46.112 --> 00:10:49.982 line:95%,end
I'm sorry. I can't sit back and
let a woman say that to my
children,

00:10:50.082 --> 00:10:51.283 line:95%,end
and me not defend my children.

00:10:51.384 --> 00:10:53.853 line:95%,end
GIANNA: I think Kelly
is taking it very personally

00:10:53.953 --> 00:10:56.722 line:95%,end
that Paige has to learn
new choreography this week.

00:10:56.856 --> 00:11:00.192 line:95%,end
This is a great opportunity
for Paige to learn a new solo.

00:11:00.459 --> 00:11:02.895 line:95%,end
And Brooke gets to sing in
front of all her friends.

00:11:03.062 --> 00:11:05.364 line:95%,end
And you know what? She's going
to stop giving them to her

00:11:05.431 --> 00:11:06.666 line:95%,end
if Kelly keeps complaining.

00:11:06.799 --> 00:11:09.802 line:95%,end
A recital is doing past dances.

00:11:10.102 --> 00:11:16.142 line:95%,end
I-- I can't bite my tongue and
do that. I've tried. My daughter
is not doing it.

00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:20.146 line:95%,end
I want Abby to give my kids
opportunities. I ask for them
all the time.

00:11:20.579 --> 00:11:23.382 line:95%,end
But I want them to be
a fair opportunity.

00:11:23.716 --> 00:11:28.120 line:95%,end
Having a child learn a solo the
week of the recital, not a fair
opportunity.

00:11:28.454 --> 00:11:29.555 line:95%,end
Nobody does that.

00:11:30.322 --> 00:11:33.292 line:95%,end

What's up?

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:47.273 line:95%,end
ABBY: Those two behave like they
behave, the screaming, the
disrespect

00:11:47.406 --> 00:11:49.742 line:95%,end
to my faculty and to me,

00:11:50.643 --> 00:11:51.844 line:95%,end
is not going to go on.

00:11:52.745 --> 00:11:55.981 line:5%,start
I am still angry about Kelly's
behavior at pyramid yesterday.

00:11:56.449 --> 00:12:00.086 line:95%,end
I don't need Kelly and Christi
acting up during my annual dance
concert.

00:12:00.186 --> 00:12:01.721 line:95%,end
This is a big week for us.

00:12:02.354 --> 00:12:06.726 line:95%,end
And I want these mothers to know
I will not put up with any mom
crap.

00:12:07.193 --> 00:12:12.998 line:95%,end
I don't get why you are
offensive at what I say to your
kid,

00:12:13.232 --> 00:12:15.534 line:95%,end
but you don't get upset
about your kid hearing

00:12:15.901 --> 00:12:17.269 line:95%,end
what Kelly and
Christi are saying.

00:12:17.803 --> 00:12:19.705 line:95%,end
Why is that OK?

00:12:20.339 --> 00:12:21.741 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Abby has a point.

00:12:21.807 --> 00:12:24.677 line:5%,start
Last year, Kelly did pull Paige
and Brooke from the recital.

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:26.178 line:95%,end
Look, it's none
of your business--

00:12:26.245 --> 00:12:27.513 line:95%,end
-OK, Kelly.
-What I do with my kids.

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.682 line:95%,end
-You know what? You're a liar.
-Let's go. Let's go and--

00:12:30.049 --> 00:12:31.117 line:95%,end
-You bring him here.
-Let's go now.

00:12:31.183 --> 00:12:32.318 line:95%,end
I'm not following you.
Bring them right here.

00:12:32.384 --> 00:12:33.619 line:95%,end
I will bring them in here.

00:12:33.719 --> 00:12:35.755 line:95%,end
And you know Abby
is your best friend.

00:12:36.021 --> 00:12:37.123 line:95%,end
Oh, [bleep] you.

00:12:37.389 --> 00:12:39.759 line:95%,end
-Kelly, where are you going?
-I'm going to go home.

00:12:40.192 --> 00:12:41.961 line:95%,end
-What about Brooke?
-I'm not doing it.

00:12:42.027 --> 00:12:43.963 line:95%,end
You don't want anything like
that happening again this year.

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:48.000 line:95%,end
ABBY: So what I'm saying is
why aren't you fighting against
them

00:12:48.067 --> 00:12:49.635 line:95%,end
instead of fighting against me?

00:12:50.202 --> 00:12:53.072 line:95%,end
If you think Christi and Kelly
are going to make your kid a
star,

00:12:53.272 --> 00:12:56.308 line:95%,end
by all means, go.
Pick which side you're on.

00:12:56.942 --> 00:12:58.778 line:5%,start
I'm going to do what
I always have done.

00:12:59.645 --> 00:13:01.881 line:5%,start
The side I'm going to pick
as Maddie, McKenzie side.

ABBY (VOICEOVER):
The annual dance concert

00:13:07.486 --> 00:13:10.256 line:5%,start
is a huge production for
the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:13:10.589 --> 00:13:13.826 line:95%,end
We are the cutting edge dance
studio in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania.

Push! Sharper, harder.

00:13:17.696 --> 00:13:19.665 line:95%,end
Don't look like you're
on the stage dancing.

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:26.238 line:95%,end
Our show is almost like a
Broadway show. I don't want
anybody messing it up.

00:13:26.305 --> 00:13:29.975 line:95%,end
There's one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight kids in
this room

00:13:30.075 --> 00:13:33.012 line:95%,end
that can't remember
what they did yesterday.

00:13:33.445 --> 00:13:34.580 line:95%,end
Yesterday!

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.383 line:95%,end
Do you think Abby's different
during recital week than
competition weeks?

00:13:37.449 --> 00:13:38.784 line:95%,end
Uh, yeah. She's worse.

00:13:38.851 --> 00:13:43.022 line:95%,end
You know what I don't like about
recital? Abby's producing this
mega show,

00:13:43.355 --> 00:13:46.592 line:95%,end
and it's just the stress
of something could go wrong.

00:13:46.659 --> 00:13:47.693 line:95%,end
And what if it's your kid?

00:13:48.027 --> 00:13:49.795 line:95%,end
And it could be something
so simple, so minor,

00:13:49.862 --> 00:13:51.063 line:95%,end
and it gets blown
out of proportion.

00:13:51.163 --> 00:13:54.366 line:95%,end
Because until it's over, and
they take that final bow, I
can't breathe.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.603 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:13:58.103 --> 00:13:59.171 line:95%,end

be Asia's first recital.

00:14:01.273 --> 00:14:02.374 line:95%,end
-Oh, really?
-Mm-hm.

00:14:02.508 --> 00:14:04.810 line:95%,end
So what am I going to be
in for for this recital?

00:14:04.877 --> 00:14:06.478 line:95%,end
Is it going to be cray cray?
[laughs]

00:14:06.545 --> 00:14:09.381 line:95%,end
It is. It's like you just kind
of have to stay out of the way
and just,

00:14:09.481 --> 00:14:11.116 line:95%,end
because there's a lot of
running. And there's a lot of
screaming.

00:14:11.317 --> 00:14:12.651 line:5%,start
ABBY: Asia, you're up.

00:14:13.252 --> 00:14:15.120 line:5%,start
You walk over there and
get ready for the dance.

This is Asia's very first
dance concert with us.

It's the very first time that
everybody's going to see her get
on stage and perform.

Turn your foot out that
you're standing on.

ABBY (VOICEOVER): Are they going
to welcome her with open arms?

I hope so.

00:14:31.737 --> 00:14:35.341 line:95%,end
Because in the dance world,
there is only one first
impression.

00:14:38.744 --> 00:14:42.481 line:95%,end
OK. You understand? Yes?
And you need to be spectacular.

00:14:42.581 --> 00:14:44.550 line:95%,end
All right. See you, sista.

See ya.

One solo down, seven more to go.
Today is going to be a busy day.

00:14:51.323 --> 00:14:54.493 line:5%,start
Each girl's solo has been
specifically selected

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:56.362 line:5%,start
to entertain the audiences.

00:14:56.795 --> 00:14:59.198 line:5%,start
I want everybody to shine.

00:14:59.565 --> 00:15:03.369 line:5%,start
These girls need to do their
best moves, their best routines.

00:15:03.535 --> 00:15:06.538 line:5%,start
I want to see everybody
do their very best.

in here and find out what's
going on.

What's the deal with the solo?

00:15:21.987 --> 00:15:25.324 line:95%,end
It's time for the last solo
rehearsal of the day, and it's
Paige.


00:15:25.424 --> 00:15:28.193 line:95%,end
I told you in pyramid that you
were doing a solo. Everybody
clapped.

Now you don't want
to do the dance.

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:34.366 line:95%,end
Your mother doesn't want you to
do the dance. I don't know
what's going on.

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:39.204 line:95%,end
I've heard some grumblings about
Kelly not being happy that Paige
has a new solo.

00:15:39.972 --> 00:15:41.774 line:95%,end
Well, Kelly is never
really happy, is she?

00:15:41.974 --> 00:15:45.210 line:95%,end
Every single week we go to a
competition, and everybody
learns a new dance.

00:15:45.377 --> 00:15:48.948 line:95%,end
In a new solo, if you forget
what to do, if you mess up,

00:15:49.481 --> 00:15:51.617 line:95%,end
nobody knows but your teachers.

00:15:52.284 --> 00:15:55.521 line:95%,end
Kelly would rather Paige do one
of her old solos that she can't
remember

00:15:55.587 --> 00:15:57.923 line:95%,end
and never did well to begin
with. So what's the point?

00:15:58.424 --> 00:16:01.360 line:95%,end
Let her do something
that's new, simple, easy,

00:16:01.427 --> 00:16:02.895 line:95%,end
and she looks gorgeous doing it.

00:16:02.995 --> 00:16:05.698 line:95%,end
Let Paige go out on stage
and shine, Kelly.

00:16:05.798 --> 00:16:07.366 line:95%,end
You just have to
tell me right now,

00:16:07.499 --> 00:16:11.070 line:95%,end
are we doing a new number that
you're doing on Sunday, or are
you not?

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:14.173 line:95%,end
[ominous music playing]

00:16:15.808 --> 00:16:17.609 line:95%,end
I thought I was
doing an old number.

00:16:18.677 --> 00:16:21.080 line:95%,end
ABBY: I just gave Paige
a golden opportunity,

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:23.415 line:95%,end
but Paige would
rather play it safe.

00:16:27.386 --> 00:16:29.154 line:95%,end
Big mistake, kid. Big.

00:16:30.522 --> 00:16:31.657 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:16:32.825 --> 00:16:34.994 line:5%,start
I said that I would rather do
"Get Up, Get Loud, and Get
Tough"

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:37.262 line:5%,start
because I've practiced
it and it's better.

00:16:37.997 --> 00:16:41.934 line:5%,start
I don't feel like Paige should
have to go up on stage and do a
new solo.

00:16:42.134 --> 00:16:44.069 line:95%,end
If she's the only one
picked to do a new solo,

00:16:44.203 --> 00:16:45.437 line:95%,end
and she's not
comfortable with it,

00:16:45.637 --> 00:16:48.574 line:95%,end
I think she should be able to do
an old one, just like everybody
else is.

00:16:48.807 --> 00:16:50.809 line:95%,end
-You do whatever you
want to do, Peanut.

00:16:51.377 --> 00:16:52.845 line:95%,end
-OK.
-OK?

00:16:53.212 --> 00:16:55.414 line:95%,end
If that's what you want
to do, that's what you do.

00:17:00.686 --> 00:17:03.622 line:5%,start
[music playing]

00:17:05.557 --> 00:17:07.860 line:95%,end
ABBY: The big day for
the annual dance concert

00:17:07.926 --> 00:17:10.195 line:95%,end
is fast approaching,
and some of these kids

00:17:10.629 --> 00:17:13.298 line:95%,end
have never performed for that
many people in their life.

00:17:13.799 --> 00:17:15.801 line:95%,end
This is going to be a big day.

00:17:17.603 --> 00:17:19.538 line:95%,end
OK, girls. Thank you. Dismissed.

00:17:19.605 --> 00:17:23.042 line:95%,end
You want to exit stage
left, prop stage right.

00:17:23.575 --> 00:17:27.312 line:95%,end
This group routine is a mess.
They have a lot of cleaning to
do.

00:17:27.713 --> 00:17:30.315 line:95%,end
But right now, there's another
issue I have to take care of.

00:17:30.783 --> 00:17:33.585 line:95%,end
Paige was chosen in
pyramid to do a new solo.

00:17:35.687 --> 00:17:39.825 line:95%,end
She would prefer not to do a new
solo. So I'm offering it to
somebody else.

00:17:40.192 --> 00:17:42.661 line:95%,end
Would anybody else like
to do a new number?

00:17:45.697 --> 00:17:49.234 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: Wait. Did Abby just
pull Paige's solo from this
recital?

00:17:51.703 --> 00:17:52.771 line:95%,end
Someone raise their hand.

00:17:58.043 --> 00:18:01.447 line:95%,end
Maddie, you have your
"Survivor" number that you
learned?

00:18:04.416 --> 00:18:05.584 line:95%,end
Oh, yeah.

00:18:05.884 --> 00:18:08.554 line:95%,end
Abby really wants Maddie
to do her solo, "Survivor."

00:18:08.787 --> 00:18:12.391 line:95%,end
She's never done it in
Pittsburgh, and Abby wants some
new numbers.

00:18:12.691 --> 00:18:15.461 line:95%,end
So if Paige doesn't want to
do a new solo, Maddie can.

00:18:15.694 --> 00:18:16.862 line:95%,end
[inaudible].

00:18:17.162 --> 00:18:19.064 line:95%,end
KELLY: I love how
you volunteered her.

00:18:19.498 --> 00:18:23.102 line:95%,end
You notice whenever you asked
people, nobody volunteered?

00:18:23.202 --> 00:18:25.137 line:95%,end
She did not volunteer.
You volunteered her.

00:18:25.537 --> 00:18:28.440 line:95%,end
When any one of these kids
were asked to do a new solo,

00:18:28.974 --> 00:18:30.142 line:95%,end
none of them chose to.

00:18:30.843 --> 00:18:32.377 line:95%,end
-That's all I have to say.
-Right.

00:18:32.444 --> 00:18:34.213 line:95%,end
They didn't. So
let's do it again.

00:18:34.279 --> 00:18:37.149 line:95%,end
And I'm going to ask again, and
then you say, me. I'll do
"Survivor."

00:18:37.349 --> 00:18:40.652 line:95%,end
Would anyone like to take
the place and do a solo?

00:18:41.487 --> 00:18:42.588 line:95%,end
Anybody?

00:18:43.755 --> 00:18:45.390 line:5%,start
-Maddie, what?

00:18:49.495 --> 00:18:52.965 line:95%,end
KELLY: Never in 40 years of
being in the Abby Lee Dance
Company

00:18:53.065 --> 00:18:56.969 line:95%,end
has anyone been given a solo
the day of the [bleep] recital!

00:18:57.069 --> 00:18:58.570 line:95%,end
ABBY: Kelly, you're out.
-Ever!

00:18:58.704 --> 00:18:59.805 line:95%,end
You're out. Call the police.

00:18:59.872 --> 00:19:00.939 line:95%,end
KELLY: I'm done.
-Get her out of here.

00:19:01.006 --> 00:19:02.808 line:95%,end
KELLY: This whole
thing just isn't fair.

00:19:02.975 --> 00:19:05.077 line:95%,end
If Abby wants to play her games,
that's fine.

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:06.645 line:95%,end
But me and my girls are leaving.

00:19:06.712 --> 00:19:08.680 line:95%,end
ABBY: Get her out of here.
-Please. Take me. Let's go.

00:19:08.747 --> 00:19:11.183 line:95%,end
ABBY: Get her out of this
auditorium. -Let's go. Let's go.

00:19:11.283 --> 00:19:12.851 line:95%,end
ABBY: You're finished.
You're out. Goodbye.

00:19:13.018 --> 00:19:14.119 line:95%,end
KELLY: Thank you.


00:19:16.989 --> 00:19:19.725 line:5%,start
[music playing]

00:19:20.392 --> 00:19:21.527 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: OK, let me--

00:19:21.593 --> 00:19:23.729 line:5%,start
I'm going to call Kelly and see
if she's planning on coming.

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:28.667 line:5%,start
I really think Kelly made a
mistake by walking out on our
dance concert.

00:19:28.834 --> 00:19:32.404 line:95%,end
This is a huge opportunity for
Brooke, and I would love to see
her sing.

00:19:32.504 --> 00:19:33.672 line:95%,end
I'm really sad for her.

00:19:33.872 --> 00:19:35.908 line:95%,end
We're here at the studio
with all of the moms.

00:19:35.974 --> 00:19:37.743 line:95%,end
We were just wondering
if you were coming today.

00:19:39.311 --> 00:19:41.647 line:95%,end
Are you planning on coming
at all for the recital?

00:19:43.248 --> 00:19:45.684 line:95%,end
I really do expect
Kelly to be back.

00:19:45.951 --> 00:19:48.187 line:95%,end
I really think that she'll
be back for the showcase.

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:50.055 line:95%,end
She won't do this to her kids.

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:54.726 line:95%,end
ABBY: Hello.
-Hello.

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.495 line:95%,end
-Cute!
-Whoa.

00:19:56.595 --> 00:20:01.500 line:5%,start
I ordered all the girls
brand new warm-ups, free of
charge.

00:20:01.833 --> 00:20:05.904 line:95%,end
This is my new dancewear line,
and my new cover-up line.

00:20:06.004 --> 00:20:08.173 line:95%,end
It's like loungewear,
streetwear, dancewear.

00:20:08.707 --> 00:20:10.242 line:95%,end
Those are cute.

00:20:12.311 --> 00:20:14.746 line:95%,end
HOLLY: They do appreciate it.
-I like the jackets.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:17.716 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: Abby giving the girls
the whole dancewear line

00:20:17.783 --> 00:20:19.251 line:5%,start
isn't about giving them a gift.

00:20:19.351 --> 00:20:21.453 line:5%,start
It's more about turning them
into dancing billboards,

00:20:21.553 --> 00:20:24.523 line:95%,end
because you know, isn't it all
about making Abby more money?

00:20:24.957 --> 00:20:30.495 line:5%,start
Girls, with Paige and Brooke
out, it's just everybody has to
work harder.

00:20:30.696 --> 00:20:34.032 line:95%,end
I have to re-block
the entire group number.

00:20:34.533 --> 00:20:37.869 line:95%,end
Once again, everybody
else is working

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:41.240 line:95%,end
while Paige and Brooke
don't have to work.

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:44.910 line:95%,end
Kendall, you need to arch
over that [inaudible] right.

00:20:44.977 --> 00:20:47.012 line:95%,end
You're never moving your body
and your head. Move it.

00:20:47.779 --> 00:20:48.847 line:95%,end
Jazz hands.

00:20:49.114 --> 00:20:51.383 line:95%,end
I think what really
set Kelly over the edge

00:20:51.717 --> 00:20:56.021 line:95%,end
was the fact that Abby offered
up a solo and nobody took it.

00:20:56.188 --> 00:20:57.356 line:95%,end
MOM: Not one person.

00:20:57.422 --> 00:20:59.992 line:95%,end
And then she said, Maddie,
you're going to do this solo.

00:21:00.092 --> 00:21:02.227 line:95%,end
Who wants a solo?
And then Maddie raised her hand.

00:21:02.294 --> 00:21:04.396 line:95%,end
But Maddie was the only one
who had a solo to give up.

00:21:04.463 --> 00:21:07.399 line:95%,end
-Right. Right.
-But Abby said, Maddie, raise
your hand.

00:21:07.466 --> 00:21:08.567 line:95%,end
-Do your new solo.
-Exactly.

00:21:08.634 --> 00:21:11.203 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: It wasn't Maddie
who was making the decision for
her.

00:21:11.303 --> 00:21:15.741 line:95%,end
-Right. And that's what Abby
does. CHRISTI: At the expense of
Kelly's kids.

00:21:15.841 --> 00:21:17.743 line:5%,start
Kelly freaking out and
leaving, it's new to me,

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:20.879 line:5%,start
but talking to the other moms,
it's like getting your tires
rotated.

00:21:21.313 --> 00:21:22.547 line:95%,end
You do it once a year.

00:21:22.614 --> 00:21:24.182 line:95%,end
ABBY: All right. One more time,
and we're going.

00:21:24.283 --> 00:21:25.584 line:95%,end
So pray Asia does it right.

00:21:25.817 --> 00:21:29.054 line:95%,end
Five, six, seven, go.
Drag, ball, change.

00:21:29.621 --> 00:21:31.823 line:95%,end
Twist, twist, twist.
And that's great.

00:21:32.324 --> 00:21:33.992 line:95%,end
Very impressed with you, Chloe.

00:21:34.459 --> 00:21:36.762 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: You know,
it really is nice to hear Abby

00:21:36.862 --> 00:21:38.597 line:95%,end
say something complimentary
towards Chloe.

00:21:38.797 --> 00:21:40.932 line:95%,end
And it's amazing that
those couple little words

00:21:40.999 --> 00:21:43.635 line:95%,end
will probably go so far
with her self-esteem.

00:21:44.169 --> 00:21:45.337 line:95%,end
I'm going upstairs.

00:21:46.305 --> 00:21:49.875 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: That makes me sad
that Brooke and Paige are not
dancing.

00:21:49.941 --> 00:21:51.810 line:95%,end
-Is this the beginning of the
end? -No.

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:54.613 line:95%,end
I think the team
is falling apart a little bit,

00:21:54.713 --> 00:21:56.915 line:95%,end
but we always come
back together.

00:21:57.115 --> 00:21:58.583 line:95%,end
Abby was pretty pissed.

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:01.687 line:95%,end
I mean, Kelly has put her
through the wringer a lot.

00:22:02.921 --> 00:22:05.023 line:95%,end
-It goes both ways.
-Woo.

00:22:05.157 --> 00:22:06.425 line:95%,end
-It goes both ways.
-Woo.

00:22:06.558 --> 00:22:09.461 line:95%,end
All Kelly had to do was
say, OK, Brook can sing,

00:22:09.528 --> 00:22:11.029 line:95%,end
and Paige will do a new solo.

00:22:11.096 --> 00:22:15.033 line:95%,end
Jill, here I am, up on
the observation mezzanine.


00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:16.702 line:95%,end
I don't want to be
there with these moms,

00:22:16.802 --> 00:22:19.604 line:95%,end
and I certainly don't want to
overhear what they have to say.

00:22:19.971 --> 00:22:23.041 line:95%,end
But I'm going to let Jill
know that she is in the show.

00:22:23.275 --> 00:22:25.477 line:95%,end
I am giving you the
opportunity of a lifetime.

00:22:25.544 --> 00:22:26.611 line:95%,end
OK.

00:22:26.678 --> 00:22:28.947 line:95%,end
You will be performing in the
Sunday matinee at 12:00 noon.

00:22:29.014 --> 00:22:30.082 line:95%,end
JILL: OK.

00:22:30.148 --> 00:22:31.783 line:95%,end
ABBY: We need to block your
entrance and your exit.

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:34.019 line:5%,start
JILL: I am so
excited for my duet.

00:22:34.252 --> 00:22:37.155 line:5%,start
I'm doing a tango number
with my old friend, Jimmy

00:22:37.322 --> 00:22:38.790 line:95%,end
from Night and Day Dance Studio.

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:41.493 line:95%,end
I walk in. I walk half way.

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:45.163 line:95%,end
And then I look back, and
then we start our tango,

00:22:45.464 --> 00:22:46.898 line:95%,end
and then we do a dip.

00:22:46.998 --> 00:22:48.600 line:95%,end
So right now, your
butt's to the audience.

00:22:49.067 --> 00:22:50.569 line:95%,end
Well, it's like this.

00:22:51.103 --> 00:22:52.871 line:95%,end
And then I come
around. And then I--

00:22:52.938 --> 00:22:54.606 line:95%,end
[clap clap]
He comes up and then we--

00:22:54.706 --> 00:22:57.676 line:95%,end
ABBY: Watch, Jill, because your
arm fat jiggles when you do
that.

00:22:57.876 --> 00:23:00.212 line:95%,end
JILL: I'm the first to say
I need to lose a little weight,

00:23:00.479 --> 00:23:05.217 line:95%,end
but it's kind of comical to have
Abby yelling at me about my arm
fat jiggling.

00:23:05.283 --> 00:23:07.853 line:95%,end
[laughing]
When I clap, I'm trying not to
give the--

00:23:08.453 --> 00:23:10.389 line:95%,end
[clap clap]
ABBY: All right. Thank you.

shoot for "Dance Track"

choreographers, casting agents,

directors, producers,
you name it.

00:23:40.585 --> 00:23:44.456 line:95%,end
It's a shame that Kelly went
berserk at the dance concert
dress rehearsal

00:23:44.523 --> 00:23:45.891 line:95%,end
and took her kids with her.

00:23:46.091 --> 00:23:48.693 line:95%,end
I could definitely see
Paige winning this cover.

00:23:49.027 --> 00:23:51.363 line:95%,end

Here we go.

a character to help them bring
life and energy to their
pictures.

Chloe is the rebel rocker.

ABBY: Maddie is the teacher's
pet, of course.

PHOTOGRAPHER: Hello.

00:24:09.815 --> 00:24:13.552 line:95%,end
ABBY: Asia is the girl with
the big reputation, you know,
sassy.

00:24:13.785 --> 00:24:14.986 line:95%,end
PHOTOGRAPHER: OK.

00:24:15.687 --> 00:24:17.789 line:95%,end

PHOTOGRAPHER: Ooh.

00:24:19.925 --> 00:24:22.894 line:95%,end
ABBY: Mackenzie is the
bookworm, the nerd.

00:24:23.462 --> 00:24:24.596 line:95%,end
PHOTOGRAPHER: That's pretty.

00:24:24.729 --> 00:24:28.633 line:95%,end
ABBY: And Nia is the athlete.
She's portraying a gymnast.

Seeing the girls
in their element, dressed,

00:24:32.504 --> 00:24:35.640 line:5%,start
having fun in front
of the camera, it's fun.

00:24:36.475 --> 00:24:39.277 line:95%,end
It's a shame that Brooke and
Paige aren't here to enjoy this
experience.

00:24:39.511 --> 00:24:41.713 line:95%,end
Abby, I have a feeling since

00:24:42.714 --> 00:24:46.418 line:95%,end
this happened last year at
recital, that Paige and Brooke
will be back.

00:24:46.485 --> 00:24:48.553 line:95%,end
No. She quit.

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:51.890 line:95%,end
She's going to crap all over me
and talk to me that way in front
of my customers?

00:24:51.957 --> 00:24:53.959 line:95%,end
No way. I cannot allow that.

00:24:54.192 --> 00:24:55.594 line:95%,end
I will not allow that.

00:24:55.727 --> 00:24:59.531 line:95%,end
I was a fool for letting these
moms coerce me into taking Kelly
back.

00:25:00.065 --> 00:25:04.536 line:95%,end
Kelly is more concerned with
herself than she is with any
needs of her child.

00:25:04.736 --> 00:25:06.938 line:5%,start
She's not going to be
wasting my time anymore.

Today is the day. The annual

It's so exciting. We
have a red carpet.

00:25:19.284 --> 00:25:23.154 line:95%,end
You can feel the excitement in
the air. We are expecting 1,300
people.

00:25:23.255 --> 00:25:26.391 line:95%,end
It's a sold-out crowd.
When they hit that stage,

00:25:26.458 --> 00:25:28.593 line:95%,end
there better be
electricity in the air.

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:30.695 line:95%,end
This is going to be fabulous.

-Oh, there's the star.

Hey.

00:25:38.336 --> 00:25:40.372 line:95%,end
-Hello, ladies.
-Hi.

00:25:40.472 --> 00:25:42.073 line:95%,end
-How is everybody?
-Good.

Everybody has a solo.

Asia's back. She has a solo.

00:25:50.615 --> 00:25:54.085 line:95%,end
And Maddie, I think you
stepped up to the plate,

00:25:54.219 --> 00:25:57.155 line:95%,end
and you're going to do some new
material that nobody has seen
yet.

00:25:57.255 --> 00:26:00.325 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Maddie has a lot on
her plate today. She has two
solos.

00:26:00.525 --> 00:26:04.629 line:5%,start
She has her original tap solo
and her new solo, "Survivor,"

00:26:04.696 --> 00:26:06.398 line:95%,end
that is replacing Paige's spot.

00:26:06.598 --> 00:26:09.100 line:95%,end
And you have a new group
routine, "Sugar Babies."

00:26:09.301 --> 00:26:11.703 line:95%,end
it's fun. It's comic relief.

00:26:11.903 --> 00:26:15.340 line:95%,end
This is the best opportunity
for these girls to shine.

00:26:16.141 --> 00:26:19.578 line:95%,end
At this point in the season,
they should be at their peak.

00:26:19.778 --> 00:26:22.013 line:95%,end
I almost forgot about this
whole photo shoot thing.

00:26:22.547 --> 00:26:25.183 line:95%,end
-I know it's a big deal for you
guys. -Oh, these children
haven't forgotten.

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:27.185 line:95%,end
ABBY: Oh, I know. I know
they haven't forgotten about it.

00:26:27.285 --> 00:26:28.587 line:95%,end
So I found Sandra.

Hey.

-Ah!
-All right.

00:26:34.859 --> 00:26:36.328 line:95%,end
Abby doesn't even know
who's on the cover.

00:26:36.394 --> 00:26:37.529 line:95%,end
I don't.

00:26:37.596 --> 00:26:41.933 line:95%,end
So we came to the Abby Lee Dance
Company specifically to find

00:26:42.367 --> 00:26:48.573 line:95%,end
our very first cover person that
will be a professional child
dancer.

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:53.778 line:95%,end
It's pretty big. So I would like
to congratulate the winner,

00:26:54.379 --> 00:26:57.916 line:95%,end
and announce the next cover
of "Dance Track" magazine.

00:26:59.117 --> 00:27:00.619 line:95%,end

Oh, that's really cool.

JILL: I have to say I am truly
shocked that Kendall won.

00:27:19.437 --> 00:27:23.875 line:5%,start
Not that she wouldn't be good at
it, or be amazing and beautiful,

00:27:23.942 --> 00:27:28.346 line:5%,start
just the fact that Maddie and
Mackenzie always seem to get
that special part.

I was really surprised
that it was Kendall.

So quick changes,

Some of you have duets.

Some of you have trios. Break a

moment in the spotlight,

Jill, never again are you
dancing in my show.

What are you doing out
there? Showboating?

00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:30.988 line:95%,end
No. Just giving her roses.

00:36:31.055 --> 00:36:33.324 line:95%,end
I know, but since when
does your ass go on my stage?

00:36:34.158 --> 00:36:37.094 line:95%,end
So listen to me, ladies,
you're here as mom.

Let's get the kids ready, and
let's do the show the way it was

It was a great performance.

Everybody had a good time.

I'm sure if there's any critics
in the audience,

00:37:19.937 --> 00:37:22.106 line:95%,end

to give us a thumbs up.

I've never seen it before,
so I got to see it.

00:38:15.793 --> 00:38:20.231 line:95%,end
I think it was-- it's evident
that Maddie did that because of
Abby.

00:38:21.332 --> 00:38:25.336 line:95%,end
I mean Abby volunteered her up,
and said Maddie, this is what
you're going to do.

00:38:25.803 --> 00:38:27.838 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: But I think that
that's why Kelly was upset.

00:38:28.105 --> 00:38:31.742 line:95%,end
Abby made a point to volunteer
Maddie and say, you'll step up
to the plate.

00:38:32.043 --> 00:38:36.247 line:95%,end
And she just said, once again,
you're making my kids look
subpar,

00:38:36.314 --> 00:38:39.250 line:95%,end
and Maddie look like
that she's above everyone else.

00:38:40.318 --> 00:38:42.753 line:95%,end
-Have you talked to Kelly?
-Um, I called her.

00:38:43.421 --> 00:38:44.488 line:95%,end
Is she mad at you?

00:38:44.889 --> 00:38:47.858 line:95%,end
You know, I said, Kelly,
it wasn't Maddie's fault.

00:38:48.125 --> 00:38:49.260 line:95%,end
No, I did nothing wrong.

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:52.096 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Well, I think Kelly
thought that you should have
stopped it.

00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:54.098 line:95%,end
-Because Kelly is mad.
-Oh, she is?

00:38:54.165 --> 00:38:56.867 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Yeah. But she wanted
her to step-- no. No, no, no.

00:38:56.934 --> 00:38:58.969 line:95%,end
She wanted Melissa to
step in and say, no.

00:38:59.036 --> 00:39:01.939 line:95%,end
You know what? My daughter did
what she did, and I think

00:39:02.006 --> 00:39:03.674 line:95%,end
any of the other kids
would have did the same thing.

Um, there's a few, you know,
things I want to go over.

00:39:33.571 --> 00:39:38.642 line:95%,end
Asia, you did an entire routine
with your pants on backwards.

00:39:40.411 --> 00:39:42.179 line:95%,end
But don't laugh. It's not funny.

00:39:42.847 --> 00:39:44.382 line:95%,end
Someone is dressing you,
and I understand that.

00:39:44.849 --> 00:39:48.619 line:95%,end
I always check her, and in the
circumstances, I didn't even
know.

00:39:48.719 --> 00:39:50.554 line:95%,end
You're not sitting in the
audience. You're backstage.

00:39:50.621 --> 00:39:52.456 line:95%,end
-You're in that quick-change
room. -Yeah. I'm looking at a
list that says--

00:39:52.823 --> 00:39:54.191 line:95%,end
it says her name on 18.

00:39:54.291 --> 00:39:56.660 line:95%,end
-I popped her into Brooke's
spot. -But no one told me.

00:39:57.328 --> 00:39:58.996 line:95%,end
Well, wait. She only
has two numbers.

00:39:59.163 --> 00:40:00.931 line:95%,end
OK, these kids did like 15,

00:40:00.998 --> 00:40:03.234 line:95%,end
and they all had their pants
on straight. Just saying.

00:40:03.334 --> 00:40:06.570 line:95%,end
Now, I want the name of who put
that costume on you backwards.

00:40:06.871 --> 00:40:10.040 line:5%,start
It was my responsibility.

00:40:12.977 --> 00:40:15.446 line:95%,end
Thank you, Asia.
It's what she wants to hear.

00:40:15.579 --> 00:40:17.381 line:95%,end
Thank you for ending that.

onstage, suspended for a month.

Asia has her costume on
backwards, and it's, haha, no
big deal.

Now-- now, here is the
question of the day.

00:40:27.591 --> 00:40:30.127 line:95%,end
-Is Jill going to be on the
pyramid? -No, no. No.

00:40:30.194 --> 00:40:31.662 line:95%,end
She said she'll give you a head
shot. She's going to bring it.

00:40:31.762 --> 00:40:33.931 line:95%,end
-She has a head shot.
-She's going to bring it.

00:40:34.198 --> 00:40:37.134 line:95%,end
Say what you will about Abby,
but she does put on a good show.

00:40:37.601 --> 00:40:41.038 line:95%,end
And I really have to
applaud Kelly for passing up

00:40:41.105 --> 00:40:44.942 line:95%,end
all of the opportunities her
kids had this week at the
recital to prove a point.

back, because without her, I'm
on my own.
