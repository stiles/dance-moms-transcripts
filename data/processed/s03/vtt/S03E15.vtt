ABBY: Previously on "Dance Moms"--

00:00:03.436 --> 00:00:06.239 line:5%,start
-I got married!
CHRISTI: Wait, what?

00:00:06.306 --> 00:00:08.174 line:5%,start
I'm dismissing you today.

00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:10.677 line:5%,start
-Don't slam my door.
-I'll slam whatever I want.

00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:13.013 line:5%,start
I keep moving your opposite
Maddie, and you keep moving.

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:13.913 line:5%,start
Wake up!

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.415 line:5%,start
This is what she does to you every week,

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:17.250 line:5%,start
and you let her psyche you out.

00:00:17.317 --> 00:00:18.785 line:5%,start
Abby, your guest is here.

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:20.587 line:5%,start
-Is she fabulous?
GIANNA: Yeah.

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:23.223 line:5%,start
There is some hairogrophy
going on down there!

00:00:24.324 --> 00:00:26.226 line:5%,start
ABBY: Chloe, that was inappropriate.

00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:28.762 line:5%,start
These are your girls.
This is your name on their backs.

00:00:28.828 --> 00:00:30.697 line:5%,start
I'm really nervous.

00:00:30.764 --> 00:00:32.332 line:5%,start
ABBY: Coming up on "Dance Moms"--

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.000 line:5%,start
We have a new member of the team.

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:36.669 line:5%,start
Asia will be joining
the Abby Lee Dance Company,

00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:38.338 line:5%,start
and I want to warn you.

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:40.840 line:5%,start
Here's your choreographer for this week.

00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:43.710 line:5%,start
She is not going to stuff her dog.

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:44.711 line:5%,start
[CRYING] I'm sorry.

00:00:44.778 --> 00:00:45.912 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: Now that we
know that you don't want

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:47.514 line:5%,start
us to be honest and express our feelings,

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.015 line:5%,start
we'll make sure we don't
do that in front of you.

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:52.452 line:5%,start
You need to stay focused. And we need
to take this opportunity to stay here.

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:53.887 line:5%,start
You make an ass of yourself!

00:00:53.953 --> 00:00:56.122 line:5%,start
Do you think I'm giving up
my whole life to deal

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:58.792 line:5%,start
with that piece of crap? No!

00:00:58.858 --> 00:01:00.727 line:5%,start
She has dirt under my feet!

00:01:00.794 --> 00:01:03.196 line:95%,end
[THEME MUSIC]

00:01:03.263 --> 00:01:06.633 line:95%,end
(SINGING) Get up!
Get on the floor!

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:11.805 line:95%,end
My world is with my girls,
living on the dance floor.

00:01:12.672 --> 00:01:15.675 line:95%,end
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:16.943 --> 00:01:19.979 line:95%,end
ABBY: Come on, girls! Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go! Come on!

00:01:21.681 --> 00:01:24.517 line:95%,end
Congratulations!
Another good weekend.

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:26.352 line:95%,end
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:30.790 line:95%,end
ANNOUNCER: And in first place,
entry number 76, "Gold Digger."

00:01:30.857 --> 00:01:33.760 line:95%,end
ABBY: You were the Overall
High Score Junior Group.

00:01:33.827 --> 00:01:35.295 line:95%,end
That's important.
That's where we wanted to be.

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:36.563 line:5%,start
We wanted to be number one.

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:39.866 line:5%,start
We're on a winning streak,
and I want it to continue.

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:41.401 line:95%,end
Let's get to the pyramid.

00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:44.170 line:95%,end
I'm going to start on
top because that's easy.

00:01:44.237 --> 00:01:47.607 line:95%,end
Maddie.
Maddie, you were the overall high score.

00:01:47.674 --> 00:01:51.377 line:95%,end
I gave you a job to do,
to teach your sister,

00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:53.513 line:95%,end
and to make sure that she could
keep up with you.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.748 line:95%,end
And that's what you did.
You took charge.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.421 line:95%,end
And next on the pyramid, Paige.

00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:03.857 line:95%,end
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:03.923 --> 00:02:06.159 line:95%,end
You did a great job. It was darling.

00:02:06.226 --> 00:02:09.596 line:5%,start
PAIGE: Miss Abby always says it's harder
to get on top of the pyramid,

00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:14.200 line:95%,end
but it's tougher to stay there.
And I showed her that I could stay there.

00:02:14.267 --> 00:02:17.137 line:5%,start
ABBY: Next, Kendall.

00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:19.973 line:5%,start
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:22.442 line:95%,end
Kendall, you were third place, overall.

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:26.079 line:95%,end
Hey, it wasn't second. Thank goodness.

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:30.450 line:5%,start
Of course Abby tries to motivate
in a negative way.

00:02:30.517 --> 00:02:32.986 line:95%,end
I believe in Kendall.
She's trying as hard as she can.

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:36.923 line:95%,end
And she will only get better
day after day after day.

00:02:38.424 --> 00:02:40.827 line:95%,end
ABBY: We have Chloe.

00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:44.998 line:95%,end
Chloe, you were the first Overall High
Score in the Junior Solo Division.

00:02:47.267 --> 00:02:50.270 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: She won First Overall
in her first solo back.

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:52.372 line:5%,start
I think Chloe deserves to be higher.

00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:55.208 line:5%,start
And next, Nia.

00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:59.312 line:5%,start
Now, Nia, once again,
you flew under the radar.

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.348 line:95%,end
You didn't draw my eyes in a negative way.

00:03:02.415 --> 00:03:05.919 line:95%,end
That's very admirable. Next, Mackenzie.

00:03:07.387 --> 00:03:11.057 line:95%,end
I will stand by my decision that you
should not have been in the group number.

00:03:11.124 --> 00:03:13.092 line:5%,start
MELISSA: It would have been
nice to see Maddie and Mackenzie

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:14.961 line:5%,start
together at the top of the pyramid.

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:17.397 line:95%,end
But I know that Mackenzie
did make a few little mistakes,

00:03:17.463 --> 00:03:19.866 line:95%,end
so she had to be put down a few notches.

00:03:19.933 --> 00:03:23.536 line:5%,start
And next, finally, Brooke.

00:03:23.603 --> 00:03:27.307 line:95%,end
Brooke, you're here because
you obviously didn't dance.

00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:30.310 line:95%,end
You had a nice little vacation.

00:03:30.376 --> 00:03:33.580 line:95%,end
MELISSA: That was no vacation, Abby.
It was more like a leave of absence.

00:03:33.646 --> 00:03:35.582 line:5%,start
You forced Brooke to take the week off,

00:03:35.648 --> 00:03:38.751 line:95%,end
and now you put her at the bottom
of the pyramid like it's her fault.

00:03:38.818 --> 00:03:41.421 line:95%,end
ABBY: Now, you see another picture.

00:03:45.358 --> 00:03:46.826 line:95%,end
MELISSA: There's an extra
person on the pyramid.

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:49.829 line:95%,end
I have no idea who this is, no clue.

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:51.965 line:95%,end
We have a new member of the team.

00:03:53.967 --> 00:03:58.871 line:95%,end
She made the commitment,
and now Asia will be joining

00:03:58.938 --> 00:04:00.940 line:95%,end
the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:04:01.007 --> 00:04:02.875 line:95%,end
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:03.443 --> 00:04:06.179 line:95%,end
JILL: She might be amazing.
It doesn't matter to me.


00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:10.350 line:95%,end
We really don't need another team member.
We don't need her.

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:13.820 line:95%,end
ABBY: She was a contestant
in the Ultimate Competition

00:04:13.886 --> 00:04:15.488 line:95%,end
that I judged this summer.

00:04:15.555 --> 00:04:19.792 line:95%,end
Her mother, she signed the same
contract that you guys signed.

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.861 line:95%,end
She is here for the duration.

00:04:22.562 --> 00:04:24.297 line:95%,end
She wants my tutelage.

00:04:24.364 --> 00:04:27.166 line:95%,end
I do not think there's enough
competition among you.

00:04:27.233 --> 00:04:31.204 line:95%,end
I don't think you challenge
each other enough.

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:33.339 line:95%,end
And I want to warn you,

00:04:34.807 --> 00:04:39.212 line:95%,end
I don't want to hear one word about
anybody chasing this woman out.

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:44.584 line:95%,end
Now we are going to...

00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:48.221 line:95%,end
Energy Dance in Highland, Michigan.

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:51.924 line:95%,end
And I know, for a fact,
that the Wicked Witch of the West

00:04:51.991 --> 00:04:55.028 line:95%,end
and her crappy little apples
are going to be there.

00:04:55.094 --> 00:04:59.799 line:95%,end
You are the reigning
National Winners for Energy Dance.

00:04:59.866 --> 00:05:04.370 line:95%,end
You cannot walk in there
this weekend any less.

00:05:04.871 --> 00:05:09.275 line:95%,end
That evil, conniving, purse swinging troll
is going to be there this weekend.

00:05:09.342 --> 00:05:13.012 line:95%,end
I want to send her home crying.
That's what she deserves.

00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:15.348 line:95%,end
We are doing a group routine.

00:05:15.415 --> 00:05:18.718 line:95%,end
And the title of the routine
is "Return to Grace."

00:05:18.785 --> 00:05:22.789 line:95%,end
This is a very mature routine.
It's about reincarnation.

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:27.327 line:95%,end
That group routine will
be without Mackenzie

00:05:27.393 --> 00:05:29.262 line:95%,end
and without Asia.

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:32.365 line:95%,end
This week's subject matter
is very serious.

00:05:32.432 --> 00:05:36.302 line:95%,end
So I'm going to let Mackenzie and Asia
both sit this one out.

00:05:36.369 --> 00:05:41.341 line:95%,end
With Mackenzie's foot being a little iffy,
and Asia's brand new to the team,

00:05:41.407 --> 00:05:43.943 line:95%,end
I don't need the two of them
screwing this number up.

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:47.046 line:95%,end
I have a trio.

00:05:48.514 --> 00:05:53.486 line:95%,end
And my trio is going to
Kendall, Maddie and Chloe.

00:05:53.553 --> 00:05:55.555 line:95%,end
[CHEERING]

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.592 line:95%,end
This is a jazz trio.

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:01.260 line:95%,end
It's high energy.

00:06:01.327 --> 00:06:04.030 line:95%,end
It's called "We Believe."

00:06:04.097 --> 00:06:08.668 line:95%,end
And I have one solo,
and that we'll be going to Asia.

00:06:09.802 --> 00:06:12.372 line:95%,end
And she will be competing
in the Mini Division.

00:06:12.438 --> 00:06:15.408 line:95%,end
Asia is a brand new student
here at the Abby Lee Dance Company,

00:06:15.475 --> 00:06:20.246 line:95%,end
so what better way to analyze her talent
than giving her a solo?

00:06:20.313 --> 00:06:24.183 line:95%,end
Ladies, spread apart.
We're gonna start on the left side today.

00:06:26.452 --> 00:06:29.455 line:95%,end
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:30.757 --> 00:06:33.292 line:5%,start
All right, girls, "Return to Grace."

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.765 line:5%,start
So you were sad, you had the blues,
it was down and out.

00:06:39.766 --> 00:06:42.535 line:95%,end
You come back, and everything is fabulous.

00:06:43.202 --> 00:06:45.104 line:95%,end
So where-- I want to
meet this new dance mom.

00:06:45.171 --> 00:06:48.508 line:95%,end
Don't worry.
I think your chance is coming.

00:06:48.574 --> 00:06:50.843 line:95%,end
Push, down, down. Yes.

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.346 line:95%,end
Everybody's here. Our team's in tact.

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:56.249 line:95%,end
I thought this was the team.
This was her dream team.

00:06:57.583 --> 00:06:59.452 line:95%,end
Roll. Hide.

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.756 line:95%,end
This week's group number
is about reincarnation,

00:07:03.823 --> 00:07:07.160 line:95%,end
about coming back better,
stronger than ever.

00:07:07.226 --> 00:07:10.863 line:95%,end
Coupe, rond de jombe. Run, run, jetÃ©.
Change directions.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:11.898 line:95%,end
Run, run.

00:07:11.964 --> 00:07:13.866 line:95%,end
This routine is going to say

00:07:13.933 --> 00:07:16.736 line:95%,end
we are the reigning national winners,

00:07:16.803 --> 00:07:19.672 line:95%,end
and those apple core boys
have nothing on us.

00:07:19.739 --> 00:07:22.108 line:95%,end
Does anybody believe in reincarnation?

00:07:22.642 --> 00:07:24.444 line:95%,end
I don't think I do. Do you, Holly?

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:27.680 line:95%,end
If we came back reincarnated,
what would you want to come back as?

00:07:27.747 --> 00:07:30.817 line:95%,end
I certainly wouldn't come back as a member
of the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:07:30.883 --> 00:07:32.885 line:95%,end
That's for sure.

00:07:32.952 --> 00:07:35.955 line:95%,end
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:38.157 --> 00:07:40.193 line:5%,start
CATHY: Hey, hey, hey, hey. Let's go.
Come on.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:43.129 line:5%,start
We lost, didn't we? We're number two.

00:07:43.196 --> 00:07:48.167 line:5%,start
We try harder, and I'm about tired
of having that is my motto.

00:07:48.234 --> 00:07:51.404 line:5%,start
After going against Abby
at the last competition,

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:53.005 line:5%,start
we are now one and two.

00:07:53.072 --> 00:07:55.842 line:5%,start
I'm going to have to continue
to evolve my group

00:07:55.908 --> 00:07:58.578 line:95%,end
to figure out how we consistently win.

00:07:58.644 --> 00:08:00.480 line:95%,end
Let's take a look at the pyramid.

00:08:00.546 --> 00:08:01.981 line:95%,end
We've got Brandon.

00:08:02.048 --> 00:08:07.153 line:95%,end
Brandon, you, to me,
are the well-rounded dancer.

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:11.591 line:95%,end
Next, Zack. You're my Zack Attack.
Zack is back.


00:08:11.657 --> 00:08:14.427 line:95%,end
Next, Gino.

00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:18.631 line:95%,end
You are my little fire and ice,
and I need you to keep it up.

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:22.869 line:95%,end
And at the top, Nick.

00:08:22.935 --> 00:08:25.771 line:95%,end
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:25.838 --> 00:08:28.541 line:95%,end
You're a newcomer,
but I was impressed with the skills

00:08:28.608 --> 00:08:31.611 line:95%,end
that I saw the last time that we competed.

00:08:31.677 --> 00:08:33.779 line:95%,end
With that being said, my choreographer,

00:08:33.846 --> 00:08:36.215 line:95%,end
which I want to introduce
him to you right now,

00:08:36.282 --> 00:08:41.220 line:95%,end
he was a Mr. Dance of America,

And he's just awesome. Everybody, here is
your choreographer for this week.

John.

00:08:49.695 --> 00:08:53.266 line:5%,start
My guest choreographer this week
is John Culbertson.

00:08:53.332 --> 00:08:58.905 line:95%,end
The funny thing about John, however,
is that he's very good friends with Abby.

00:08:58.971 --> 00:09:02.174 line:95%,end
This is going to rock Abby's world.

00:09:02.241 --> 00:09:03.843 line:95%,end
-We're here to win.
-Win!

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:06.646 line:95%,end
Did you hear that?
Win, that's the word of the week.

00:09:06.712 --> 00:09:10.049 line:95%,end
Dancers, go get warmed up.
John, go ahead and talk to them.

00:09:10.116 --> 00:09:11.884 line:95%,end
Thank you.

ABBY: Melissa!
MELISSA: Yeah?

00:09:18.591 --> 00:09:21.193 line:95%,end
-Hi, Ab. Good. How are you?
-Hey, how you doing? Good.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:25.631 line:95%,end
I know this whole thing with Baby...
maybe I'm a little crazy.

00:09:25.698 --> 00:09:30.102 line:95%,end
It's been a few weeks since Broadway Baby
got sick and passed away.

00:09:30.169 --> 00:09:32.371 line:95%,end
And I'm still dealing with it.

00:09:32.438 --> 00:09:35.408 line:95%,end
But people have had dogs,
you know, they-- their dog,

00:09:35.474 --> 00:09:37.777 line:95%,end
they-- they put it down
and then they get another one.

00:09:37.843 --> 00:09:39.779 line:95%,end
And I'm like, I just can't do that.

00:09:39.845 --> 00:09:41.247 line:95%,end
-There's no way.
-I'm with you.

00:09:41.314 --> 00:09:44.317 line:95%,end
So I'm still trying to figure out
what I'm going to do with Baby.

00:09:45.117 --> 00:09:48.688 line:95%,end
-But look at this baby doll.
MELISSA: Aw.

00:09:48.754 --> 00:09:52.458 line:95%,end
I mean, look at her. She looks like
a stuffed animal, doesn't she?

00:09:52.925 --> 00:09:56.128 line:95%,end
Isn't she so sweet?
And that eyes and her nose, and I--

00:09:56.195 --> 00:09:59.231 line:95%,end
You know, go to a reputable taxidermy
place...

00:10:01.334 --> 00:10:04.236 line:95%,end
ABBY: Maybe, just maybe,
I'll have a little bit of her

00:10:04.303 --> 00:10:06.339 line:95%,end
to carry with me wherever I go.

00:10:06.405 --> 00:10:09.742 line:95%,end
-Picture-- look how cute.
-She looks so cute.

00:10:09.809 --> 00:10:11.911 line:95%,end
Abby loved her dog.

00:10:11.978 --> 00:10:13.546 line:95%,end
And she's going to be able
to see her every day.

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:17.783 line:95%,end
Maybe some people think it's crazy,
but that's her baby.

00:10:20.019 --> 00:10:22.488 line:95%,end
What were you doing, Melissa?
What's going on?

00:10:22.555 --> 00:10:26.225 line:95%,end
Abby just wanted to tell me
what she's going to be doing with Baby.

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:28.995 line:95%,end
[CHRISTI GASPS]
What do you mean?

00:10:29.061 --> 00:10:32.098 line:95%,end
Abby's going to take her
to a-- a preservationist.

00:10:33.065 --> 00:10:35.501 line:95%,end
What the hell is that,
like, a taxidermy place?

00:10:35.568 --> 00:10:36.836 line:95%,end
Mm-hmm.

00:10:36.902 --> 00:10:39.205 line:95%,end
She is not going to stuff her dog.

00:10:40.072 --> 00:10:43.843 line:95%,end
[LAUGHS] The woman has lost--

00:10:43.909 --> 00:10:46.512 line:95%,end
Well, she needs something
to cuddle at night.

00:10:47.013 --> 00:10:49.181 line:95%,end
Looks like the ALDC has a new mascot,

00:10:49.248 --> 00:10:51.817 line:95%,end
and we'll carry it along to all
the competitions like, here you go.

00:10:51.884 --> 00:10:54.553 line:95%,end
Here's your lucky charm.
Give her head a rub.

00:10:56.222 --> 00:10:59.258 line:5%,start
Now, this is a jazz trio.

00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:02.495 line:95%,end
It's not contemporary. It's not lyrical.

00:11:02.561 --> 00:11:04.764 line:95%,end
It is high energy jazz.

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:09.468 line:95%,end
Your dance needs to be
as strong and as confident

00:11:09.535 --> 00:11:11.604 line:95%,end
at the very end as it is
at the very beginning.

00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:14.106 line:95%,end
We have a great jazz dance this week.

00:11:14.173 --> 00:11:15.875 line:95%,end
This is a clean, sharp routine.

00:11:15.941 --> 00:11:17.877 line:95%,end
It's like, leap, land, cut.

00:11:17.943 --> 00:11:20.913 line:95%,end
They're going to sizzle
in these hot orange costumes,

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.983 line:95%,end
and they're going to go out there and say,
we can do it all.

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:27.420 line:95%,end
Run, run, leap, through, strut. Go!

00:11:27.486 --> 00:11:30.056 line:95%,end
You're taking too long to get there.
Go, again.

00:11:30.122 --> 00:11:33.492 line:95%,end
Girls, I'll tell you what.
The boys are going to be there.

00:11:33.559 --> 00:11:36.095 line:95%,end
They're probably going to have
a duet or a trio against you.

00:11:36.162 --> 00:11:39.265 line:95%,end
Do you believe?
I'm not so sure I'm believing.

00:11:39.331 --> 00:11:42.601 line:95%,end
Everybody has to have the face,
and everybody has to have the what?

00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:45.304 line:95%,end
ABBY: Stamina. You're dismissed.

00:11:46.005 --> 00:11:49.942 line:95%,end
Well, I can imagine that Asia's gonna
be moving up the pyramid pretty quickly.

00:11:50.009 --> 00:11:53.012 line:95%,end
-I can guarantee that.
-I-- I have no idea who this kid is.

00:11:53.079 --> 00:11:55.481 line:95%,end
Oh, look. She's in a cage.

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:57.116 line:95%,end
KELLY: Oh, my god.
CHRISTI: Oh, my god.

00:11:57.183 --> 00:12:00.186 line:95%,end
MELISSA: She's, like a little wild animal
coming out of a cage.

00:12:00.252 --> 00:12:02.688 line:95%,end
She hasn't done a single leap or turn.

00:12:02.755 --> 00:12:05.224 line:95%,end
KELLY: I could tell that Melissa's
nervous about Asia.

00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:07.626 line:95%,end
I mean, Mackenzie and Asia
are the same size.

00:12:07.693 --> 00:12:09.795 line:95%,end
And with Mackenzie's foot bothering her,

00:12:09.862 --> 00:12:12.932 line:95%,end
maybe Abby's bringing Asia in
for a permanent replacement.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.808 line:95%,end
Who is ready to meet the new kid?

00:12:22.875 --> 00:12:24.677 line:95%,end
Kenzie is, I think.

00:12:26.879 --> 00:12:30.649 line:95%,end
Yeah. I'd like to meet her and see what
she's going to bring to our team.

00:12:30.716 --> 00:12:33.819 line:5%,start
I know the kids are looking
forward to meeting Asia.

00:12:33.886 --> 00:12:36.655 line:5%,start
But, to be honest with you,
I'm not really looking forward

00:12:36.722 --> 00:12:41.227 line:95%,end
to meeting Kristie. I don't believe we
need another new student and another mom.

-Hello!

00:12:44.263 --> 00:12:46.165 line:95%,end
How are you, sweetheart?

How are you? Ooh!

00:12:50.236 --> 00:12:53.105 line:95%,end
-Hello, Miss Abby. I'm great.
-And how are you?

00:12:53.172 --> 00:12:57.510 line:5%,start
I can't believe Asia and her mom, Kristie,
are actually here in my studio.

00:12:57.576 --> 00:12:59.712 line:5%,start
I am ready to work with Asia.

00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:01.947 line:5%,start
I hope she can handle my tough love.

Asia is so excited to be working with you.

We're here to work, right?

00:13:11.457 --> 00:13:14.160 line:5%,start
The girls are sweet as pie.

00:13:14.226 --> 00:13:20.166 line:95%,end
I'm hoping that you are here to follow
my rules, not to question me.

That's what the other mothers
are all about.

to train with Abby

00:13:25.404 --> 00:13:27.473 line:95%,end
because Asia wants to be here.

match up with Mackenzie.

Mackenzie is a smart little kid.

00:13:49.328 --> 00:13:53.632 line:95%,end
I think she's going to keep this new
lil' friend close and her enemies closer.

KELLY: I know deep down inside,
Melissa's nervous.

00:13:57.036 --> 00:13:58.571 line:5%,start
Here's this little girl comes in

00:13:58.637 --> 00:14:00.472 line:5%,start
and she's going out
and she's doing a solo this week.

00:14:00.539 --> 00:14:04.076 line:95%,end
Mackenzie is not even dancing this week.
She's not even in the group dance.

00:14:04.143 --> 00:14:07.279 line:95%,end
So you are not in the group dance.
Mackenzie is not in it, either.

00:14:07.346 --> 00:14:10.115 line:95%,end
It's a little bit of a more
mature subject matter.

00:14:10.182 --> 00:14:12.218 line:95%,end
You will be doing a solo, also.

00:14:12.284 --> 00:14:13.786 line:95%,end

ASIA: Yes.

00:14:13.853 --> 00:14:15.321 line:95%,end
You guys can get to know each other.

I can't imagine Abby
ever replacing Mackenzie.

00:14:18.357 --> 00:14:21.861 line:95%,end
But then I'm thinking, why is Asia here?
What is her purpose?

00:14:21.927 --> 00:14:25.164 line:95%,end
She has to have a purpose.
Why is she adding her to the team?

a successful weekend.

Drop. Boom. Dun, dun, dun.

You guys sure dished it out to me.
You better dish it out.

The moms gave me such a hard time
when I came to ALDC.

00:15:24.823 --> 00:15:29.561 line:95%,end
They had better give Kristie just the same
amount of trouble they gave me.

-Can I sit right here?
MELISSA: Yeah. Sure.

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:33.599 line:95%,end
MELISSA: We need to hide
your skinniness amongst us.

and that role has been filled.

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:47.046 line:95%,end
-So when did you get into town?
KRISTIE: This morning.

00:15:47.112 --> 00:15:49.949 line:95%,end
-Oh, gosh, you just got in.
-And-- but we just came from Korea.

00:15:50.015 --> 00:15:51.383 line:95%,end
-But I had to stop--
-You were in Korea?

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:53.953 line:95%,end
Yeah. Asia's been working in Korea.
She was on a TV show.

00:15:54.019 --> 00:15:58.590 line:95%,end
She got booked out so much, that there
was no way that she could compete.

-For jobs.

of Abby's caliber in your area?

KRISTIE: You know what?
I think her and Abby bonded.

00:16:09.735 --> 00:16:11.804 line:95%,end
And Asia loves Abby.

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:15.040 line:95%,end
And she works better with teachers
that are on her,

00:16:15.107 --> 00:16:18.644 line:95%,end

00:16:18.711 --> 00:16:20.679 line:95%,end
And so we're here.

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:24.116 line:95%,end
You guys moved to Pittsburgh,
which is great.

00:16:24.183 --> 00:16:28.120 line:95%,end

no high tailing it out for other jobs.

in the United States.

yucky weather.

you owe her $100,000 cash.

that I'm not intimidated,

And, honey, she can rock it out.

00:16:58.117 --> 00:17:01.720 line:95%,end
But can she straighten her legs
and point her feet? We'll have to see.

00:17:01.787 --> 00:17:05.024 line:95%,end
Watch me. Hit that, hit that.

Ding!

00:17:06.125 --> 00:17:08.794 line:95%,end

00:17:13.532 --> 00:17:17.069 line:95%,end
Your feet are so sickled,
your knees are knocking.

Crawl, crawl, ding!

00:17:19.304 --> 00:17:22.541 line:95%,end
Asia it's like dynamite
exploding on stage.

00:17:22.608 --> 00:17:25.144 line:95%,end
And I want her to scale it back a bit.

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:30.049 line:95%,end
So, Asia, I want to see cute,
I want to see fluffy,

MELISSA: Is this her style, this sassy--

00:17:34.219 --> 00:17:37.022 line:95%,end
Yeah. She's a more of a fierce dancer.
She's never been a cutesy dancer.

00:17:37.089 --> 00:17:40.125 line:95%,end
You have one more day to work on this,
and that's it.

00:17:40.926 --> 00:17:42.795 line:95%,end
You have to learn your solos in the day.

That's what we do
at the Abby Lee Dance Company.

She really is cute.

watch out.

Melissa having boobs--

What was your overall impression
of these mothers. Do tell.

00:18:20.999 --> 00:18:25.471 line:95%,end
Being around them now for this short time,
there's so many complaints.

Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum--
they're miserable.

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:31.877 line:95%,end
You know, I'm open to any questions,
and I didn't have a problem with them.

00:18:31.944 --> 00:18:34.947 line:95%,end
But I did feel that
they had the most questions.

make you nervous at all that,

want Kenzie to do the group.

in someone that's her age

and then leaves her at home?

00:21:37.496 --> 00:21:39.765 line:95%,end
MELISSA: No, not at all.
KRISTIE: So is that a--

00:21:40.799 --> 00:21:43.368 line:95%,end
Is that an ongoing injury?

00:21:43.435 --> 00:21:44.870 line:95%,end

It just happened a couple weeks ago.

when Sophia was here,

00:21:46.905 --> 00:21:49.007 line:95%,end
if Abby would've told you
to leave Maddie at home,

00:21:49.074 --> 00:21:50.008 line:95%,end

I just know you, and I know
that you would have never

let Maddie stay at home.
- No.

00:21:55.247 --> 00:21:56.648 line:95%,end
But they're two different people.

Maddie would've never
wanted to let her team--

You know?

time for people like that in my life.

I'm sorry, but you-- you
don't even know the beginning.

she left the room.
