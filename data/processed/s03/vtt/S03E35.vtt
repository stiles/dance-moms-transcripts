00:00:01.101 --> 00:00:02.802 line:5%,start
ABBY (VOICEOVER):
Previously on "Dance Moms."

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:04.270 line:5%,start
My mother comes first.

00:00:04.337 --> 00:00:05.839 line:5%,start
Thought you'd sneak in while I was away.

00:00:05.905 --> 00:00:08.875 line:5%,start
You two will be doing
solos every single week.

00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:10.310 line:5%,start
Tiana, where's Abby.

00:00:10.377 --> 00:00:11.778 line:5%,start
I'm sorry, Zack is amazing.

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:13.046 line:5%,start
Chloe's better technically.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.815 line:5%,start
ANNOUNCER:
And you're highest scoring elite

00:00:15.882 --> 00:00:19.886 line:5%,start
junior small group is act
number 38, "Black and Blue."

00:00:21.755 --> 00:00:24.691 line:5%,start
I think Abby would have been
proud of the performances.

00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:27.727 line:5%,start
You don't know what Abby would say.
She wasn't here.

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:29.829 line:5%,start
ABBY (VOICEOVER):
Coming up on "Dance Moms."

00:00:29.896 --> 00:00:34.234 line:5%,start
You are in one of the world's
best places for entertainment.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.969 line:5%,start
Don't be shy.
Don't be nervous.

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:38.705 line:5%,start
Just act like you're
talking to your friends.

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:39.939 line:5%,start
I can't breathe.

00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:41.808 line:5%,start
- You OK?
- I can't breathe.

00:00:42.342 --> 00:00:44.310 line:5%,start
Can't get nervous.
Don't get nervous.

00:00:44.411 --> 00:00:46.713 line:5%,start
Listen, do it for you.
Don't do it for her.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.151 line:5%,start
ABBY: Kelly, you have driven the wedge
between your children and myself.

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:52.752 line:5%,start
- No, Abby.
- Yes.

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:54.721 line:5%,start
I would never allow this to happen.

00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:57.457 line:5%,start
It's not me.

00:01:00.427 --> 00:01:01.828 line:95%,end
THEME SONG: Get up.

00:01:01.961 --> 00:01:03.797 line:95%,end
Get on the floor.

00:01:03.863 --> 00:01:06.766 line:95%,end
My world is with my girls.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.735 line:95%,end
Living on the dance floor.

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:15.108 line:95%,end
ABBY: Vegas, baby.
I love Las Vegas.

00:01:15.341 --> 00:01:18.211 line:95%,end
You either hit the jackpot or you lose.

00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:22.215 line:5%,start
And there's lots of studios here
that are going to join us at Nationals.

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:26.219 line:5%,start
So I want to set the bar high
and let them know

00:01:26.352 --> 00:01:28.888 line:5%,start
that the Abby Lee Dance Company
came to win.

00:01:28.955 --> 00:01:32.425 line:95%,end
She can do the cartwheel cut split,
the jump split, the whole deal.

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.594 line:95%,end
Now--
- Hello.

00:01:34.727 --> 00:01:35.995 line:95%,end
What's happening?

00:01:36.062 --> 00:01:37.897 line:95%,end
We haven't even started the pyramid yet,

00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:40.900 line:95%,end
and already those moms
are marching in here ready

00:01:40.967 --> 00:01:42.235 line:95%,end
to attack me.

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:44.370 line:95%,end
So there are concerns again.
So we're here.

00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:45.705 line:95%,end
And you guys--

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:46.973 line:95%,end
What are they concerned about?

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:49.709 line:95%,end
They didn't get the right answer
why you weren't at competition.

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:50.944 line:5%,start
Oh.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.745 line:5%,start
Abby keeps leaving us in the lurch.

00:01:52.812 --> 00:01:56.049 line:5%,start
We need to know if she
is committed to this team

00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:59.152 line:5%,start
and will be there at Nationals
for us and the girls.

00:01:59.552 --> 00:02:03.823 line:95%,end
After we were in Lancaster, Pennsylvania

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:10.029 line:95%,end
and I had to deal with Cathy,
I can no longer put myself

00:02:10.096 --> 00:02:13.032 line:95%,end
in a position to behave badly.

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.168 line:95%,end
And I think, do I go to this place

00:02:15.735 --> 00:02:18.972 line:95%,end
where these horrible people
are doing everything they can

00:02:19.038 --> 00:02:22.842 line:95%,end
to bring me down
and to make me lose my cool,

00:02:23.443 --> 00:02:25.912 line:95%,end
when Kelly you showed up in Orlando.

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:28.948 line:95%,end
And I was sitting in a seat
watching the competition.

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:33.319 line:95%,end
When the two of three judges,
looked over at me

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.522 line:95%,end
and saw the spectacle.

00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:37.157 line:95%,end
You wouldn't have made a spectacle

00:02:37.223 --> 00:02:38.758 line:95%,end
if you would have just let me sit down.

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:40.627 line:95%,end
I didn't want to make a spectacle.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.629 line:95%,end
- Well, you did.
- No, you did.

00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:44.030 line:95%,end
Because you wouldn't move.

00:02:44.097 --> 00:02:46.699 line:95%,end
I don't have to move, Kelly.
There were 1,000 seats.

00:02:46.766 --> 00:02:48.635 line:95%,end
And I didn't have to
find another seat, Abby.

00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:49.769 line:95%,end
You should never have to ask me--

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:52.105 line:95%,end
Why is it OK that
you don't have to do things and I do?

00:02:53.773 --> 00:02:56.809 line:95%,end
Who made you like Princess Abby?

00:02:56.876 --> 00:02:59.078 line:95%,end
Abby Lee Dance Company. It's all about me.

00:02:59.145 --> 00:03:01.748 line:95%,end
Yeah, well we weren't
at Abby Lee Dance Company. We were at--

00:03:01.814 --> 00:03:04.717 line:95%,end
It was the Abby Lee Dance Company
attending a competition.

00:03:04.784 --> 00:03:07.654 line:95%,end
The way you didn't want Kathy
to treat you and talk to you

00:03:07.787 --> 00:03:09.889 line:95%,end
is the reason why
I wasn't here for those two weeks.

00:03:09.956 --> 00:03:12.258 line:95%,end
Cathy doesn't bother me at all.

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:18.731 line:95%,end
It was my behavior reacting to Cathy

00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:20.934 line:95%,end
and reacting to you and reacting to--

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.235 line:95%,end
And what I'm telling you is--

00:03:22.302 --> 00:03:23.937 line:95%,end
--all the idiots in the world.

00:03:24.003 --> 00:03:27.640 line:95%,end
And I'm a professional
and I will remain a professional.

00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:29.576 line:95%,end
And that's the way it goes.

00:03:29.642 --> 00:03:32.178 line:95%,end
I don't owe anyone an explanation.

00:03:32.245 --> 00:03:33.713 line:95%,end
What's past is past.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.983 line:95%,end
I need to worry about the future
and the road to Nationals.

00:03:37.183 --> 00:03:39.919 line:95%,end
I need the girls to get in here
and start rehearsal.

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.757 line:95%,end
You are in one of the world's
best places for entertainment.

00:03:44.824 --> 00:03:49.195 line:95%,end
There are more shows employing
more dancers than on Broadway right now.

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:51.864 line:95%,end
Last week, you had a big win.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.502 line:95%,end
I love the routine Black and Blue.

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.073 line:95%,end
And although I wasn't present
for the competition, you told the story.

00:04:00.173 --> 00:04:02.308 line:95%,end
Everybody saw it.
Everybody got it.

00:04:02.375 --> 00:04:04.677 line:95%,end
Abby I have a quick question
before you get to the pyramid.

00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:08.081 line:95%,end
Just in general, how did you go
about creating a pyramid

00:04:08.147 --> 00:04:10.049 line:95%,end
since you weren't
at the last two competitions?

00:04:10.116 --> 00:04:12.418 line:95%,end
Well I know the results of
the last two competitions.

00:04:12.485 --> 00:04:13.987 line:95%,end
We get the score sheets
from every competition

00:04:14.053 --> 00:04:15.455 line:95%,end
and the comment sheets.

00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:18.791 line:95%,end
So I obviously know how everyone did.

00:04:18.891 --> 00:04:22.462 line:95%,end
But last week I was in rehearsal.
I worked on the numbers.


00:04:22.528 --> 00:04:25.231 line:5%,start
I do not believe
the excuse Abby's giving us

00:04:25.298 --> 00:04:27.300 line:5%,start
for why she was away.
But you know what?

00:04:27.467 --> 00:04:29.802 line:95%,end
She's here now
and Nationals is two weeks away

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:33.339 line:95%,end
and we just need to focus on that
and winning and move on.

00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:42.115 line:95%,end
Page until you start to improve
a big amount in the technical area,

00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:44.517 line:95%,end
you're not going to be
moving up that pyramid.

00:04:46.185 --> 00:04:48.855 line:95%,end
And next, Brooke.

00:04:49.656 --> 00:04:51.958 line:95%,end
Brooke, you did a solo in Ohio.

00:04:52.492 --> 00:04:53.726 line:95%,end
You were fourth.

00:04:54.193 --> 00:04:55.428 line:95%,end
You never used to be fourth.

00:04:55.495 --> 00:04:58.831 line:95%,end
Last year going into Nationals,
you were really strong.

00:04:58.898 --> 00:05:00.833 line:95%,end
You won a national title.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.603 line:95%,end
As of today's date,
you're still holding on to that title.

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.205 line:95%,end
I think you should go back
and look at the choreography

00:05:06.272 --> 00:05:08.508 line:95%,end
from that dance that she did at title

00:05:08.574 --> 00:05:10.843 line:95%,end
and then go back and look
at her choreography in Ohio

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.246 line:95%,end
and compare the two.
And that's why she got fourth.

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:18.117 line:95%,end
Kelly always has some lame excuse
on why her kids don't win.

00:05:18.251 --> 00:05:19.385 line:95%,end
Well you know what, Kelly?

00:05:19.452 --> 00:05:24.524 line:95%,end
It's time that you and your kids
own up to your own losses.

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:25.992 line:95%,end
Next, we have Nia.

00:05:26.793 --> 00:05:30.430 line:95%,end
Now Nia, it's almost like
your mind wants it and it's there,

00:05:30.496 --> 00:05:35.001 line:95%,end
but your body isn't listening yet.
It's not fixing the problems itself.

00:05:35.368 --> 00:05:37.704 line:95%,end
So my advice is keep doing
what you're doing

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.772 line:95%,end
and someday it's going to click.

00:05:39.972 --> 00:05:43.409 line:95%,end
So she shouldn't be discouraged
that she's at the bottom of the pyramid.

00:05:43.476 --> 00:05:45.445 line:95%,end
No, it's just--
it's going to take more work.

00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:47.880 line:95%,end
- OK.
- Whatever you're doing, double it.

00:05:49.882 --> 00:05:51.451 line:95%,end
And next we have Kendall.

00:05:52.151 --> 00:05:54.020 line:95%,end
Kendall, you're inconsistent.

00:05:54.087 --> 00:05:59.425 line:95%,end
Your facial expressions
and your emotion and just your intensity

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:03.262 line:95%,end
is so much better in class,
in rehearsal, than it is on stage.

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:05.465 line:95%,end
I don't know what's going to happen
with you about Nationals.

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:09.869 line:95%,end
This is really a hard place
for me to be as a mom.

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:13.206 line:95%,end
I know that Kendall performs
better in the studio

00:06:13.306 --> 00:06:14.774 line:95%,end
than she does on stage.

00:06:14.841 --> 00:06:18.144 line:95%,end
All the more reason for Abby
to give Kendall more solos.

00:06:18.244 --> 00:06:21.381 line:95%,end
And next we have Mackenzie.

00:06:21.814 --> 00:06:23.116 line:95%,end
She is not here this week.

00:06:23.182 --> 00:06:24.984 line:95%,end
She needs to learn,

00:06:25.351 --> 00:06:27.587 line:95%,end
there are consequences for your actions

00:06:28.087 --> 00:06:31.023 line:95%,end
Mackenzie has made too
many careless mistakes.

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:34.494 line:95%,end
Now I realize that the duet won last week.

00:06:34.994 --> 00:06:37.764 line:95%,end
But it doesn't matter.
All eyes were on Asia.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.066 line:95%,end
That's why I'm sitting
Mackenzie out this week.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.736 line:95%,end
She needs to learn that this is
not a shoo in

00:06:44.137 --> 00:06:46.572 line:95%,end
because her older sister is Maddie.

00:06:47.373 --> 00:06:49.142 line:5%,start
I think Abby's picking on Mackenzie

00:06:49.208 --> 00:06:51.444 line:5%,start
because Nationals is just
right around the corner

00:06:51.511 --> 00:06:53.379 line:5%,start
and she really wants Mackenzie to compete.

00:06:53.446 --> 00:06:55.948 line:95%,end
This is two weeks before Nationals.

00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:58.484 line:95%,end
I don't need sloppy mistakes.

00:06:59.585 --> 00:07:01.687 line:95%,end
And next we have Asia.

00:07:01.788 --> 00:07:04.290 line:95%,end
You and Mackenzie won
the overall high score duet.

00:07:05.124 --> 00:07:07.226 line:95%,end
Kristie, Asia is improving.

00:07:07.627 --> 00:07:08.961 line:5%,start
I think so.

00:07:09.128 --> 00:07:11.097 line:5%,start
And we have Maddie.

00:07:12.398 --> 00:07:14.801 line:95%,end
Maddie, you could be on
the top of the pyramid

00:07:14.867 --> 00:07:16.836 line:95%,end
every single time, outstanding.

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.505 line:95%,end
What is next for you?

00:07:19.572 --> 00:07:22.408 line:95%,end
We all know that Maddie
is a phenomenal dancer.

00:07:22.475 --> 00:07:25.945 line:95%,end
But she needs to start setting
her goals a little higher.

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:28.714 line:95%,end
I want to see her work towards the future.

00:07:28.781 --> 00:07:32.819 line:95%,end
And on the top of the pyramid,
congratulations to Chloe.

00:07:32.985 --> 00:07:34.854 line:95%,end
[clapping]

00:07:36.522 --> 00:07:38.724 line:95%,end
Chloe, I know it was only 3/10 of a point.

00:07:39.692 --> 00:07:43.262 line:95%,end
It could've been 1/10 of a point.
It doesn't matter. You beat Zack.

00:07:43.329 --> 00:07:45.698 line:95%,end
And your highest scoring
elite junior soloist

00:07:45.798 --> 00:07:47.400 line:95%,end
is Chloe with act number 22.

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:48.468 line:95%,end
[cheering]

00:07:48.568 --> 00:07:49.969 line:5%,start
I think more than anything Chloe

00:07:50.036 --> 00:07:52.572 line:5%,start
being on top of the pyramid
means something to her

00:07:52.672 --> 00:07:56.509 line:5%,start
and she needs to know that
she really is a good dancer.

00:07:56.609 --> 00:07:58.578 line:5%,start
And this shows her that.

00:07:58.644 --> 00:08:01.948 line:95%,end
We will be attending
powerhouse dance competition.

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:05.351 line:95%,end
Asia, you will be doing a solo.

00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:09.589 line:95%,end
You are my best bet for Nationals.

00:08:09.655 --> 00:08:11.190 line:95%,end
I will be watching you closely.

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:12.959 line:95%,end
Kendall, you also have a solo.

00:08:13.926 --> 00:08:16.462 line:95%,end
Now Kendall, you have not been consistent.

00:08:16.929 --> 00:08:18.698 line:95%,end
This is your last shot.

00:08:18.764 --> 00:08:21.934 line:95%,end
If Abby gives Kendall more
of these solo opportunities,

00:08:22.001 --> 00:08:26.205 line:95%,end
than Kendall will become the front runner
and possibly win at Nationals.

00:08:26.272 --> 00:08:30.910 line:95%,end
This is your audition to see
if you will be dancing at Nationals.

00:08:31.777 --> 00:08:32.945 line:95%,end
Don't blow it.

00:08:33.012 --> 00:08:37.550 line:95%,end
Brooke and Paige, you also have solos.

00:08:39.785 --> 00:08:41.521 line:95%,end
I'm giving Brooke his solo this week

00:08:41.587 --> 00:08:44.257 line:95%,end
because she is our reigning
national champion.

00:08:44.457 --> 00:08:46.826 line:95%,end
And I wanted her to go
to Nationals again this year.


00:08:46.893 --> 00:08:50.229 line:95%,end
And with both girls dancing,
Kelly might be just

00:08:50.296 --> 00:08:53.132 line:95%,end
a little too busy
to get up at my business.

00:08:53.432 --> 00:08:56.869 line:95%,end
You will work every week.

00:08:56.936 --> 00:08:59.005 line:95%,end
Don't get me wrong, I'm totally happy

00:08:59.071 --> 00:09:00.873 line:95%,end
that Kelly and her kids
have solos this week.

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:02.775 line:95%,end
I mean, the kids never have a solo.

00:09:02.975 --> 00:09:06.412 line:95%,end
But I think it's kind of weird
that Chloe's at the top of the pyramid

00:09:06.612 --> 00:09:08.581 line:95%,end
and she doesn't have a solo.

00:09:08.648 --> 00:09:11.751 line:95%,end
Is this part of Abby's grand
plan to phase Chloe out?

00:09:12.885 --> 00:09:16.422 line:95%,end
Brooke and Paige, not too many teachers
want to work with you,

00:09:16.589 --> 00:09:18.457 line:95%,end
especially not from
the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:09:18.658 --> 00:09:20.960 line:95%,end
I'm finished choreographing
Brooke and Paige's solo.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.397 line:95%,end
Their mother has been
so disrespectful to me

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:28.167 line:95%,end
as a teacher, as a choreographer, as a
studio director,

00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:30.269 line:95%,end
let somebody else do it.

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:34.206 line:95%,end
Me, as well as
the rest of my staff members

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.643 line:95%,end
are finished with her and her kids.

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:41.247 line:95%,end
So I have a colleague, Ricky Palomino,

00:09:41.314 --> 00:09:44.016 line:95%,end
will be choreographing both of your solos.

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:46.852 line:95%,end
You can blame the choreographer
a million times,

00:09:47.086 --> 00:09:49.956 line:95%,end
but ultimately,
you're the one on the stage.

00:09:50.022 --> 00:09:52.858 line:95%,end
You know it's so sad
that my kids' mentor

00:09:52.925 --> 00:09:56.195 line:95%,end
cares so little about them that
she's going to hire a choreographer

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:59.432 line:95%,end
to come in and teach them their dance,
because she doesn't have time for them.

00:09:59.498 --> 00:10:04.136 line:95%,end
The group routine is historical Las Vegas.

00:10:04.203 --> 00:10:08.741 line:95%,end
When I think of Vegas,
I think of the Rat Pack.

00:10:08.808 --> 00:10:13.279 line:95%,end
They were cool. They were smooth.
They were entertainers.

00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:15.214 line:95%,end
And that's what you're going to do.

00:10:15.581 --> 00:10:19.652 line:95%,end
Asia, you will not be performing
with the group routine.

00:10:20.086 --> 00:10:23.322 line:95%,end
However, you will be rehearsing,
you will be learning,

00:10:23.389 --> 00:10:26.592 line:95%,end
and you will be swinging.
You understand that? Yes.

00:10:26.792 --> 00:10:28.761 line:95%,end
So with Mackenzie out, Asia's out too.

00:10:28.828 --> 00:10:31.297 line:95%,end
It's more important for her
to improve her technique

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:33.332 line:95%,end
and get better every single week.

00:10:33.566 --> 00:10:37.837 line:95%,end
If you don't pull your weight
and you don't pick up, you're out.

00:10:38.371 --> 00:10:40.172 line:95%,end
I am not putting up with it.

00:10:40.272 --> 00:10:42.041 line:95%,end
I am not watering things down

00:10:42.174 --> 00:10:44.477 line:95%,end
because one or two or three
people can do it.

00:10:45.011 --> 00:10:46.846 line:95%,end
Those days are over.

00:10:47.079 --> 00:10:50.850 line:95%,end
All right. So moms, you can have a seat
outside in the waiting area.

00:10:50.916 --> 00:10:53.119 line:95%,end
And girls spread apart.
Let's stretch out.

00:10:58.724 --> 00:11:02.328 line:95%,end
You're boys. It's smooth. It's cool.

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:07.099 line:95%,end
They were cool.
Everybody wanted to be like them.

00:11:07.266 --> 00:11:11.370 line:95%,end
They had swag.
They were slick.

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:13.773 line:95%,end
I'm really excited
about the group routine.

00:11:13.839 --> 00:11:18.044 line:5%,start
We're doing The Brat Pack
and it's to pay homage

00:11:18.144 --> 00:11:20.279 line:5%,start
to the original Rat Pack.

00:11:20.346 --> 00:11:24.283 line:95%,end
Now the girls, they need
to be cool, not cute.

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:27.787 line:95%,end
Give me a contracted
over West Side Story,

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:31.991 line:95%,end
Jerome Robbins, knee, knee, jump.
No, big, high.

00:11:32.058 --> 00:11:33.426 line:95%,end
Da, da, da.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.128 line:95%,end
Smile!

00:11:38.197 --> 00:11:40.766 line:95%,end
I think this is exciting
because no one is going to expect

00:11:40.833 --> 00:11:42.668 line:95%,end
that these girls,
these beautiful little girls

00:11:42.735 --> 00:11:44.570 line:95%,end
are be dressed up as men.

00:11:45.571 --> 00:11:47.440 line:95%,end
You're a guy!

00:11:48.574 --> 00:11:50.042 line:95%,end
Nia, think!

00:11:56.882 --> 00:11:58.918 line:95%,end
All right, girls.
Looking good, looking good.

00:11:58.984 --> 00:12:00.352 line:95%,end
You're looking like the
Rat Pack a little bit.

00:12:00.419 --> 00:12:02.555 line:95%,end
No sun. No fun.

00:12:03.422 --> 00:12:05.458 line:95%,end
No chlorine.
No swimming.

00:12:05.524 --> 00:12:08.160 line:95%,end
Yes? Watch the cracks
and stuff on the sidewalk.

00:12:08.227 --> 00:12:10.463 line:95%,end
Remember, step on a crack
break your mother's back.

00:12:11.197 --> 00:12:13.766 line:95%,end
Did you smoke one before you came on here?

00:12:14.066 --> 00:12:15.301 line:95%,end
Hello.

00:12:17.036 --> 00:12:18.237 line:5%,start
I'm good.
How are you?

00:12:18.304 --> 00:12:20.439 line:95%,end
I just got a phone call
from Brooke's music producer

00:12:20.506 --> 00:12:22.308 line:95%,end
saying that Brooke has
been asked to do

00:12:22.374 --> 00:12:23.709 line:95%,end
a local TV show here.

00:12:27.513 --> 00:12:30.149 line:95%,end
I often wonder
why I keep my kids on this team

00:12:30.382 --> 00:12:32.384 line:95%,end
and this is why.

00:12:32.451 --> 00:12:35.921 line:95%,end
Brooke is getting exposure
just traveling with the team to Vegas.

00:12:35.988 --> 00:12:37.923 line:95%,end
Thank you. Bye-bye.

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:43.896 line:95%,end
KVVU TV wants Brooke to come
and sing and talk about her album

00:12:43.996 --> 00:12:45.231 line:95%,end
on her show tomorrow at 12:30.

00:12:45.297 --> 00:12:49.468 line:95%,end
- Here locally?
- Oh, congratulations.

00:12:50.136 --> 00:12:52.538 line:95%,end
I know, but we'll have to miss practice.

00:12:52.838 --> 00:12:55.941 line:95%,end
I know Abby's going to be furious
if we miss rehearsal.

00:12:56.142 --> 00:12:59.945 line:95%,end
But it's a great opportunity for her
and it makes it all worth it.

00:13:00.012 --> 00:13:01.347 line:95%,end
Sometimes you have to take a risk.

00:13:01.413 --> 00:13:03.115 line:95%,end
And here you are in Vegas.
You get this opportunity.

00:13:03.182 --> 00:13:04.717 line:95%,end
Take a gamble.


00:13:20.866 --> 00:13:22.268 line:95%,end
This is an important week.

00:13:22.334 --> 00:13:25.604 line:95%,end
I'm deciding who's going
to do a solo at Nationals.

00:13:25.671 --> 00:13:27.106 line:95%,end
I brought in a choreographer.

00:13:27.173 --> 00:13:32.645 line:5%,start
His name's Ricky. I think that the girls
will really work well with him.

00:13:32.711 --> 00:13:35.548 line:95%,end
The contemporary piece that
Ricky has chosen for Paige

00:13:35.714 --> 00:13:37.850 line:95%,end
is entitled "one."

00:13:43.122 --> 00:13:45.457 line:95%,end
This is Paige's first solo in a long time.

00:13:45.558 --> 00:13:48.160 line:95%,end
By the looks of this.
She has a long way to go.

00:13:52.331 --> 00:13:54.033 line:95%,end
Boom.
Oh, sorry.

00:13:54.133 --> 00:13:56.902 line:95%,end
When you come up, it goes bevel.
Close that.

00:13:57.303 --> 00:13:59.939 line:95%,end
ABBY: That's the end?
- It is.

00:14:00.005 --> 00:14:04.877 line:95%,end
I have like a $350 costume
basic without stones yet.

00:14:05.277 --> 00:14:09.014 line:95%,end
So probably upwards of
$500 being made for her.

00:14:11.517 --> 00:14:15.421 line:95%,end
I'm excited to have a solo but I've
never really worked with Ricky before.

00:14:16.222 --> 00:14:18.657 line:5%,start
He's really nice
and choreography is great.

00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:21.260 line:5%,start
But it's still all new to me,
so I'm a little bit nervous

00:14:21.327 --> 00:14:22.561 line:5%,start
of how it's going to turn out.

00:14:22.628 --> 00:14:24.196 line:95%,end
Thank you.
- Absolutely.

00:14:24.296 --> 00:14:25.664 line:95%,end
I'll see you later, Kelly.
- OK.

00:14:28.234 --> 00:14:29.602 line:95%,end
Hey How's it going?

00:14:30.536 --> 00:14:32.438 line:95%,end
- We finished the dance.
- Oh, good.

00:14:32.504 --> 00:14:35.307 line:95%,end
And he said, just focus on your dance.
Don't worry about it.

00:14:35.507 --> 00:14:37.076 line:95%,end
- Isn't that nice?
HOLLY: I can't wait to see this.

00:14:37.142 --> 00:14:39.011 line:95%,end
It's a lot easier to learn,
because instead of

00:14:39.111 --> 00:14:41.580 line:95%,end
doing something wrong,
he won't be like, you're stupid.

00:14:41.714 --> 00:14:43.315 line:95%,end
When he does something wrong,
he's like this.

00:14:43.415 --> 00:14:45.417 line:95%,end
And then when I do it right,
he's like, great job, Paige.

00:14:45.484 --> 00:14:47.253 line:95%,end
Positive. Positive.

00:14:47.319 --> 00:14:48.921 line:95%,end
OK. Go in the other room and watch.

00:14:48.988 --> 00:14:52.024 line:95%,end
Ricky and Abby are totally
different types of teachers.

00:14:52.324 --> 00:14:54.693 line:95%,end
Paige, you were given an opportunity

00:14:55.027 --> 00:14:58.464 line:95%,end
and instead of running with it,
it was mediocre.

00:14:58.530 --> 00:14:59.865 line:95%,end
Don't look at your mother.

00:14:59.965 --> 00:15:02.301 line:95%,end
Every time you look at your mother,
you get 20 pushups.

00:15:03.135 --> 00:15:05.704 line:95%,end
Paige.
What were you doing out there?

00:15:06.372 --> 00:15:07.606 line:95%,end
[chair slams]

00:15:07.706 --> 00:15:09.775 line:95%,end
Done!
Next.

00:15:10.609 --> 00:15:12.011 line:95%,end
No solo.

00:15:12.745 --> 00:15:15.381 line:5%,start
I just think back and I can't
even remember the last time

00:15:15.447 --> 00:15:18.050 line:5%,start
that Paige smiled during
one of Abby's dances.

00:15:18.417 --> 00:15:19.585 line:5%,start
She makes her miserable.

00:15:19.652 --> 00:15:21.220 line:5%,start
Let's do it.
Full out.

00:15:23.589 --> 00:15:25.224 line:5%,start
Keep it easy.
No hopping.

00:15:26.959 --> 00:15:30.062 line:95%,end
Come on, Brooke, a little bit more like.
Let us see in your eyes.

00:15:30.396 --> 00:15:33.198 line:95%,end
Brooke's solo is
entitled "Now is my Time."

00:15:33.832 --> 00:15:38.237 line:95%,end
Ricky does great leg extensions,
beautiful movements,

00:15:38.304 --> 00:15:40.205 line:95%,end
lots of changes of direction.

00:15:40.673 --> 00:15:42.574 line:95%,end
This is a challenge for Brooke.

00:15:42.641 --> 00:15:44.944 line:95%,end
That's what we want
right before Nationals.

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:49.114 line:95%,end
So you can step all
the way through to go ah!

00:15:50.816 --> 00:15:51.884 line:95%,end
Cool?

00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:54.019 line:95%,end
I feel like I'm making you
nervous or something.

00:15:54.253 --> 00:15:55.321 line:95%,end
You know what I mean?

00:15:55.454 --> 00:15:58.123 line:95%,end
Go back to that place,
like try to give yourself chills.

00:15:58.190 --> 00:15:59.959 line:95%,end
Like now is my time.

00:16:00.626 --> 00:16:03.796 line:95%,end
Like this is-- this is like
a point of like, like, hiding

00:16:04.063 --> 00:16:05.531 line:95%,end
but then like releasing.

00:16:07.766 --> 00:16:09.268 line:95%,end
This is a big week for me.

00:16:09.501 --> 00:16:12.338 line:5%,start
I not only have solo and group,

00:16:12.504 --> 00:16:15.708 line:5%,start
I also have a TV interview
so it's a lot of pressure

00:16:15.774 --> 00:16:17.176 line:5%,start
and I'm really stressed out.

00:16:18.077 --> 00:16:19.712 line:95%,end
Emotion, Brooke.

00:16:22.815 --> 00:16:24.883 line:95%,end
Try to give yourself chills.

00:16:25.084 --> 00:16:28.253 line:95%,end
Abby and I used to be really close,
but we're not anymore.

00:16:28.454 --> 00:16:32.925 line:95%,end
So maybe by me having a solo,
we can come in a better place.

00:16:32.992 --> 00:16:36.228 line:95%,end
And it's definitely not Ricky
that's making me nervous.


00:16:37.062 --> 00:16:39.465 line:95%,end
Just try to get emotional with it,
like right off the bat.

00:16:39.598 --> 00:16:41.767 line:95%,end
You know what I mean?
Like this is your time.

00:16:41.834 --> 00:16:43.702 line:95%,end
I feel like you're like
at a pivotal time in your life.

00:16:43.802 --> 00:16:45.938 line:95%,end
Like, you're becoming a woman.

00:16:46.005 --> 00:16:47.973 line:95%,end
You know you got your music coming out.

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:49.308 line:95%,end
Your album is about to drop.

00:16:49.375 --> 00:16:52.244 line:95%,end
Like you're about to--
a lot of things are happening for you.

00:16:55.714 --> 00:16:57.149 line:5%,start
Turn the feet out.

00:16:57.216 --> 00:16:58.317 line:5%,start
Have fun with it.

00:16:58.384 --> 00:16:59.918 line:95%,end
Make the judges smile.

00:17:00.185 --> 00:17:02.755 line:95%,end
Balls of the feet. Pretty legs.
Foot, foot, foot.

00:17:02.921 --> 00:17:04.857 line:95%,end
Think about the foot, the foot, the foot.

00:17:05.057 --> 00:17:06.592 line:95%,end
Even if Mackenzie was here,

00:17:06.658 --> 00:17:08.794 line:95%,end
I think Asia would still be
doing the solo.

00:17:09.261 --> 00:17:14.233 line:95%,end
I am featuring her as the pink flamingo
from the Flamingo Hotel.

00:17:14.767 --> 00:17:18.437 line:95%,end
She has her nose up in the air
and and that tail up high.

00:17:18.537 --> 00:17:22.408 line:95%,end
She is going to strut out on that stage
like she owns the Strip.

00:17:23.809 --> 00:17:26.178 line:95%,end
Tighten the knee. Tighten the knee.
Tighten the knee. Stronger!

00:17:26.912 --> 00:17:28.547 line:95%,end
Asia is hitting everything.

00:17:28.614 --> 00:17:31.683 line:5%,start
I think this one is going to be
the top routine in a winning routine.

00:17:40.726 --> 00:17:42.861 line:95%,end
It's only three months.

00:17:42.928 --> 00:17:44.997 line:95%,end
I'm really excited that Brooke got invited

00:17:45.064 --> 00:17:46.732 line:95%,end
to go to this local news show.

00:17:46.799 --> 00:17:49.068 line:95%,end
Don't be shy.
Don't be nervous.

00:17:49.134 --> 00:17:51.370 line:95%,end
Act like you're talking to your friends.

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:53.906 line:95%,end
I get really quiet and
still when I'm nervous.

00:17:53.972 --> 00:17:55.741 line:95%,end
And I'm really nervous right now.

00:17:55.808 --> 00:17:58.544 line:95%,end
So I just really hope everything goes OK

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:00.546 line:95%,end
and my mom doesn't embarrass me.

00:18:00.612 --> 00:18:02.614 line:95%,end
KELLY: You look beautiful.

00:18:04.316 --> 00:18:06.285 line:5%,start
I don't know how you can't be nervous.

00:18:07.119 --> 00:18:09.721 line:95%,end
Or are you just nervous
and you're not telling me?

00:18:10.956 --> 00:18:12.624 line:95%,end
They're going to ask you questions.

00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:14.927 line:95%,end
What if they ask you a question
and you don't know the answer.

00:18:15.027 --> 00:18:16.895 line:95%,end
Are you going to be nervous?

00:18:17.229 --> 00:18:18.597 line:95%,end
No, I'll just look at you.

00:18:18.764 --> 00:18:20.532 line:95%,end
[laughs]
OK.

00:18:23.435 --> 00:18:26.038 line:95%,end
Don't look at me because
I probably won't know the answer.

00:18:26.105 --> 00:18:28.507 line:95%,end
I'm not the smart one here, you are.

00:18:28.574 --> 00:18:31.910 line:95%,end
I'm trying to talk to Brooke
and tell her questions that I think

00:18:32.044 --> 00:18:33.412 line:95%,end
they might ask her.

00:18:33.479 --> 00:18:35.747 line:95%,end
And she's just like, Mom.

00:18:35.814 --> 00:18:37.649 line:95%,end
You know, like, I'm good.

00:18:39.184 --> 00:18:40.285 line:95%,end
Oh this is pretty.

00:18:40.352 --> 00:18:41.720 line:95%,end
Oh, that's cute.

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:45.757 line:95%,end
You know just having the
opportunity to get word out

00:18:45.824 --> 00:18:48.727 line:95%,end
that she's putting out a CD is amazing.

00:18:48.861 --> 00:18:50.062 line:95%,end
Ready?
- Hm, hm.

00:18:50.129 --> 00:18:53.632 line:95%,end
All right, let's go do this.
I'm so excited.

00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:57.169 line:95%,end
I don't know, I just wish
we would go out and get it over with

00:18:57.302 --> 00:19:00.439 line:95%,end
because the more I sit here,
the more nervous I get.

00:19:00.506 --> 00:19:03.108 line:5%,start
MALE HOST: We're happy to
have Brooke and Kelly Hyland here tonight.

00:19:03.208 --> 00:19:05.777 line:5%,start
FEMALE HOST: I'm so excited. Hi, honey.
How are you? Hi, Kelly.

00:19:05.878 --> 00:19:07.045 line:5%,start
Thanks for having us.

00:19:07.179 --> 00:19:09.314 line:5%,start
So you've got an album that's
coming out in August, right?

00:19:09.515 --> 00:19:11.617 line:5%,start
Yes, it's coming out on August 13.

00:19:11.683 --> 00:19:13.652 line:5%,start
And it's called Brooke Hyland.

00:19:14.653 --> 00:19:16.288 line:5%,start
Very original name.

00:19:17.256 --> 00:19:23.128 line:5%,start
(SINGING) 'Cause I hurt, yeah,
I hurt all over my body.

00:19:23.228 --> 00:19:27.766 line:5%,start
I dance.
I just dance to get through.

00:19:28.133 --> 00:19:30.569 line:5%,start
So how was it working
in the recording studio?

00:19:30.636 --> 00:19:33.105 line:5%,start
I imagine there's a whole
team that you worked with.

00:19:33.172 --> 00:19:34.540 line:5%,start
Yeah it was a lot of fun.

00:19:34.606 --> 00:19:36.842 line:5%,start
It was something different
because I'm used to dancing.

00:19:36.909 --> 00:19:40.479 line:5%,start
So it was good to do something new.

00:19:40.546 --> 00:19:43.482 line:95%,end
I'm really glad that we decided
to go and take the time

00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:45.117 line:95%,end
to come to the news station.

00:19:47.219 --> 00:19:49.988 line:95%,end
I mean I know Abby's mad
that Brooke missed rehearsal,

00:19:50.055 --> 00:19:52.758 line:95%,end
but I just feel like
this was a great opportunity

00:19:52.824 --> 00:19:55.427 line:95%,end
for her and missing one hour of class.

00:19:55.894 --> 00:19:58.430 line:95%,end
Whatever Brooke missed,
I'm sure she can make up.


00:20:08.907 --> 00:20:11.443 line:5%,start
Go in there and keep your cool.
Don't get upset.

00:20:11.677 --> 00:20:14.346 line:95%,end
OK, give me a hug.
Have fun.

00:20:14.413 --> 00:20:15.847 line:95%,end
It's dance class.

00:20:15.914 --> 00:20:17.349 line:95%,end
I'm worried about Paige.

00:20:17.416 --> 00:20:20.385 line:5%,start
Her relationship with Abby is
making her a nervous wreck.

00:20:20.452 --> 00:20:22.788 line:95%,end
Look at Paige down there
practicing all by herself.

00:20:22.854 --> 00:20:25.123 line:95%,end
I don't know what my option is.

00:20:25.457 --> 00:20:28.026 line:95%,end
I said, you know,
I know you want to be here.

00:20:28.093 --> 00:20:30.229 line:95%,end
But this isn't healthy for you.

00:20:30.629 --> 00:20:33.699 line:95%,end
And she just, I want to be here
because my friends are here.

00:20:33.765 --> 00:20:35.400 line:95%,end
JILL: You know what? [interposing voices]

00:20:35.467 --> 00:20:36.668 line:95%,end
I have to get.

00:20:36.735 --> 00:20:39.371 line:95%,end
like I've come back for that
like so many times.

00:20:39.438 --> 00:20:40.806 line:95%,end
I can't do that any more.
- No.

00:20:40.906 --> 00:20:42.941 line:95%,end
- I'm like, you'll find new friends.
- No.

00:20:43.075 --> 00:20:44.710 line:95%,end
No, she won't.

00:20:44.776 --> 00:20:46.878 line:95%,end
I mean, I know she will
but these girls will always

00:20:46.945 --> 00:20:48.914 line:95%,end
be her friends.
We live so close.

00:20:48.981 --> 00:20:50.849 line:5%,start
I'm really worried about Kelly.

00:20:50.916 --> 00:20:54.152 line:5%,start
Brook and Paige and Kelly have
been through a lot with Abby

00:20:54.219 --> 00:20:56.588 line:5%,start
and I hate to see Paige so upset.

00:20:56.888 --> 00:20:57.990 line:5%,start
It kills me.

00:21:03.562 --> 00:21:06.498 line:95%,end
I want to see that face, like
that image, and it's weird.

00:21:06.565 --> 00:21:07.933 line:95%,end
It's like spooky.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.736 line:95%,end
It's mystical.

00:21:11.203 --> 00:21:13.572 line:5%,start
Kendall's routine is called "Luxor."

00:21:13.705 --> 00:21:15.774 line:5%,start
And she's an Egyptian princess.

00:21:15.841 --> 00:21:18.777 line:5%,start
So it's very important to get
the arms and the hands right.

00:21:18.844 --> 00:21:20.412 line:95%,end
And Kendall is a little lazy.

00:21:20.479 --> 00:21:24.082 line:95%,end
She's letting her elbows drop and I
want to see the straight, perpendicular,

00:21:24.149 --> 00:21:25.617 line:95%,end
and parallel lines.

00:21:25.684 --> 00:21:28.320 line:95%,end
Sometimes she's great in
rehearsal and bad on stage.

00:21:28.387 --> 00:21:31.023 line:95%,end
I need Kendall to be consistent.

00:21:33.825 --> 00:21:36.328 line:95%,end
Don't dance so close to the mirrors.

00:21:37.062 --> 00:21:41.433 line:5%,start
With Chloe's sitting out this week,
this is Kendall's chance to shine.

00:21:44.803 --> 00:21:46.738 line:95%,end
Back leg higher.

00:21:46.805 --> 00:21:48.774 line:95%,end
If Kendall wins this competition,

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:51.476 line:95%,end
then Abby will have to
give her a solo at Nationals.

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:53.645 line:95%,end
Let's go, come on in.

00:21:57.015 --> 00:22:01.720 line:95%,end
So we're going to have the girls
are going to perform one at a time.

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:04.823 line:95%,end
Each member of a group
should be able to do that

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:07.526 line:95%,end
group routine choreography like a soloist.

00:22:07.826 --> 00:22:10.529 line:95%,end
When they do it
one at a time by themselves,

00:22:11.196 --> 00:22:15.600 line:95%,end
it gives us the opportunity to see
who's using the wrong arms on a turn

00:22:15.667 --> 00:22:18.136 line:95%,end
or who's turning one more time
than everybody else.

00:22:18.203 --> 00:22:19.671 line:95%,end
Are we ready to go?

00:22:30.349 --> 00:22:32.050 line:95%,end
Kendall's on.

00:22:33.018 --> 00:22:34.519 line:95%,end
Come on, tighten up.

00:22:36.988 --> 00:22:38.957 line:5%,start
I wish Ricky could teach
the group rehearsal

00:22:39.024 --> 00:22:42.461 line:5%,start
because he gives you nice critiques,
not screaming at you.

00:22:43.128 --> 00:22:45.397 line:95%,end
ABBY: Face, face, face!
Come on!

00:22:47.366 --> 00:22:49.234 line:95%,end
Got to get higher in the air!

00:22:54.172 --> 00:22:56.775 line:95%,end
[clapping]

00:22:57.609 --> 00:22:59.177 line:95%,end
Paige, you're up.

00:23:05.951 --> 00:23:08.053 line:95%,end
- You OK?
- I can't breathe.

00:23:13.492 --> 00:23:15.527 line:95%,end
PAIGE: I just need water.

00:23:17.362 --> 00:23:19.131 line:95%,end
I've challenged Paige.

00:23:19.398 --> 00:23:22.467 line:95%,end
Every single girl in the group had
to the routine by themselves.

00:23:22.868 --> 00:23:25.570 line:95%,end
She should know this stands
just as well as everybody else.

00:23:25.637 --> 00:23:27.572 line:95%,end
I don't know what's going on with you.

00:23:27.639 --> 00:23:29.374 line:95%,end
But you need to get your act together.

00:23:29.441 --> 00:23:31.543 line:95%,end
You are 12 years old.

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:34.413 line:95%,end
You are way too old to be forgetting.

00:23:34.479 --> 00:23:36.448 line:95%,end
Paige, I think you're having like anxiety,

00:23:36.915 --> 00:23:40.919 line:95%,end
and she gets you so nervous
that you can't function.

00:23:41.486 --> 00:23:44.089 line:95%,end
Like this is not right at a dance class.

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:46.825 line:95%,end
If Abby didn't have a lot of connections

00:23:46.892 --> 00:23:50.328 line:95%,end
to get these kids ahead,
I would've left a long time ago.

00:23:52.063 --> 00:23:54.366 line:95%,end
Paige, we have to get out of here.

00:23:55.167 --> 00:23:56.368 line:95%,end
We have to get out of here.

00:23:56.635 --> 00:23:58.069 line:5%,start
[sobbing]

00:24:00.605 --> 00:24:02.674 line:95%,end
Paige is so afraid of Abby right now.

00:24:02.741 --> 00:24:04.342 line:95%,end
It's killing me inside.

00:24:04.409 --> 00:24:06.244 line:95%,end
I just don't know what to do.

00:24:06.311 --> 00:24:07.546 line:95%,end
It's OK.


00:24:14.753 --> 00:24:18.557 line:5%,start
I'm excited to be in Vegas this week.
I love the lights. I like the energy.

00:24:18.623 --> 00:24:20.358 line:5%,start
It's just entertainment capital.

00:24:20.425 --> 00:24:24.362 line:5%,start
So you have lots of kids
who are being groomed for careers

00:24:24.429 --> 00:24:25.730 line:5%,start
in entertainment.

00:24:26.631 --> 00:24:28.266 line:95%,end
Why didn't Abby ride with us?

00:24:28.333 --> 00:24:30.602 line:95%,end
- Is she coming?
JILL: She's at a different hotel.

00:24:30.669 --> 00:24:32.938 line:95%,end
- Oh, OK.
JILL: She still could have met us.

00:24:33.538 --> 00:24:35.807 line:95%,end
Maybe she's not coming.
- She'll be here. She'll be here.

00:24:35.874 --> 00:24:39.911 line:95%,end
I think the best way for me
to boost Paige's confidence is

00:24:39.978 --> 00:24:42.781 line:95%,end
for me to have her go up
on stage and show Abby,

00:24:42.848 --> 00:24:44.416 line:5%,start
I want to be part of this team.

00:24:44.483 --> 00:24:47.719 line:95%,end
And I'm going to get up on that stage
and I'm going to dance.

00:24:47.786 --> 00:24:50.956 line:95%,end
I personally think we're the luckiest
people in Vegas right now.

00:24:51.022 --> 00:24:52.958 line:95%,end
JILL: Why?
- Abby's not here.

00:24:53.091 --> 00:24:55.293 line:95%,end
[chuckling]

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:57.896 line:95%,end
How about you girls?
Do you want Abby here?

00:25:01.633 --> 00:25:03.268 line:95%,end
Abby is coming.

00:25:03.335 --> 00:25:06.271 line:95%,end
- Woo, hoo!
- Oh, she's here.

00:25:06.371 --> 00:25:08.740 line:95%,end
ABBY: Look at you guys.
You all look beautiful.

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:09.875 line:95%,end
Thank you.

00:25:09.975 --> 00:25:11.977 line:5%,start
Personally, I'm glad that Abby's here.

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:15.981 line:5%,start
I think she wants to make sure
her girls represent her well.

00:25:16.147 --> 00:25:17.249 line:95%,end
ABBY: Presenting.

00:25:17.582 --> 00:25:19.751 line:95%,end
[oohs and aaahs]

00:25:23.388 --> 00:25:25.323 line:95%,end
You're so pretty.

00:25:30.829 --> 00:25:32.531 line:95%,end
Come on, let's go.

00:25:50.815 --> 00:25:52.150 line:5%,start
JILL: What's wrong?

00:25:53.518 --> 00:25:55.520 line:95%,end

Kendall started out strong

I don't know what's going on with her.

00:27:13.264 --> 00:27:15.767 line:95%,end
I wanted her to really
get in the judge's eyes,

00:27:15.967 --> 00:27:17.068 line:95%,end
but she didn't do that.

00:27:17.202 --> 00:27:19.471 line:95%,end
She was too busy concentrating
on the choreography.

00:27:23.708 --> 00:27:26.177 line:5%,start
Asia's ready,
when I know she's competent and ready

00:27:26.244 --> 00:27:27.679 line:5%,start
it's going to be a great day.

00:27:27.746 --> 00:27:30.248 line:5%,start
I have not one concern for Asia.

And that was "The Flamingo" number seven.

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:39.350 line:5%,start
I thought I did really well
and I don't think I can change anything.

00:28:39.417 --> 00:28:42.554 line:5%,start
But I need to improve on my feet,
but that's easy to fix.

00:28:44.856 --> 00:28:46.958 line:95%,end
I think my biggest
concern for Brooke's solo

00:28:47.025 --> 00:28:51.896 line:95%,end
is for Brooke to get out there and dance
the way Brooke can dance.

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:55.033 line:95%,end
When she dances, she holds back.

00:28:56.367 --> 00:28:57.969 line:95%,end
And I do blame that on Abby.

00:28:58.436 --> 00:29:01.873 line:5%,start
All right, we [inaudible] number 71,
is 18 contemporary solo.

But I never knew
how I could find it until now.

00:29:31.836 --> 00:29:36.908 line:95%,end
I was locked up in fear and doubt.

00:29:37.308 --> 00:29:40.011 line:95%,end
Now is my time.

00:29:40.411 --> 00:29:47.418 line:95%,end
I found the key, trusting that everything
will come without [inaudible].

00:29:50.421 --> 00:29:53.124 line:95%,end
Now is my time.

ANNOUNCER: And that was
number 79, "Now is my Time."

00:30:07.238 --> 00:30:09.841 line:95%,end
Brooke's dancing looked very abrupt.

00:30:09.908 --> 00:30:14.279 line:95%,end
And I thought that her facial expressions
were pure concentration.

00:30:14.345 --> 00:30:16.915 line:95%,end
Ricky doesn't know
what Brooke is capable of.

00:30:17.782 --> 00:30:19.684 line:95%,end
When you're in that room with Abby,

00:30:19.984 --> 00:30:23.521 line:95%,end
you have a look on your face
like you want her approval.

00:30:24.155 --> 00:30:26.991 line:95%,end
You don't need her approval.
You need his.

00:30:27.058 --> 00:30:28.993 line:95%,end
Go show them how fabulous you are.

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:31.963 line:95%,end
I think at this point
my biggest concern for Paige

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:34.966 line:95%,end
is, I want her to get on stage.

00:30:35.033 --> 00:30:38.970 line:95%,end

00:31:29.387 --> 00:31:36.394 line:95%,end
Now I can see how much love me.

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:43.501 line:95%,end
You are right by my side.

00:31:49.474 --> 00:31:51.442 line:5%,start
It's OK.
It's OK.

- Are you proud of yourself?
- No.

00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:57.916 line:95%,end
She would have don't a can-can
and remembered my dance.

00:31:58.082 --> 00:32:01.653 line:95%,end
Honey, honey, you're not going to get
in trouble because I created it.

00:32:01.719 --> 00:32:02.954 line:95%,end
I created it. OK?

00:32:03.388 --> 00:32:06.824 line:95%,end
I bet $100 that she was going to forget it
and run off the stage.

00:32:08.493 --> 00:32:10.161 line:95%,end
Her mother doesn't bring her to class.

00:32:13.631 --> 00:32:16.534 line:95%,end
So this all goes back to Kelly.
It's her fault.


00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:21.539 line:5%,start
She's afraid of her dance teacher.

00:32:21.606 --> 00:32:24.175 line:5%,start
She is scared to death
of her dance teacher.

00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:28.413 line:5%,start
No, you're not going to get in trouble,
Paige, because guess what?

00:32:28.479 --> 00:32:31.015 line:95%,end
She's not your teacher.
She didn't teach you.

00:32:31.115 --> 00:32:35.620 line:95%,end
She's horrible.
And you're trying to do your best for her?

We're all crazy.

00:32:37.989 --> 00:32:40.458 line:5%,start
When Paige came off the stage, she said,

00:32:40.525 --> 00:32:44.195 line:5%,start
all I wanted to do was show her
that I could do this.

00:32:44.262 --> 00:32:46.130 line:95%,end
And I couldn't cause she scared me.

00:32:57.842 --> 00:33:01.379 line:95%,end
Paige is a wreck and
I just feel like this is the worst thing

00:33:01.446 --> 00:33:02.714 line:95%,end
that could have happened.

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:05.950 line:95%,end
And I hope that Abby doesn't
take it out on Paige.

00:33:06.017 --> 00:33:07.518 line:95%,end
I mean, the kid's only human.

00:33:08.186 --> 00:33:11.255 line:95%,end
Abby, are my girls in the group dance?

00:33:11.522 --> 00:33:12.757 line:95%,end
You brought in choreographers.

00:33:12.824 --> 00:33:14.125 line:95%,end
This is not about your children.

00:33:14.192 --> 00:33:15.893 line:95%,end
This is about you.

00:33:16.127 --> 00:33:18.563 line:95%,end
You need to play by my rules.

00:33:18.629 --> 00:33:23.801 line:95%,end
I asked for choreography
that was what my kids can do.

00:33:23.868 --> 00:33:26.437 line:95%,end

00:33:26.504 --> 00:33:30.041 line:95%,end

- OK.

00:33:30.108 --> 00:33:33.111 line:95%,end
I am the best thing for Paige.
Because you know what?

00:33:33.177 --> 00:33:36.047 line:95%,end
She had a gorgeous costume.
She was doing a can-can.

00:33:36.114 --> 00:33:38.282 line:95%,end
And Paige would have done it.

00:33:38.349 --> 00:33:41.152 line:95%,end
She would've went out on that stage
and she would have looked gorgeous.

00:33:41.219 --> 00:33:42.487 line:95%,end
I know that. But guess what?

00:33:42.587 --> 00:33:45.757 line:95%,end
My daughter was a wreck all fricking week.

00:33:46.257 --> 00:33:50.395 line:95%,end
And now my kid is having attacks
because she is afraid of you,

00:33:50.862 --> 00:33:53.297 line:95%,end
and afraid of
what you're going to do to her.

00:33:53.364 --> 00:33:55.933 line:95%,end
And you're allowing this
with the relationship

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.070 line:95%,end
that you had with my kids and me.

00:33:59.937 --> 00:34:02.373 line:95%,end
OK, understood.
I'm hearing you.

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:05.877 line:95%,end
And it breaks my heart.
It is horrible.

00:34:06.344 --> 00:34:10.782 line:95%,end
Kelly, you have driven the wedge
between your children and myself.

00:34:10.848 --> 00:34:12.216 line:95%,end
- No, Abby.
- Yes.

00:34:12.283 --> 00:34:14.819 line:95%,end
The things you say to them
has driven the wedge.

00:34:14.886 --> 00:34:16.654 line:95%,end
- No.
- And it's not me.

00:34:16.721 --> 00:34:18.923 line:95%,end
I would never allow this to happen.

00:34:20.024 --> 00:34:21.659 line:95%,end

Seeing Kelly break down at a competition
like this really disturbs me.

When I look at Kelly,
I don't see the mom of two dancers

00:34:33.771 --> 00:34:37.208 line:5%,start

I see my own student

00:34:37.275 --> 00:34:41.646 line:5%,start
when she was 12 or 13 years old
crying her eyeballs out.

00:34:41.979 --> 00:34:44.182 line:95%,end
That's when she stopped dancing.

00:34:44.248 --> 00:34:47.218 line:95%,end
And I think Kelly could have
had a great future.

00:34:47.285 --> 00:34:50.388 line:95%,end
I just hope she doesn't do
the same thing to her two girls.

00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:44.929 line:5%,start
And I think it's really going
to be hard for Mackenzie

00:37:44.996 --> 00:37:46.697 line:5%,start
to get a solo at Nationals.

00:37:46.764 --> 00:37:49.233 line:95%,end
She has to prove that
she's in it to win it.

00:37:49.734 --> 00:37:54.839 line:95%,end
ANNOUNCER: Divisional overall
for highest elite junior solo.

00:37:55.906 --> 00:38:00.478 line:95%,end
Sixth place, entry number 28 "The Luxor."

00:38:04.649 --> 00:38:07.685 line:95%,end
She comes out 6th in the overalls.
I'll take it.

00:38:07.952 --> 00:38:10.354 line:5%,start
I'm not sure Abby is going
to be pleased with it.

00:38:10.621 --> 00:38:13.557 line:5%,start
But there's always next time.
I don't know what else to say about it.

00:38:14.792 --> 00:38:19.430 line:5%,start
ANNOUNCER: Third place, entry
number 71, "Now is my Time."

00:38:23.334 --> 00:38:26.404 line:95%,end
I'm proud of Brooke because I thought
Brooke's dance was amazing.

00:38:26.671 --> 00:38:29.840 line:95%,end
But if Brooke would have danced
the way Brooke can dance,

00:38:29.907 --> 00:38:32.410 line:95%,end
she would have definitely
brought home first.

00:38:32.476 --> 00:38:33.978 line:95%,end
ANNOUNCER: All right here we go.

00:38:34.045 --> 00:38:37.248 line:95%,end
Our the highest elite junior small group.

00:38:37.815 --> 00:38:39.450 line:95%,end
Third place, "Rapture."

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:41.152 line:5%,start
[applause]

00:38:42.453 --> 00:38:45.289 line:95%,end
Second place "Junior Prodigy."

00:38:45.356 --> 00:38:47.658 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:38:49.126 --> 00:38:53.064 line:5%,start
And first place
in the elite juniors small group

00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:55.566 line:5%,start
entry number 46, "Brat Pack."

00:38:55.633 --> 00:38:58.102 line:5%,start
[cheering]

00:39:00.971 --> 00:39:03.741 line:95%,end
The Abby Lee Dance
company came to Vegas

00:39:03.841 --> 00:39:05.109 line:95%,end
and hit the jackpot.

00:39:05.176 --> 00:39:07.078 line:95%,end
Chloe, Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:39:09.447 --> 00:39:11.916 line:95%,end
Hey, luck be a lady tonight.

00:39:14.018 --> 00:39:15.686 line:95%,end
I thought they looked adorable.

00:39:15.753 --> 00:39:17.021 line:95%,end
I did too.

00:39:17.088 --> 00:39:18.789 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I think you had
a really good conversation

00:39:18.856 --> 00:39:20.458 line:95%,end
with Abby, don't you?

00:39:20.591 --> 00:39:22.660 line:95%,end
I think it was a good start.

00:39:22.727 --> 00:39:24.628 line:95%,end
The fundamental issue is trust.

00:39:24.695 --> 00:39:28.666 line:95%,end
And without trust,
it's really hard to move forward.

00:39:28.766 --> 00:39:30.501 line:95%,end
Well, I really and truly, Holly,

00:39:30.568 --> 00:39:32.703 line:95%,end
don't trust her with my
kids right at the moment.

00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:33.904 line:95%,end
I don't.
I'm sorry.

00:39:33.971 --> 00:39:36.474 line:95%,end
She's going to need to
re-earn that trust with Paige.

00:39:38.409 --> 00:39:41.078 line:95%,end
[cheering]

00:39:48.519 --> 00:39:53.791 line:95%,end
Hey, remember, whatever happens in Vegas,
stays in Vegas.

00:39:53.858 --> 00:39:56.127 line:95%,end
You looked great in the group dance.

00:39:56.861 --> 00:39:59.196 line:95%,end
All right so you, unbeatable.

00:40:00.498 --> 00:40:02.366 line:95%,end
Has she lost her solo?

00:40:02.433 --> 00:40:03.734 line:95%,end
No.

00:40:03.868 --> 00:40:06.003 line:95%,end
I hate to say it, but, Mackenzie,

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:08.739 line:95%,end
until she steps it up on stage
and starts to threaten her.

00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:10.408 line:95%,end
All right?

00:40:10.508 --> 00:40:11.876 line:95%,end
But Mackenzie is coming back next week.

00:40:11.942 --> 00:40:13.611 line:95%,end
- So.
- I know.

00:40:13.677 --> 00:40:15.980 line:95%,end
But you just have to realize
that she might not be dancing.

00:40:16.447 --> 00:40:18.716 line:95%,end
I'm talking about nationals
in two weeks, Melissa.

00:40:18.883 --> 00:40:20.551 line:95%,end
I have to go with the win.

00:40:21.352 --> 00:40:23.487 line:95%,end
This is Nationals.
This is important.

00:40:24.922 --> 00:40:27.725 line:95%,end
Kendall, sixth?

00:40:27.792 --> 00:40:29.260 line:95%,end
Is that way you set out to do?

00:40:29.326 --> 00:40:31.562 line:95%,end
I think I could have hit my turns better.

00:40:31.629 --> 00:40:34.799 line:95%,end
I was watching you
for that junior spot,

00:40:35.065 --> 00:40:37.368 line:95%,end
that solo for Nationals in two weeks.

00:40:38.402 --> 00:40:40.237 line:95%,end
Sixth will not cut it.

00:40:40.337 --> 00:40:44.875 line:95%,end
Brooke, Paige, I hope to
see you in class on Monday.

00:40:45.309 --> 00:40:48.045 line:95%,end
Kelly, nice talking to you today.

00:40:49.013 --> 00:40:51.348 line:95%,end
You know I feel like
after my talk with Abby today,

00:40:51.415 --> 00:40:54.084 line:95%,end
there might be a little bit of hope.

00:40:54.151 --> 00:40:55.886 line:95%,end
I will see you.
Enjoy yourself.

00:40:55.953 --> 00:40:57.421 line:95%,end
Girls, please be safe.

00:40:57.488 --> 00:40:58.989 line:95%,end
All right, try to see a show.

00:40:59.156 --> 00:41:00.858 line:95%,end
- Congrats, ladies.
- Thanks, Ab.

00:41:03.794 --> 00:41:05.095 line:95%,end
ABBY: Next on "Dance Moms."

00:41:05.162 --> 00:41:07.965 line:5%,start
We only have one more week
before Nationals.

00:41:08.032 --> 00:41:11.235 line:5%,start
Dance Spirit Magazine contacted me.

00:41:11.302 --> 00:41:14.104 line:5%,start
We're just here to do a day
in the life of Maddie.

00:41:14.171 --> 00:41:16.140 line:5%,start
ABBY: You should be representing
the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:41:16.207 --> 00:41:17.374 line:5%,start
Don't let me down this week.

00:41:17.441 --> 00:41:18.476 line:5%,start
Nationals!

00:41:18.542 --> 00:41:20.444 line:5%,start
Will you be the one chosen to perform

00:41:20.511 --> 00:41:22.346 line:5%,start
or will you be the one
sitting in the audience?

00:41:22.446 --> 00:41:24.748 line:5%,start
Let her run her number,
Abby, then pick on her.

00:41:24.849 --> 00:41:26.116 line:5%,start
Stop.

00:41:26.183 --> 00:41:28.986 line:5%,start
You know what it's going to be like
if the Abby Lee Dance Company loses?

00:41:29.286 --> 00:41:30.888 line:5%,start
One week till Nationals.
