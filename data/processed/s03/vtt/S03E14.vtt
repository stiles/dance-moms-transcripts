ABBY: Previously,
on "Dance Moms"--

00:00:03.503 --> 00:00:04.571 line:5%,start
We need to beat Cathy.

00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:05.872 line:5%,start
She's dirt under your feet.

00:00:05.972 --> 00:00:07.340 line:5%,start
CATHY: We won last time.

00:00:07.407 --> 00:00:08.742 line:5%,start
Remember that.

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:10.543 line:5%,start
I'm really not sure who I
want to use as Rosa Parks.

00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:12.545 line:5%,start
Let's give it to one of the blondes.

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:14.581 line:5%,start
JILL: Christi and
Kelly are going berserk.

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:16.249 line:5%,start
She just threw all of us under the bus.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.585 line:5%,start
CATHY: You guys
are the best of the best.

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:20.153 line:5%,start
That's why you're here.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.688 line:5%,start
Brooke doesn't know what she's doing.

CHRISTI: Ding
dong, the witch is dead.

00:00:28.428 --> 00:00:31.097 line:5%,start
Every time I've seen your kid,
they do the exact same move.

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:32.365 line:5%,start
There's nothing different.

00:00:32.432 --> 00:00:33.433 line:5%,start

ABBY: Coming
up on "Dance moms."

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:36.202 line:5%,start
Abby, your guest is here.

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:37.303 line:5%,start
Is she fabulous?
GIA: Yeah.

00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:40.173 line:5%,start
Oh, oh, there's some hairography going on
down there.

00:00:40.306 --> 00:00:42.142 line:5%,start
RACHELLE: I want you to have a secret.
Show--

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:44.044 line:5%,start
There's a few of them
that have some secrets.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.278 line:5%,start
Which you got on your finger, there?

00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:46.579 line:5%,start
I got married!

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:48.248 line:5%,start
Wait, what?

00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:50.016 line:5%,start
This is what she does
to you every weekend.

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:51.251 line:5%,start
And you let her psych you out.

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:55.922 line:5%,start
JILL: This is your team.
These are your girls.

00:00:56.022 --> 00:00:57.724 line:5%,start
This is your name on their backs.

00:00:57.791 --> 00:00:59.092 line:5%,start
I'm really nervous.

THEME SONG: Get up.

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:05.265 line:95%,end
Get on the floor.

00:01:05.365 --> 00:01:10.804 line:95%,end
My world is with my girls,
living on the dance floor.

[music playing]

00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:21.881 line:95%,end
Let's go now.

00:01:25.485 --> 00:01:27.287 line:95%,end
All right.

00:01:27.387 --> 00:01:33.560 line:95%,end
We went to Powerhouse Dance
Competition in Cincinnati, Ohio

00:01:33.626 --> 00:01:34.828 line:95%,end
and we won.

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:36.029 line:95%,end
[moms clapping]

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:38.398 line:95%,end
The overall high score winners--

00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:41.601 line:95%,end
Entry number 87, "Rosa Parks."

00:01:41.668 --> 00:01:43.436 line:95%,end
[applause and cheers]

00:01:43.503 --> 00:01:45.805 line:5%,start
ABBY: The Cathy,
sitting in that audience,

00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:51.644 line:5%,start
having to watch you guys
win that overall, priceless.

00:01:51.744 --> 00:01:53.446 line:5%,start
You're only as good as your last win.

00:01:53.513 --> 00:01:57.584 line:5%,start
So I can not teach these girls
to rest on their laurels.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.455 line:95%,end
This week, we will be
attending Dance Expressions

00:02:02.522 --> 00:02:04.858 line:95%,end
in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.827 line:95%,end
Now let's start the pyramid.

00:02:07.927 --> 00:02:09.429 line:95%,end
We have Brooke.

00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:11.598 line:95%,end
Not only did you forget the routine,

00:02:11.664 --> 00:02:15.301 line:95%,end
but you talked to Rosa Parks.

00:02:15.368 --> 00:02:17.203 line:95%,end
Why are you talking to Rosa Parks?

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:18.705 line:95%,end
BROOKE: I was like, oh, my gosh.

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:20.106 line:95%,end
I just messed up so bad.

00:02:20.173 --> 00:02:21.841 line:95%,end
And she jumped on the thing.
I wasn't really--

00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:24.144 line:95%,end
And she's like, "What do I do?
What do I--"

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.679 line:95%,end
And I was like, oh, my god.

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:28.481 line:95%,end
Kelly, you're laughing.

00:02:28.548 --> 00:02:30.950 line:95%,end
Because she was funny.

00:02:31.017 --> 00:02:32.952 line:95%,end
I don't think it's funny.

00:02:33.186 --> 00:02:34.954 line:95%,end
We could have lost.

00:02:35.021 --> 00:02:37.490 line:95%,end
Do you have any idea
what happened up there?

00:02:37.557 --> 00:02:40.560 line:95%,end
She forgot.
She's human.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.861 line:95%,end
Just like every one of these kids

00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:44.330 line:95%,end
have forgotten their dances on onstage.

00:02:44.397 --> 00:02:49.068 line:95%,end
So I've come to the conclusion
that you need a break.

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:50.170 line:95%,end
I'm just missing you today.

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:54.307 line:95%,end
Go ahead. You can go.

00:02:54.374 --> 00:02:56.543 line:95%,end
I can't believe that Brooke
walked into the pyramid

00:02:56.643 --> 00:02:57.911 line:95%,end
and is standing in front of me.

00:02:58.011 --> 00:02:59.012 line:95%,end
Come on, Brooke.

00:02:59.078 --> 00:03:04.017 line:95%,end
You stood on stage and wandered aimlessly.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.986 line:95%,end
I'm really dismissing Brooke so
that she can go find her brain.

00:03:07.053 --> 00:03:08.988 line:95%,end
Is she not supposed to
come away this weekend?

00:03:09.055 --> 00:03:10.723 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: She is
not traveling with us.

00:03:10.957 --> 00:03:13.927 line:95%,end
She is expected, however, to be in class.

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:18.064 line:95%,end
All right.
Next, I have Mackenzie.

00:03:19.232 --> 00:03:21.601 line:95%,end
You didn't dance.

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:23.369 line:95%,end
Tell me, how's the foot feeling now?

00:03:23.436 --> 00:03:25.605 line:95%,end
It's getting better.

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:29.943 line:95%,end
Have you learned that if you
stay off of it and rest it,

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:32.111 line:95%,end
that it will heal?

00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:34.881 line:95%,end
So doing swing through cartwheels

00:03:34.948 --> 00:03:37.550 line:95%,end
isn't going to help you.

00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:43.556 line:95%,end
Next, Nia-- you were outstanding.

00:03:43.623 --> 00:03:45.792 line:95%,end
I thought you were the right choice.

00:03:45.892 --> 00:03:49.562 line:95%,end
And I thought that you were
beautiful in the white costume.


00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:52.031 line:95%,end
I think Rosa parks would be very proud.

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:57.971 line:5%,start
HOLLY FRAZIER: I'm
disappointed that Nia's not

00:03:58.071 --> 00:04:00.740 line:5%,start
on the top the pyramid this week
because I think she danced

00:04:00.807 --> 00:04:02.575 line:5%,start
extremely well.

00:04:02.642 --> 00:04:05.745 line:5%,start
And if Nia wasn't a convincing Rosa Parks,

00:04:05.812 --> 00:04:07.914 line:5%,start
that group dance would not have won.

00:04:07.981 --> 00:04:10.817 line:95%,end
ABBY: Next, Kendall--

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:12.585 line:95%,end
she was the second overall high scorer

00:04:12.652 --> 00:04:14.821 line:95%,end
out of all those juniors.

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:16.623 line:95%,end
And that's where she is?

00:04:16.723 --> 00:04:18.758 line:95%,end
That's where you are.

00:04:20.326 --> 00:04:22.595 line:95%,end
Next, Chloe--

00:04:23.296 --> 00:04:25.465 line:95%,end
You were part of a duet.

00:04:25.531 --> 00:04:29.936 line:95%,end
You won the overall high score
in the duet trio division.

00:04:30.003 --> 00:04:31.971 line:95%,end
Did you win? Yes.

00:04:32.138 --> 00:04:35.275 line:95%,end
Was it your best performance of your life?
No.

00:04:35.408 --> 00:04:37.377 line:5%,start
Not only is Chloe back on the pyramid,

00:04:37.477 --> 00:04:39.279 line:5%,start
but she's back in the second row.

00:04:39.345 --> 00:04:41.247 line:95%,end
So it's a good week for Clo.

00:04:41.314 --> 00:04:43.750 line:95%,end
ABBY: Next, we have Paige.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.052 line:95%,end
You came to me.
You asked me for the duet.

00:04:46.152 --> 00:04:47.453 line:95%,end
I gave you the duet.

00:04:47.587 --> 00:04:48.821 line:95%,end
That was good.

00:04:48.921 --> 00:04:50.156 line:95%,end
It's up to you to want it.

00:04:50.256 --> 00:04:51.591 line:95%,end
And I keep telling you that.

00:04:51.658 --> 00:04:55.094 line:95%,end
And now, at the top of
the pyramid, Maddie.

00:04:55.161 --> 00:04:57.664 line:95%,end
[clapping]

00:04:57.764 --> 00:05:02.001 line:95%,end
This should be a standing ovation.

00:05:02.101 --> 00:05:04.837 line:95%,end
You gave people chills
when you were dancing.

00:05:04.937 --> 00:05:06.272 line:95%,end
That's what it's all about.

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:09.842 line:95%,end
And if she does not, you can all do that.

00:05:09.942 --> 00:05:11.644 line:95%,end
If you're giving your audience chills,

00:05:11.711 --> 00:05:13.112 line:95%,end
you're doing something right.

00:05:13.179 --> 00:05:15.715 line:95%,end
Kendall, you have another solo.

00:05:18.551 --> 00:05:21.387 line:95%,end
This time, we're going
to work on your stamina.

00:05:21.487 --> 00:05:25.458 line:95%,end
Start jogging in place
and don't make a sound.

00:05:25.525 --> 00:05:27.827 line:95%,end
I have another solo going to Chloe.

00:05:27.894 --> 00:05:29.295 line:95%,end
[clapping]

00:05:29.362 --> 00:05:32.031 line:95%,end
CHLOE: This is my first solo
back from being suspended.

00:05:32.131 --> 00:05:34.634 line:5%,start
And I really want to impress Miss Abby

00:05:34.701 --> 00:05:37.003 line:5%,start
and prove to her that I do want to be here

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.671 line:5%,start
and that I do want this.

00:05:38.738 --> 00:05:41.541 line:95%,end
And I'm willing to work extra hard for it.

00:05:41.908 --> 00:05:44.077 line:95%,end
ABBY: And Maddie,
I'm going to change it up a little

00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:45.678 line:95%,end
bit this week.

00:05:45.745 --> 00:05:48.848 line:95%,end
And I'm going to kind
of make you the leader.

00:05:48.915 --> 00:05:55.455 line:95%,end
So instead of a solo, you're
doing a duet with Mackenzie.

00:05:56.155 --> 00:06:00.660 line:95%,end
The name of your duet is
called "Run From Mother."

00:06:03.763 --> 00:06:06.733 line:95%,end
Now the name of the group routine,
I will tell you.

00:06:06.833 --> 00:06:08.868 line:95%,end
But that's all I'm telling you.

00:06:08.935 --> 00:06:11.738 line:95%,end
Because there's a big
surprise element involved.

00:06:12.105 --> 00:06:15.708 line:95%,end
The name of the group routine
is "Gold Digger."

00:06:15.775 --> 00:06:17.009 line:95%,end
All right?

00:06:17.076 --> 00:06:20.346 line:95%,end
Why don't we start to warm-up
and everybody start jogging.

00:06:20.413 --> 00:06:21.581 line:95%,end
Moms, I'm dismissing you.

00:06:21.647 --> 00:06:22.915 line:95%,end
Go ahead and go.

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:33.793 line:5%,start
Now the name of this group routine

00:06:33.893 --> 00:06:35.628 line:5%,start
is called "Gold Digger."

00:06:35.728 --> 00:06:37.797 line:95%,end
You think about a woman
looking for a guy

00:06:37.864 --> 00:06:40.099 line:95%,end
that has money to spend on them.

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:41.467 line:95%,end
She doesn't really like the guy.

00:06:41.567 --> 00:06:42.635 line:95%,end
She doesn't really think he's cute.

00:06:42.735 --> 00:06:44.070 line:95%,end
CHLOE: Oh, she just
likes him for the money.

00:06:44.137 --> 00:06:45.938 line:5%,start
ABBY: She just
wants the money, yes.

00:06:46.038 --> 00:06:48.441 line:5%,start
We call this routine
"Golddigga."

00:06:48.674 --> 00:06:52.145 line:5%,start
The girls are flirty
with the audience.

00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:54.981 line:95%,end
And there's some Fosse moves.

00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:57.550 line:95%,end
A 1, a 2-- stay in pli.

00:06:57.617 --> 00:06:58.885 line:95%,end
JILL: Gold digger.

00:06:58.951 --> 00:07:01.554 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Um, what you got
on your finger there?

00:07:01.621 --> 00:07:03.489 line:95%,end
I got married!

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:04.991 line:95%,end
Aw!
JILL: Yay!

00:07:05.057 --> 00:07:07.160 line:95%,end
Congratulations!

00:07:07.226 --> 00:07:09.228 line:95%,end
-On a Monday night.
-Can you tell us about it?

00:07:09.295 --> 00:07:10.463 line:95%,end
What do you mean, you got married?

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:12.899 line:95%,end
I got married.
And my best girl was Paige.

00:07:12.965 --> 00:07:14.600 line:95%,end
CHRISTI LUKASIAK: Was it quick and dirty?
HOLLY FRAZIER: Aw.

00:07:14.667 --> 00:07:16.602 line:95%,end
-Wait, what?
-Did you wear your gown?

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:18.638 line:95%,end
I did. I wore my dress.

00:07:18.738 --> 00:07:21.774 line:95%,end
Stop. What? Rewind.
When did you get married?

00:07:21.841 --> 00:07:22.975 line:95%,end
On Monday.

00:07:23.075 --> 00:07:24.977 line:95%,end
And how about--

00:07:25.077 --> 00:07:26.813 line:95%,end
How good am I at keeping a secret?

00:07:26.913 --> 00:07:28.781 line:95%,end
-Thank you.
-You're so good at keeping a secret.

00:07:28.848 --> 00:07:30.750 line:95%,end
I knew because Paige was there.

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:31.984 line:95%,end
KELLY: Did you
know you were getting

00:07:32.084 --> 00:07:33.686 line:95%,end
married on a Monday in your living room?

00:07:33.786 --> 00:07:35.321 line:95%,end
MELISSA ZIEGLER: Yeah.
Like, we just went dress shopping.

00:07:35.388 --> 00:07:37.190 line:95%,end
Why were you trying on, like, gowns?

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:38.825 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Oh, that's a pretty picture.


00:07:38.925 --> 00:07:40.660 line:95%,end
I didn't see that.
MELISSA: It's what you guys wanted to do.

00:07:40.726 --> 00:07:41.861 line:95%,end
Hey, look, Maddie's foot.

00:07:41.994 --> 00:07:43.396 line:95%,end
Abby is the queen of subtleties.

00:07:43.496 --> 00:07:46.699 line:95%,end
Do you think that "Golddigga"
is a tribute to one of the moms?

00:07:49.535 --> 00:07:51.671 line:95%,end
Hit, ball-change.

00:07:51.771 --> 00:07:53.306 line:95%,end
Abby, your guest is here.

00:07:53.773 --> 00:07:55.007 line:95%,end
ABBY: She is?
GIA : She's here.

00:07:55.107 --> 00:07:56.642 line:95%,end
Is she fabulous?
GIA: Yeah.

00:07:56.709 --> 00:07:58.978 line:95%,end
ABBY: Is she ready to work?
Yeah. I'll stay in here.

00:07:59.045 --> 00:08:00.580 line:95%,end
GIA: So--
ABBY: You stay in here.

00:08:00.746 --> 00:08:03.015 line:95%,end
MELISSA: And what's our surprise?
I'd like to know what our surprise is.

00:08:03.082 --> 00:08:05.151 line:95%,end
ABBY: Hello, everybody.

00:08:05.218 --> 00:08:06.419 line:95%,end
Hi.

00:08:06.652 --> 00:08:08.287 line:95%,end
This is your surprise!

00:08:08.354 --> 00:08:09.655 line:95%,end
Hello.

00:08:09.722 --> 00:08:11.290 line:95%,end
Surprise!
MELISSA: Who is that?

00:08:11.357 --> 00:08:12.625 line:95%,end
Do you know who it is? Who is it?

00:08:12.692 --> 00:08:14.660 line:95%,end
JILL: Wait.
I know exactly who that is.

00:08:14.727 --> 00:08:17.296 line:95%,end
Is it the girl from "Flashdance?"
CHRISTI: Wowza.

00:08:17.363 --> 00:08:18.764 line:95%,end
KELLY: I'm built
just like her underneath

00:08:18.865 --> 00:08:20.032 line:95%,end
of this outfit I have on.

00:08:20.099 --> 00:08:22.668 line:95%,end
HOLLY: That's definitely her.
Because I remember seeing her on stage.

00:08:22.768 --> 00:08:25.905 line:5%,start
ABBY: This is Rachelle Rak, a dear,

00:08:26.005 --> 00:08:27.807 line:5%,start
long-time--
I'm no going to say old friend.

00:08:27.874 --> 00:08:29.108 line:5%,start
No, old friend.

00:08:29.208 --> 00:08:33.045 line:95%,end
A dear, long-time friend of mine
who is from Pittsburgh

00:08:33.145 --> 00:08:35.248 line:95%,end
and made it to Broadway.

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:36.616 line:95%,end
RACHELLE: Yeah!
ABBY: Yes.

00:08:36.682 --> 00:08:39.752 line:95%,end
ABBY: And she's really well-known
for her Fosse style.

00:08:39.852 --> 00:08:44.490 line:95%,end
Right now, she is currently
in the tour of "Flashdance."

00:08:44.557 --> 00:08:46.425 line:95%,end
I saw it.
RACHELLE: You did?

00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:49.695 line:95%,end
Well, good. I'm going to give you
a lot of Fosse, a lot of--

00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:51.664 line:95%,end
You can call me Rachelle or Sass.

00:08:51.731 --> 00:08:52.965 line:95%,end
My nickname is Sass.

00:08:53.065 --> 00:08:55.268 line:95%,end
ABBY: I invited Rachelle
to choreograph

00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:56.369 line:95%,end
the group dance this week.

00:08:56.502 --> 00:08:59.705 line:95%,end
With this particular Abby Lee
Dance Company Competition team,

00:08:59.772 --> 00:09:02.108 line:95%,end
we do all the choreography in-house.

00:09:02.241 --> 00:09:05.278 line:95%,end
But I'm making an exception
because I want my girls

00:09:05.378 --> 00:09:09.282 line:95%,end
to work with a professional,
a professional Broadway veteran.

00:09:09.382 --> 00:09:11.517 line:95%,end
I just hope Rachelle can
live up to my expectations.

00:09:12.084 --> 00:09:13.553 line:95%,end
Pinch your blades. Good.

00:09:13.619 --> 00:09:14.787 line:95%,end
These are your shoulder blades. Nice.

00:09:14.854 --> 00:09:16.889 line:95%,end
Now pull it out--
not so turned it.

00:09:16.956 --> 00:09:18.958 line:95%,end
Open your feet up a little bit.
Good.

00:09:19.025 --> 00:09:23.462 line:95%,end
Now Let's rock--
right, left, small, right, left.

00:09:23.596 --> 00:09:26.098 line:95%,end
And now I want you to
do this little hip move.

00:09:26.198 --> 00:09:27.934 line:95%,end
And I want you to have a secret.

00:09:28.301 --> 00:09:30.937 line:95%,end
Can you show me that you have a secret?
Are you ready?

00:09:31.003 --> 00:09:33.940 line:95%,end
ABBY: Oh, there's a few of them
that have some secrets.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.274 line:95%,end
RACHELLE: That's what I want to see.

00:09:35.341 --> 00:09:36.642 line:95%,end
Feet together, here we go.

00:09:36.742 --> 00:09:39.612 line:95%,end
Four birdie arms into a snooty walk.

00:09:39.679 --> 00:09:44.650 line:95%,end
A 5, 6, 7, and down, down, good.

00:09:44.817 --> 00:09:48.321 line:95%,end
Maybe this is Abby's way of
taking a vacation this week.

00:09:48.688 --> 00:09:51.257 line:95%,end
That's what I said.
She's, like, down there on her phone.

00:09:51.691 --> 00:09:54.827 line:95%,end
JILL: Yeah, maybe she's taking
a page out of Cathy's book.

00:09:54.927 --> 00:09:57.797 line:95%,end
"Oh, I'll just hire
a choreographer, sit on my butt.

00:09:57.863 --> 00:09:58.898 line:95%,end
They can do all the work."

00:09:58.965 --> 00:10:00.399 line:95%,end
You know what, though? I'm glad.

00:10:00.466 --> 00:10:01.934 line:95%,end
Because I think--
JILL: Oh, I think it's great.

00:10:02.034 --> 00:10:04.370 line:95%,end
...it's a great change for the kids.

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:07.473 line:95%,end
RACHELLE: So all the things that
I've been talking to you about--

00:10:07.573 --> 00:10:10.943 line:95%,end
finding, standing in your
everything, and the walking

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:13.579 line:95%,end
through your legs, walking
through, doing the turns,

00:10:13.646 --> 00:10:15.181 line:95%,end
putting you on the spot, making you do--

00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:18.150 line:95%,end
these are the things
I want to do for you, Paige,

00:10:18.217 --> 00:10:19.952 line:95%,end
because I want to pull
you out and give you

00:10:20.019 --> 00:10:22.121 line:95%,end
some features in this number.

00:10:22.188 --> 00:10:24.290 line:95%,end
This is such an exciting
moment for Paige.

00:10:24.357 --> 00:10:26.592 line:95%,end
I wish Brooke was here to see it.
- I know.

00:10:26.692 --> 00:10:28.361 line:95%,end
RACHELLE: You know,
sometimes, a choreographer

00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:30.663 line:95%,end
will say, "Rachelle,
what, what do you have?"

00:10:30.763 --> 00:10:32.598 line:95%,end
Well I would say, this is what I have.

00:10:32.665 --> 00:10:34.133 line:95%,end
Here you go.
You want to see it?

00:10:34.333 --> 00:10:40.973 line:95%,end
Ba-dah, ha, sit, reach, head,
yes, and bite the apple.

00:10:41.073 --> 00:10:42.541 line:95%,end
ABBY: Woo!

00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:43.809 line:95%,end
Bravo!

00:10:43.876 --> 00:10:46.312 line:95%,end
Oh, oh, there's some hairography going on
down there.

00:10:46.379 --> 00:10:48.781 line:95%,end
Paige can do that.

00:10:49.015 --> 00:10:52.218 line:95%,end
RACHELLE: 4, 5, 6, 7,
give me a little more sass there.

00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:53.753 line:95%,end
ABBY: Rachelle has great energy.

00:10:53.819 --> 00:10:55.354 line:95%,end
I mean she's a guest.

00:10:55.454 --> 00:10:57.023 line:95%,end
It's like a substitute teacher.

00:10:57.123 --> 00:10:59.558 line:95%,end
But Rachelle, you better speed
it up and teach this number,

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:01.227 line:95%,end
or you're never going to get it finished.

00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:02.328 line:95%,end
Same thing, all right?

00:11:02.395 --> 00:11:05.965 line:95%,end
Feet together, turned in,
pigeon toed, eyes front--

00:11:06.198 --> 00:11:08.200 line:95%,end
This is hurting Chloe
right now, to be pigeon toed.

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:09.602 line:95%,end
She's like, [gasps].
JILL: Yeah.

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:11.404 line:95%,end
Does Abby see she's teaching
them to turn their feet in?

00:11:11.504 --> 00:11:13.005 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:11:13.072 --> 00:11:14.206 line:95%,end
I don't know.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.808 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Abby's is a control freak.

00:11:15.875 --> 00:11:18.911 line:95%,end
She never brings in guest choreographers.

00:11:19.011 --> 00:11:21.547 line:95%,end
And I hope that Rachelle's
choreography is good enough

00:11:21.647 --> 00:11:23.082 line:95%,end
for the girls to win this week.


00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.555 line:5%,start
[music playing]

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:35.828 line:95%,end
Hello.
ABBY: Hello.

00:11:35.995 --> 00:11:38.831 line:95%,end
Brooke, hurry up. You're already
eight minutes late for class.

00:11:38.898 --> 00:11:40.900 line:95%,end
KELLY: Then drive to my house
and pick her up, Abby.

00:11:40.966 --> 00:11:43.736 line:95%,end
That's not the way it works.
Tell her to call a taxi. She's 14.

00:11:43.803 --> 00:11:45.037 line:5%,start
Nobody ever has the week off.

00:11:45.337 --> 00:11:46.572 line:95%,end
So let's just make sure that Brooke

00:11:46.706 --> 00:11:48.441 line:95%,end
is in all the senior company classes

00:11:48.507 --> 00:11:49.709 line:95%,end
that she's supposed to take.

00:11:49.809 --> 00:11:51.043 line:95%,end
She's a [bleep].

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:52.344 line:95%,end
GIA: It was 15, yes.

00:11:52.411 --> 00:11:54.580 line:95%,end
KELLY HYLAND: [bleep]

00:11:54.947 --> 00:11:56.048 line:95%,end
ABBY: Hello, Kendall.

00:11:56.115 --> 00:11:59.785 line:95%,end
Late, late, late, always late.

00:11:59.885 --> 00:12:02.388 line:95%,end
Kendall, what are you
waiting for out there?

00:12:02.488 --> 00:12:04.256 line:95%,end
You keep waiting for
your mother to go places,

00:12:04.356 --> 00:12:06.092 line:95%,end
you're going to be late
the rest of your life.

00:12:08.094 --> 00:12:10.262 line:95%,end
Kendall, good afternoon to you too, huh?

00:12:10.362 --> 00:12:12.098 line:95%,end
[door slams]

00:12:13.966 --> 00:12:15.101 line:95%,end
Don't slam my door.

00:12:15.201 --> 00:12:16.736 line:95%,end
I'll slam whatever I want.

00:12:16.802 --> 00:12:17.937 line:95%,end

00:12:18.037 --> 00:12:19.405 line:95%,end
[side conversation]

00:12:19.705 --> 00:12:20.773 line:95%,end
KELLY HYLAND: Come here, Paige.

00:12:20.906 --> 00:12:22.742 line:95%,end
Make sure, in the beginning,
when you do that, like,

00:12:22.808 --> 00:12:25.044 line:95%,end
- ...rocking your hips--
- Come on, girls. Let's go.

00:12:25.277 --> 00:12:26.879 line:95%,end
ABBY: Come on, come on, come on.

00:12:26.946 --> 00:12:29.081 line:95%,end
Ooh, this is heavy.

00:12:29.148 --> 00:12:31.717 line:95%,end
I want to start right
into the group routine.

00:12:31.784 --> 00:12:33.719 line:95%,end
How was working with Rachelle, last night?

00:12:33.786 --> 00:12:35.654 line:95%,end
It's a lot different
than what we usually do.

00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:38.257 line:95%,end
So it was kind of fun
learning, like, new steps

00:12:38.324 --> 00:12:39.725 line:95%,end
that we don't do.

00:12:39.892 --> 00:12:40.960 line:95%,end
That's Bob Fosse.

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:42.061 line:95%,end
Or, that's Rachelle Rak.

00:12:42.128 --> 00:12:43.596 line:95%,end
That's what they want.

00:12:43.696 --> 00:12:46.432 line:95%,end
So it's important,
as a professional dancer,

00:12:46.499 --> 00:12:48.768 line:95%,end
to give the choreographer and the director

00:12:48.834 --> 00:12:51.203 line:95%,end
and the producers what they want.

00:12:52.138 --> 00:12:54.473 line:95%,end
You know, I wish there was
a magic pill that I could take

00:12:54.573 --> 00:12:57.076 line:95%,end
that I could look like
Rachelle in a leotard.

00:12:57.143 --> 00:12:58.177 line:95%,end
At 40-some.

00:12:58.277 --> 00:13:00.146 line:95%,end
I actually have something we could do.

00:13:00.246 --> 00:13:02.314 line:95%,end
I think you--
-To look like her.

00:13:02.414 --> 00:13:03.983 line:95%,end
I don't know if we're
going to look like her.

00:13:04.083 --> 00:13:06.452 line:95%,end
It's called wiring your jaw shut.
-[inaudible] like, miracle.

00:13:06.552 --> 00:13:07.920 line:95%,end
JILL: Which you'll need
for the next 10 years.

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:10.422 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: It's called wiring your jaw shut.
-There are these wraps.

00:13:10.489 --> 00:13:14.093 line:95%,end
And it's like 12 different plant extracts.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.529 line:95%,end
And they're on like a piece of fabric.

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:18.697 line:95%,end
You, like, put the fabric on your belly.

00:13:18.764 --> 00:13:20.499 line:95%,end
And then you wrap yourself in cellophane.

00:13:20.599 --> 00:13:22.134 line:95%,end
And you leave it on for, like, 45 minutes.

00:13:22.468 --> 00:13:26.038 line:95%,end
And it tightens your skin
and flushes the toxins and stuff

00:13:26.138 --> 00:13:27.139 line:95%,end
out of your body.

00:13:27.206 --> 00:13:28.707 line:95%,end
Did it make everything tighter?

00:13:28.774 --> 00:13:29.942 line:95%,end
MELISSA: How long did you keep it?
-It seems to.

00:13:30.009 --> 00:13:32.044 line:95%,end
They say you should do it four times.

00:13:32.144 --> 00:13:34.980 line:95%,end
And then you just follow up
once a month, after that.

00:13:35.147 --> 00:13:37.550 line:5%,start
OK. My problem area starts about here.

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:40.519 line:5%,start
And it goes all the way
down to about the bottom.

00:13:40.619 --> 00:13:42.021 line:95%,end
I don't have a problem area.

00:13:42.121 --> 00:13:43.122 line:95%,end

When a guest choreographer
comes into town,

I think Chloe forgets all the time
how fabulous she really is.


00:37:31.749 --> 00:37:34.218 line:95%,end
I think Chlo's been
working really hard for that.

00:37:34.619 --> 00:37:36.954 line:95%,end

She pulled it out.

Yeah, she pulled it out.

backstage--

00:38:03.047 --> 00:38:04.482 line:95%,end
Could you see them from
where you were sitting?

00:38:04.582 --> 00:38:05.616 line:95%,end
- Absolutely.
- OK.

00:38:05.683 --> 00:38:07.418 line:95%,end
- She was coming out.
- No, no.

00:38:07.518 --> 00:38:10.254 line:95%,end
They were-- my point is I
could see everybody backstage.

00:38:10.321 --> 00:38:14.191 line:95%,end
ABBY: Her point always is,
is that it wasn't my kid.

00:38:14.292 --> 00:38:15.960 line:95%,end
- It was everybody's kid, too.
JILL: Well, and the point is--

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:17.228 line:95%,end
ABBY: So yell at them.
- The point is...

00:38:17.328 --> 00:38:19.497 line:95%,end
...you know only
selectively pick on my kid.

00:38:19.597 --> 00:38:20.765 line:95%,end
ABBY: No.

00:38:20.831 --> 00:38:22.466 line:95%,end
Every single one of them were back there
practicing their number.

00:38:22.533 --> 00:38:23.668 line:95%,end
I saw Chloe, too.

00:38:23.768 --> 00:38:26.203 line:95%,end
Look, if I can see you, you can see me.

00:38:26.304 --> 00:38:28.673 line:95%,end
So if they're in the wings and
they can see any of the judges

00:38:28.739 --> 00:38:30.841 line:95%,end
or any of the audience,
that means the judges

00:38:30.941 --> 00:38:32.076 line:95%,end
and the audience can see them.

00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:34.312 line:95%,end
JILL: Right.
- So you move way over here!

00:38:34.378 --> 00:38:36.213 line:95%,end
JILL: OK. But I'm telling you--
- You go out the door.

00:38:36.314 --> 00:38:37.782 line:95%,end
JILL: --not one
of those kids did that.

00:38:37.848 --> 00:38:39.784 line:95%,end
ABBY: Look, you
go over here and out the door

00:38:39.884 --> 00:38:41.385 line:95%,end

00:38:41.485 --> 00:38:43.688 line:95%,end
- Yes?
JILL: Yes.

00:38:43.788 --> 00:38:45.489 line:95%,end

- Abby, you're missing my point.

ABBY: --stage etiquette.

00:38:46.791 --> 00:38:47.958 line:95%,end
Yell at the kids.

00:38:48.025 --> 00:38:49.060 line:95%,end

- I will!

[music playing]

00:38:54.265 --> 00:38:55.299 line:95%,end
What?

00:38:55.399 --> 00:38:57.668 line:95%,end
ABBY: On Chloe's exit,
when she gave everybody

00:38:57.735 --> 00:38:58.869 line:95%,end
the fingers.

00:39:01.172 --> 00:39:03.607 line:95%,end
I think that she was, like,
being in character,

00:39:03.708 --> 00:39:05.309 line:95%,end
like rock and roll.
I don't think--

00:39:05.409 --> 00:39:07.812 line:95%,end
That was not the exit that she rehearsed.

00:39:08.112 --> 00:39:09.513 line:95%,end
ABBY: That is not
what she was given.

00:39:09.613 --> 00:39:12.149 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: You always talk about
giving the choreography something more.

00:39:12.216 --> 00:39:13.551 line:95%,end
- I don't think that that--
- Something more--

00:39:13.651 --> 00:39:17.221 line:95%,end
A shoulder,
an attitude, a look.

00:39:17.321 --> 00:39:19.256 line:95%,end
That certainly wasn't
what her intentions were.

00:39:19.357 --> 00:39:21.592 line:95%,end
Well, I don't know how many
rock concerts your kid's been

00:39:21.692 --> 00:39:23.361 line:95%,end
to in the '80s. But--

00:39:23.427 --> 00:39:26.030 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Never.
- She shouldn't know that.

00:39:26.097 --> 00:39:27.765 line:95%,end
She doesn't know that.
So that's why that's--

00:39:27.865 --> 00:39:29.800 line:95%,end
She did it.
She learned that somewhere, mommy.

00:39:31.769 --> 00:39:33.738 line:5%,start
I love the, like--

00:39:34.171 --> 00:39:35.740 line:95%,end
- OK.
- Like, the--

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:37.375 line:95%,end
OK.

00:39:38.042 --> 00:39:40.778 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Abby's just pissed
that Rachelle's choreography won.

00:39:40.878 --> 00:39:43.914 line:95%,end
She wanted to walk in here
and be, I told you so, you know,

00:39:44.014 --> 00:39:45.082 line:95%,end
that she was right.

00:39:45.182 --> 00:39:46.217 line:95%,end
And since she couldn't do that,

00:39:46.283 --> 00:39:49.120 line:95%,end
she had to find something
to come in here and tear apart,

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:51.255 line:95%,end
like my daughter's first
place winning solo.

00:39:51.355 --> 00:39:53.524 line:95%,end
Because that makes a lot of sense.

00:39:53.591 --> 00:39:55.693 line:95%,end
ABBY: Can we
all learn from her mistake?

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:57.661 line:95%,end
Do not change the choreography.

00:39:57.762 --> 00:39:59.597 line:95%,end
If I give you something to do on an exit,

00:39:59.697 --> 00:40:02.032 line:95%,end
if you're supposed to look back,
if you're supposed to blow a kiss,

00:40:02.099 --> 00:40:05.269 line:95%,end
if you flick your leg,
it's given to you.

00:40:05.369 --> 00:40:08.439 line:95%,end
It is given to you in rehearsal.

00:40:08.939 --> 00:40:11.075 line:95%,end
Well, girls, you got to work
with a dancer

00:40:11.208 --> 00:40:12.743 line:95%,end
that's been on Broadway.

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:15.312 line:95%,end
Hey, maybe someday, you're going
to be the dancer on Broadway

00:40:15.413 --> 00:40:18.382 line:95%,end
that comes to get to work
with a group of kids.

00:40:18.449 --> 00:40:19.617 line:95%,end
It's not an easy job.

00:40:19.717 --> 00:40:20.718 line:95%,end
It's not easy to get there.

00:40:20.785 --> 00:40:22.286 line:95%,end
I'm thrilled that we won.

00:40:22.386 --> 00:40:24.655 line:95%,end
But I want more from these
girls than just trophies.

00:40:24.755 --> 00:40:27.925 line:95%,end
I want them to have careers,
and long careers.

00:40:27.992 --> 00:40:29.126 line:95%,end
Look at Rachelle.

00:40:29.393 --> 00:40:31.529 line:95%,end
If she can do it, you can do it.

00:40:31.629 --> 00:40:34.398 line:95%,end
When my kids graduate from
the Abby Lee Dance Company,

00:40:34.465 --> 00:40:36.767 line:95%,end
they're ready to take on
the professional world

00:40:36.834 --> 00:40:38.936 line:95%,end
and earn a living as a dancer.

00:40:39.837 --> 00:40:44.809 line:95%,end
So ladies, there's a lesson
to be learned in each week.

00:40:44.909 --> 00:40:51.115 line:95%,end
And also, you're a little
bit closer to Mr. Bob Fosse.
