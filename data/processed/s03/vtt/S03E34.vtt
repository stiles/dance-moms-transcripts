ABBY: Previously on "Dance Moms".

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:04.971 line:5%,start
- So is Abby here?
- I don't know.

00:00:05.038 --> 00:00:06.706 line:5%,start
- ABBY: Gianna.
- Abby.

00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:09.976 line:5%,start
One, two, three, [inaudible].

00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:12.379 line:5%,start
I texted her and she said
that you will be fired

00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:14.714 line:5%,start
from this dance studio
if you choreograph that dance.

00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:16.516 line:5%,start
I don't care where the [bleep] she works.

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:18.051 line:5%,start
Oh. Oh. Oh.

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:20.387 line:5%,start
She has made it clear she doesn't care

00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:22.322 line:5%,start
about our kids or her team.

00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:24.557 line:5%,start
Brooke, there's nothing we can do.

00:00:24.624 --> 00:00:27.027 line:5%,start
Abby should have been here,
but she wasn't.

00:00:27.093 --> 00:00:28.128 line:5%,start
That was her choice.

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:29.796 line:5%,start
[mouthing] Thank you.

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:31.564 line:5%,start
ABBY: Coming up on "Dance Moms".

00:00:31.631 --> 00:00:32.832 line:5%,start
So I did talk to Abby.

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:34.467 line:5%,start
We're definitely competing this weekend.

00:00:34.968 --> 00:00:38.905 line:5%,start
CATHY: I need a dancer that
can beat Chloe this weekend.

00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:41.641 line:5%,start
Did Abby mention anything
about nationals, Melissa,

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:43.843 line:5%,start
- when you were there?
- ABBY: Listen to me.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.845 line:5%,start
I'm listening. You're the god. I know.

00:00:45.912 --> 00:00:47.213 line:5%,start
You make a point to tell all of us.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.682 line:5%,start
- [bleep] you. CHRISTI:
- Gianna, where's Abby?

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:52.452 line:5%,start
CATHY: So why have a choreographer
when you have dance teachers?

00:00:53.286 --> 00:00:55.622 line:5%,start
God, I hate this.

00:00:55.688 --> 00:00:58.158 line:5%,start
I hate it. I hate it.

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:01.795 line:95%,end
[MUSIC - NIKKO LOWE, "LIVING ON
THE DANCE FLOOR"]

00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:03.696 line:95%,end
NIKKO LOWE: (SINGING) Get up.

00:01:03.763 --> 00:01:05.198 line:95%,end
Get on the floor.

00:01:05.265 --> 00:01:08.668 line:95%,end
My world is with my girls.

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:11.137 line:95%,end
Living on the dance floor.

00:01:20.647 --> 00:01:22.682 line:95%,end
Good morning. Hello.

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:24.017 line:95%,end
- Melissa?
- Hi.

00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:26.319 line:95%,end
- Oh, hey.
- Don't you look fancy.

00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:28.621 line:95%,end
I stopped at Abby's house before pyramid

00:01:28.688 --> 00:01:30.290 line:5%,start
to see how she was doing.

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:32.625 line:5%,start
We have nationals in a few weeks
and we need her back

00:01:32.692 --> 00:01:33.726 line:95%,end
at the ALDC.

00:01:33.793 --> 00:01:36.296 line:95%,end
Well, my mom's, uh, nurses come today.

00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:37.197 line:95%,end
Oh, yeah.

00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:40.500 line:95%,end
So when you look at her,
you think she's healthy.

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:43.503 line:95%,end
She looks fine, but she's in so much pain.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.238 line:95%,end
Don't cry. Don't cry.

00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:47.273 line:95%,end
I know how much Abby loves her mom.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.910 line:95%,end
And to put on this brave face
is just crazy to me.

00:01:50.977 --> 00:01:53.580 line:95%,end
And she's the one that needs
to really have a big cry.

00:01:53.646 --> 00:01:55.248 line:95%,end
I don't know if I'm gonna be
in pyramid today.

00:01:55.315 --> 00:01:56.916 line:95%,end
Well, I have to tell you,
this past weekend,

00:01:57.083 --> 00:01:58.184 line:95%,end
I was sad you weren't there.

00:01:58.251 --> 00:02:00.620 line:95%,end
Maddie needs you back this week.

00:02:00.687 --> 00:02:02.989 line:95%,end
What Maddie needs and what Abby needs

00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:04.090 line:95%,end
are two different things.

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:05.925 line:95%,end
My mother needs me more than Maddie does.

00:02:05.992 --> 00:02:07.293 line:95%,end
Oh, yeah. But it's two weeks to nationals.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.562 line:95%,end
I think you can rest assured
with Maddie's record

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:11.731 line:95%,end
that she's gonna be performing
at nationals,

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:13.066 line:95%,end
Melissa. Don't worry about that.

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:15.902 line:95%,end
Melissa needs to understand,
all that mama drama,

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:17.270 line:95%,end
it stresses me out.

00:02:17.337 --> 00:02:21.307 line:5%,start
Now, as long
as Kelly is at that dance studio

00:02:21.407 --> 00:02:24.711 line:95%,end
causing everybody's stress,
I don't need to be there.

00:02:24.777 --> 00:02:26.179 line:95%,end
My mother comes first.

00:02:26.246 --> 00:02:28.281 line:95%,end
When I'm upset, she's upset.

00:02:28.348 --> 00:02:29.716 line:95%,end
And that's what you have to understand.

00:02:29.782 --> 00:02:31.618 line:95%,end
- I know. Are you kidding me?
- When I come home ranting and raving--

00:02:31.684 --> 00:02:32.852 line:95%,end
I know.

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:34.254 line:95%,end
--about Paige or about this or about that,

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.756 line:95%,end
ruining the numbers and looking so bad.

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:38.324 line:95%,end
I can't take it.

00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:40.560 line:95%,end
And you know
how my mother feels about Kelly.

00:02:40.627 --> 00:02:45.265 line:95%,end
Melissa, do you realize
that when my dad was dying

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:49.502 line:95%,end
in intensive care,
we kept my dad on life support

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.072 line:95%,end
- during the entire recital.
- Recital.

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:54.574 line:95%,end
I never spoke to him again.

00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:59.012 line:95%,end
I just need time
and that's what I don't have.

00:03:04.083 --> 00:03:05.652 line:95%,end
WOMAN: Hello.

00:03:05.718 --> 00:03:06.986 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Hi, guys.

00:03:07.053 --> 00:03:09.088 line:95%,end
Can I sit there, Kendall?
Honey, do you mind?

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:10.190 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Does anyone know

00:03:10.256 --> 00:03:12.458 line:95%,end
- if Abby is gonna here?
- I don't think she's coming.

00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:14.661 line:95%,end
She said that today,
that she's staying with her mom.

00:03:14.727 --> 00:03:16.796 line:95%,end
Does she know that today's the day
we would normally do pyramid?

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:19.332 line:5%,start
I think it's really strange
that Melissa's having

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:21.234 line:5%,start
secret meetings with Abby now.

00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:23.002 line:95%,end
I mean, why wouldn't
she have at least told

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:24.270 line:95%,end
the other moms she was going?

00:03:24.337 --> 00:03:26.706 line:95%,end
I don't know
if Abby really will even come back.

00:03:26.973 --> 00:03:28.408 line:95%,end
Hey, guys.

00:03:28.474 --> 00:03:30.543 line:95%,end
Girls, listen,
can you guys just go to studio A

00:03:30.643 --> 00:03:31.978 line:95%,end
- and start stretching?
- HOLLY: Super.


00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:33.046 line:5%,start
- OK.
- Go, go, go.

00:03:33.112 --> 00:03:35.515 line:5%,start
I finally spoke to Abby
and I'm in charge of the routines

00:03:35.582 --> 00:03:36.749 line:5%,start
again this week.

00:03:36.816 --> 00:03:38.484 line:95%,end
I hope I can pull off
another win without her.

00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:40.053 line:95%,end
So I did talk to Abby.

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:41.754 line:95%,end
We're definitely competing this weekend.

00:03:41.821 --> 00:03:44.123 line:95%,end
- WOMAN: OK.
- So do we know who's doing dances?

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.191 line:95%,end
Yes.

00:03:48.127 --> 00:03:49.295 line:95%,end
Chloe solo.

00:03:49.362 --> 00:03:50.830 line:95%,end
Oh, OK.

00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:52.332 line:95%,end
Abby already knows
that she's giving Maddie

00:03:52.398 --> 00:03:54.767 line:95%,end
a solo at nationals
but she isn't sure who else.

00:03:54.834 --> 00:03:57.337 line:95%,end
She wants me to work with Chloe
on the lyrical piece,

00:03:57.403 --> 00:03:58.571 line:95%,end
which is her best style.

00:03:58.638 --> 00:04:00.206 line:95%,end
So Christi better not have any complaints.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.109 line:95%,end
Group dance, I'm guessing with everyone.

00:04:03.176 --> 00:04:04.911 line:95%,end
- I haven't heard yet.
- =OK.

00:04:04.978 --> 00:04:06.746 line:95%,end
It's a dark contemporary routine.

00:04:06.813 --> 00:04:11.851 line:95%,end
And, um, no Maddie solo,
but she said she wants

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:14.487 line:95%,end
- to feature Maddie in the group.
- OK. OK.

00:04:14.554 --> 00:04:16.289 line:95%,end
And Asia and Kenzie duet.

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.626 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Oh, that'll be good.

00:04:19.692 --> 00:04:22.061 line:95%,end
So that's only three numbers.

00:04:22.128 --> 00:04:24.297 line:5%,start
I'm happy for the other girls this week,

00:04:24.364 --> 00:04:27.000 line:5%,start
but I have to be honest, I'm really mad

00:04:27.066 --> 00:04:28.935 line:95%,end
that Kendall doesn't have a solo
this week.

00:04:29.002 --> 00:04:32.772 line:95%,end
With only a few weeks till nationals,
these solos are everything.

00:04:33.072 --> 00:04:35.708 line:95%,end
And Kendall needs to prove to Abby
that she can handle

00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:37.644 line:95%,end
competing on a national level.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.414 line:95%,end
And I don't know how she can do that
with no solo and no Abby.

00:04:41.514 --> 00:04:44.917 line:95%,end
Is she coming this weekend or ever?
Or this week?

00:04:44.984 --> 00:04:47.253 line:95%,end
- Is she coming today?
- She didn't say she wasn't.

00:04:47.387 --> 00:04:48.888 line:95%,end
You're just gonna start rehearsal,

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:50.456 line:95%,end
no pyramid, no nothing.

00:04:50.523 --> 00:04:52.525 line:95%,end
- This was pyramid.
- WOMAN: Pyramid.

00:04:52.592 --> 00:04:54.327 line:95%,end
Yay.

00:04:59.165 --> 00:05:00.600 line:95%,end
CATHY: Hey, everybody.

00:05:00.667 --> 00:05:02.368 line:95%,end
KIDS: Hi.

00:05:02.435 --> 00:05:06.673 line:95%,end
It's nice to see my special teams
and my special moms.

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:08.775 line:95%,end
And, Zack, you're back.

00:05:08.841 --> 00:05:10.743 line:95%,end
You know,
that's kinda like the battle cry.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:11.911 line:95%,end
Zack is back.

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:14.514 line:5%,start
Zack has been off working professionally

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.416 line:95%,end
and now he's back with our team.

00:05:16.516 --> 00:05:19.085 line:95%,end
With him back, hopefully we can beat Abby.

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:21.087 line:95%,end
I'm not the least bit concerned

00:05:21.354 --> 00:05:23.656 line:95%,end
that Anthony isn't here right now.

00:05:23.723 --> 00:05:25.958 line:95%,end
I think he was an avalanche.

00:05:26.025 --> 00:05:28.428 line:95%,end
He was a accident waiting to happen.

00:05:28.561 --> 00:05:31.130 line:95%,end
Anthony has not produced
a win for me in a while

00:05:31.197 --> 00:05:32.865 line:95%,end
and I'm a little frustrated by that.

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:37.537 line:95%,end
So without Anthony being here,
I feel as though I can focus more

00:05:37.603 --> 00:05:39.906 line:95%,end
on nationals,
which is right down the road.

00:05:39.972 --> 00:05:42.208 line:95%,end
And I don't have
to play referee between him

00:05:42.275 --> 00:05:43.843 line:95%,end
and the parents and the stress level.

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:45.578 line:95%,end
You want to see me in your face?

00:05:45.645 --> 00:05:46.913 line:95%,end
You will never be in my face.

00:05:47.647 --> 00:05:49.248 line:95%,end
Let me go for where I'm going, please.

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:50.683 line:95%,end
CATHY: Your choreography is in jeopardy.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.685 line:95%,end
- He's a puppet. This is a puppet.
- CATHY: He looks dumb.

00:05:52.752 --> 00:05:54.053 line:95%,end
- CATHY: No.
- Yes.

00:05:54.721 --> 00:06:00.793 line:95%,end
So last time that we competed,
we did a seasons contemporary number

00:06:05.898 --> 00:06:07.767 line:95%,end
and we got rained on.

00:06:08.334 --> 00:06:09.602 line:95%,end
We didn't win.

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:14.073 line:95%,end
The last competition,
we lost to Abby again.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:18.010 line:95%,end
And with nationals
not being but a few weeks away,

00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:21.614 line:95%,end
it's essential that we have a good showing
at this competition.

00:06:21.681 --> 00:06:27.487 line:95%,end
Let's begin,
starting with my bottom Apple, Zack.

00:06:27.553 --> 00:06:28.888 line:95%,end
No surprises there.

00:06:28.955 --> 00:06:31.591 line:95%,end
It's hard to be at the top
when you aren't with us performing.

00:06:31.657 --> 00:06:33.459 line:95%,end
You're wonderful.
You can move up.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.530 line:95%,end
Next, we have Mary.

00:06:39.165 --> 00:06:41.768 line:95%,end
Mary struggled a little bit
the last time that we saw you.

00:06:41.834 --> 00:06:43.936 line:95%,end
We talked about her port de bras arms.

00:06:44.437 --> 00:06:46.339 line:5%,start
Mary is a beautiful dancer

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:49.442 line:5%,start
and I think Kathy is crazy for putting her
on the bottom of the Apple tree.

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:51.077 line:95%,end
It's an insult to the dance community.

00:06:51.144 --> 00:06:53.513 line:95%,end
Everybody that sees Mary
knows she's trained.

00:06:53.579 --> 00:06:54.614 line:95%,end
She shouldn't be there.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.882 line:95%,end
CATHY: Let's move on.

00:06:57.283 --> 00:06:59.285 line:95%,end
Kaya, you're like in the middle.

00:06:59.352 --> 00:07:03.156 line:95%,end
You can no longer be the one
that's not professionally trained,


00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:06.159 line:95%,end
be the one
that doesn't have technical classes.

00:07:06.225 --> 00:07:10.163 line:5%,start
Excuse me that I couldn't afford
to put my daughter in $1,000 classes,

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:12.532 line:95%,end
but I've never used that as an excuse.

00:07:12.598 --> 00:07:14.801 line:95%,end
I'll don't need excuses.
Nicaya's the best.

00:07:14.867 --> 00:07:15.935 line:95%,end
CATHY: Let's move on.

00:07:16.002 --> 00:07:20.106 line:95%,end
OK. So Had, I'm being
a little bit more aggressive this week.

00:07:20.173 --> 00:07:22.708 line:95%,end
It's been a while since I've gotten a win.

00:07:22.775 --> 00:07:26.446 line:95%,end
There's no room for error--
none.

00:07:26.512 --> 00:07:29.282 line:5%,start
I think Hadley should be at the top
of the apple tree.

00:07:29.348 --> 00:07:32.084 line:95%,end
I mean, she works the hardest,
I work the hardest,

00:07:32.151 --> 00:07:34.387 line:95%,end
and together, we should be rewarded.

00:07:34.454 --> 00:07:35.988 line:95%,end
CATHY: It's easy to figure out

00:07:36.055 --> 00:07:38.691 line:95%,end
that our leading man this week is Lucas.

00:07:38.758 --> 00:07:42.528 line:95%,end
Lucas, being at the top
makes you that guy

00:07:42.595 --> 00:07:44.363 line:95%,end
who has to go into battle this week

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:46.032 line:95%,end
and lead your team.

00:07:46.098 --> 00:07:47.900 line:95%,end
Nationals are approaching fast

00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:50.603 line:95%,end
and I need to see who can lead me
to a victory this week

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:51.671 line:95%,end
and at nationals.

00:07:51.737 --> 00:07:54.407 line:95%,end
I'm hoping that Lucas is the guy
that can do that.

00:07:54.507 --> 00:07:57.143 line:95%,end
This week, we are going
to Charleston, West Virginia

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:59.412 line:95%,end
for the Masters of Dance Competition.

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:03.216 line:95%,end
I know that the Abby Lee Dance Company
will be at the competition this week.

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:06.686 line:95%,end
Our group dance
is going to be Rise of the Phoenix.

00:08:06.752 --> 00:08:09.755 line:95%,end
And I'm expecting you
to just rise up on stage

00:08:09.856 --> 00:08:11.290 line:95%,end
and just capitalize.

00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:16.729 line:95%,end
I know first handedly,
because I sold on social media

00:08:16.829 --> 00:08:20.766 line:95%,end
and maybe some of you did as well,
Chloe is doing a solo

00:08:20.833 --> 00:08:22.101 line:95%,end
at the competition this week.

00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:25.671 line:95%,end
I think that Chloe is not as strong
as she used to be.

00:08:25.938 --> 00:08:29.876 line:95%,end
I need a dancer that can
beat Chloe this weekend.

00:08:29.942 --> 00:08:34.747 line:95%,end
My solo is going to be given to Zack.

00:08:34.814 --> 00:08:36.449 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:38.618 line:95%,end
ZACK: I'm so happy
to have a solo this week.

00:08:38.684 --> 00:08:40.086 line:95%,end
I've beat Chloe in the past.

00:08:40.253 --> 00:08:42.221 line:5%,start
And with Kathy
doing my choreography this week,

00:08:42.288 --> 00:08:43.823 line:5%,start
and there's no more fights
with Anthony,

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:45.291 line:95%,end
I mean, I think I can pull out a win.

00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:47.560 line:95%,end
CATHY: It's been a long day already.
We need to work.

00:08:49.862 --> 00:08:52.798 line:5%,start
GIANNA: Passe away.

00:08:52.865 --> 00:08:56.002 line:5%,start
[MUSIC - REBEKAH WHITE, "I KNOW
IT'S TOO LATE"]

00:08:56.068 --> 00:08:59.138 line:95%,end
Chloe is doing a lyrical solo
this week called Too Late.

00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:02.642 line:95%,end
REBEKAH WHITE: (SINGING) Your
face, it haunts me in the dark.

00:09:02.708 --> 00:09:04.644 line:95%,end
I can't see just what you are.

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:06.512 line:95%,end
GIANNA: Nationals
are only a few weeks away

00:09:06.579 --> 00:09:08.915 line:95%,end
and Abby doesn't know
if Chloe deserves a solo.

00:09:08.981 --> 00:09:10.950 line:95%,end
She has to nail this routine this week.

00:09:11.017 --> 00:09:12.485 line:95%,end
I don't know what we're gonna do.

00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:14.854 line:95%,end
I mean, doesn't Abby say,
I'm watching you for nationals.

00:09:14.921 --> 00:09:16.122 line:95%,end
I'm watching you. I'm watching you.

00:09:16.188 --> 00:09:18.090 line:95%,end
But you're not watching
anyone for nationals

00:09:18.157 --> 00:09:19.258 line:95%,end
'cause you're not here.

00:09:19.325 --> 00:09:20.760 line:95%,end
How many more weeks do we have
before we go to nationals?

00:09:20.826 --> 00:09:22.228 line:95%,end
- Three weeks.
- It would be nice

00:09:22.295 --> 00:09:25.565 line:95%,end
if she can make an informed decision
based on things that she has observed.

00:09:25.631 --> 00:09:28.701 line:5%,start
I think it's unfair that Abby
determines who is going to get solos

00:09:28.768 --> 00:09:31.671 line:95%,end
at nationals based on the performances
over the last few weeks.

00:09:31.737 --> 00:09:33.072 line:95%,end
Abby isn't even here.

00:09:33.139 --> 00:09:35.174 line:95%,end
The girls
certainly aren't performing at their best,

00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:36.943 line:95%,end
and things here are really chaotic.

00:09:39.779 --> 00:09:40.980 line:95%,end
And then flip.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.882 line:95%,end
Yes. That's it.

00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:45.618 line:95%,end
Did Abby mention anything
about nationals, Melissa,

00:09:45.685 --> 00:09:46.953 line:95%,end
when you were there?

00:09:47.186 --> 00:09:50.690 line:95%,end
Um, nationals-- I don't know.
Did she?

00:09:50.856 --> 00:09:53.359 line:95%,end
She's gonna be performing at nationals,
Melissa. Don't worry about that.

00:09:53.859 --> 00:09:59.031 line:95%,end
She said that Maddie
probably would have a solo at nationals.

00:10:00.099 --> 00:10:01.801 line:95%,end
I mean, who--
I don't know.

00:10:01.867 --> 00:10:03.302 line:95%,end
So why do we sit here and pretend

00:10:03.402 --> 00:10:06.172 line:95%,end
we want to go to nationals
when these guys already know

00:10:06.372 --> 00:10:07.840 line:95%,end
- who's going to nationals.
- CHRISTI: I don't know.

00:10:07.907 --> 00:10:10.242 line:95%,end
- I mean, really.
- She said probably.

00:10:10.309 --> 00:10:13.412 line:95%,end
We all know that
Maddie will have a solo at nationals

00:10:13.479 --> 00:10:14.513 line:95%,end
and that's [bleep].

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.817 line:95%,end
Once again,
Melissa has a secret meeting with Abby

00:10:17.984 --> 00:10:20.186 line:95%,end
and secretly gets Maddie ahead

00:10:20.252 --> 00:10:22.488 line:95%,end
and the rest of us are left in the dark.

00:10:22.555 --> 00:10:25.224 line:95%,end
I'm not gonna sit here pretend
that my kid has a shot

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:28.461 line:95%,end
of having a solo at nationals
when you know you're getting--

00:10:28.527 --> 00:10:29.829 line:95%,end
- I don't know-- wait, wait wait.
- JILL: Yes, you do.


00:10:36.135 --> 00:10:38.738 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: No, I am.
I'm speaking for you, too.

00:10:38.804 --> 00:10:40.906 line:5%,start
With Abby being MIA from the studio,

00:10:40.973 --> 00:10:42.575 line:5%,start
the moms decided to take a little break,

00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:43.909 line:5%,start
sneak away, get some lunch.

00:10:43.976 --> 00:10:46.245 line:95%,end
Plus, we really need
to celebrate Kelly's return,

00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:48.214 line:95%,end
and now's as good of a time as ever.

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.583 line:95%,end
I'm just glad
that you've rejoined the team.

00:10:50.683 --> 00:10:52.084 line:95%,end
- It's good to have you back.
- KELLY: Thank you.

00:10:52.151 --> 00:10:53.352 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I don't care
what anyone says.

00:10:53.419 --> 00:10:55.921 line:5%,start
I can take whatever Abby wants
to dish out to me,

00:10:55.988 --> 00:10:58.190 line:5%,start
I just don't want her
to take it out on anybody else.

00:10:58.257 --> 00:11:01.093 line:95%,end
I feel bad. Abby's not coming
because my kids are here.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.863 line:95%,end
If Abby's not gonna be here
because of my kids,

00:11:03.929 --> 00:11:08.300 line:95%,end
I will leave because I'm not taking
any training away from your kids.

00:11:08.367 --> 00:11:10.302 line:95%,end
Here's what my problem is,
she's gonna come,

00:11:10.369 --> 00:11:13.472 line:95%,end
when she does come back,
with a list of excuses there.

00:11:13.539 --> 00:11:15.975 line:95%,end
And none of them are gonna be good
because they're all gonna be a lie

00:11:16.042 --> 00:11:17.510 line:95%,end
because we know
why she wasn't there.

00:11:17.576 --> 00:11:23.249 line:95%,end
She admitted that she was not coming back
until my family was gone.

00:11:23.349 --> 00:11:24.350 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Does anyone else worry

00:11:24.417 --> 00:11:28.087 line:95%,end
about Abby fuming about Brooke
doing a solo last week?

00:11:28.154 --> 00:11:31.090 line:95%,end
I think she's gonna be pissed off
but I don't think--

00:11:31.157 --> 00:11:35.761 line:95%,end
I think she's coming in guns blazing
and we're all in her cross-hairs.

00:11:42.868 --> 00:11:44.637 line:5%,start
Question, who wants Abby
to be here today?

00:11:44.704 --> 00:11:45.705 line:95%,end
Me.

00:11:45.771 --> 00:11:48.007 line:95%,end
I'm ready for Abby
to just randomly walk into rehearsal

00:11:48.074 --> 00:11:51.010 line:95%,end
and be like, "You're doing this wrong.
You're doing this wrong".

00:11:51.077 --> 00:11:52.745 line:95%,end
HOLLY: I think
we're all waiting for that.

00:11:52.812 --> 00:11:53.979 line:95%,end
See.

00:11:54.046 --> 00:11:56.982 line:5%,start
Another day of rehearsal
and Abby's not here again.

00:11:57.049 --> 00:11:58.350 line:5%,start
I'm getting really worried.

00:11:58.417 --> 00:12:02.455 line:95%,end
We really need her here right
before nationals, no question about it.

00:12:02.521 --> 00:12:05.191 line:95%,end
- HOLLY: Hi.
- Ready girls? Let's go.

00:12:06.058 --> 00:12:09.595 line:5%,start
Abby isn't here this week,
but we need to keep things going as usual.

00:12:09.662 --> 00:12:11.197 line:5%,start
The girls have a competition

00:12:11.263 --> 00:12:13.799 line:5%,start
and they have to keep practicing
their routines as if she were here.

00:12:13.866 --> 00:12:17.870 line:5%,start
One, two, three, four, five, six.

00:12:17.937 --> 00:12:19.972 line:95%,end
Do you guys think
Abby's gonna show up today?

00:12:20.039 --> 00:12:21.774 line:95%,end
Wanting or needing Abby here
is irrelevant.

00:12:21.841 --> 00:12:23.109 line:95%,end
I think she should be here.

00:12:23.175 --> 00:12:24.643 line:95%,end
I really think she should be here.

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:25.978 line:95%,end
KELLY: Maybe I should
take a piece of my donut.

00:12:26.045 --> 00:12:27.980 line:95%,end
Oh my god, we could
leave a trail of hamburgers

00:12:28.047 --> 00:12:32.818 line:95%,end
from the house to the studio
if we want to get her back.

00:12:32.885 --> 00:12:34.854 line:95%,end
- That's perfect.
- We could it--

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.623 line:95%,end
a donut, a burger, a donut.

00:12:37.723 --> 00:12:39.225 line:95%,end
Maybe a chicken nugget here or there.

00:12:39.458 --> 00:12:40.459 line:95%,end
I am going to burn--

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:43.596 line:95%,end
- At least you'll be next to me.
- I'll be right beside you.

00:12:48.968 --> 00:12:51.837 line:5%,start
CATHY: So why don't we start
to develop an opening.

00:12:51.904 --> 00:12:54.640 line:5%,start
Five, six, seven, go.

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:58.310 line:5%,start
One, two, three, four, and five.

00:12:58.377 --> 00:13:00.913 line:5%,start
The group number this week
is called Phoenix Rising.

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:03.215 line:5%,start
And I think that is pretty appropriate

00:13:03.282 --> 00:13:05.885 line:5%,start
because the last time we didn't win

00:13:05.951 --> 00:13:09.688 line:95%,end
and we want to rise up
out of the ashes to be victorious.


00:13:09.755 --> 00:13:12.458 line:95%,end
Four and up, six, seven.

00:13:12.525 --> 00:13:13.559 line:95%,end
OK.
Don't move.

00:13:13.626 --> 00:13:15.227 line:95%,end
Who needs Anthony anyhow?

00:13:15.294 --> 00:13:17.963 line:95%,end
It's my dance studio
and I'm perfectly capable

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:19.598 line:95%,end
of leading this team to victory.

00:13:19.665 --> 00:13:21.901 line:95%,end
I'm feeling like that push,
there's no resistance.

00:13:21.967 --> 00:13:23.903 line:95%,end
Yeah.
Get angry about it.

00:13:23.969 --> 00:13:27.239 line:95%,end
That's Anthony's face.
Push it down in the ground.

00:13:27.306 --> 00:13:31.744 line:5%,start
With Anthony gone, this is my chance
to step up and help this team.

00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:34.947 line:5%,start
We spotlight the boys first
and then we count the girls in.

00:13:35.014 --> 00:13:38.017 line:95%,end
- The girls might circle around the boys.
- Sure.

00:13:38.284 --> 00:13:41.220 line:95%,end
I want this number to be perfect
because nothing would

00:13:41.287 --> 00:13:45.758 line:95%,end
make me happier than beating Abby
after the way she's treated Hadley.

00:13:45.858 --> 00:13:47.393 line:95%,end
Five, six, same thing.

00:13:47.459 --> 00:13:50.129 line:95%,end
Hit, hit, back, front, and stop.

00:13:50.196 --> 00:13:51.430 line:95%,end
So much better.

00:13:51.497 --> 00:13:56.101 line:95%,end
Walk, walk, back, front, ball change.
Lift, lift-- listen.

00:13:56.168 --> 00:13:58.404 line:95%,end
OK, stop.
The whole group gets to start over

00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:59.772 line:95%,end
because I said we're moving on.

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:01.974 line:95%,end
Everyone heard that but one person.

00:14:02.041 --> 00:14:04.577 line:95%,end
- Make every move...
- ...count.

00:14:04.643 --> 00:14:09.415 line:95%,end
Ready? Five, six, seven, eight,
walk, walk, back, front, ball change.

00:14:09.481 --> 00:14:12.451 line:95%,end
I'm happy if Yvette wants to pitch in
with group rehearsal

00:14:12.551 --> 00:14:14.620 line:95%,end
but, ultimately, everybody on this team

00:14:14.687 --> 00:14:17.590 line:95%,end
has to understand it's my dance studio

00:14:17.656 --> 00:14:21.327 line:95%,end
and it's me who makes the final decisions.

00:14:21.393 --> 00:14:25.264 line:95%,end
Reach, reach, up, down, one, two, three.

- I'm very proud of you.

00:31:10.869 --> 00:31:12.203 line:95%,end
Good.
Good.

00:31:12.871 --> 00:31:15.306 line:95%,end
CATHY: Yeah, Zack.

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:17.642 line:95%,end
How did you feel about that?

00:31:17.709 --> 00:31:19.844 line:95%,end
- Good.
- It was amazing.

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:28.253 line:95%,end
- HOLLY: Don't we go this way?
- YVETTE: Leave it on the dance floor.

00:31:28.319 --> 00:31:29.787 line:95%,end
Leave it on the dance floor, kids.

00:31:29.854 --> 00:31:32.924 line:95%,end
- How many of you are dance teachers here?
- I am.

00:31:32.991 --> 00:31:35.059 line:95%,end
So why have a choreographer
when you have dance teachers?

00:31:35.126 --> 00:31:36.861 line:95%,end
Well, we found out that
we don't need one now.

00:31:36.928 --> 00:31:39.864 line:95%,end
Actually, Cathy did all choreography.

00:31:43.401 --> 00:31:47.338 line:5%,start
I cannot believe
that Gina D told the ALDC team

00:31:47.405 --> 00:31:49.374 line:95%,end
that I had nothing to do
with this dance routine.

00:31:49.574 --> 00:31:52.010 line:95%,end
I'm done. I'm done.

00:31:58.016 --> 00:31:59.884 line:95%,end
YVETTE: God, you make me so mad.

00:31:59.951 --> 00:32:02.020 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Yvette,
you can sit with us if you'd like.

00:32:02.086 --> 00:32:04.856 line:95%,end
I'll even let you sit by me
because this is ridiculous.

00:32:04.923 --> 00:32:07.725 line:95%,end
God, I hate this.

00:32:07.792 --> 00:32:10.161 line:95%,end
I hate it. I hate it.


00:32:18.303 --> 00:32:19.837 line:95%,end
Why did she say Cathy first?

00:32:19.904 --> 00:32:21.739 line:95%,end
What [bleep] thing did Cathy do?

00:32:21.806 --> 00:32:24.175 line:95%,end
Cathy didn't spend a second
on this routine.

00:32:24.242 --> 00:32:25.410 line:95%,end
OK.

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:27.045 line:5%,start
I feel so pushed aside.

00:32:27.111 --> 00:32:30.214 line:5%,start
I feel like Gina
just gave Cathy all the credit

00:32:30.949 --> 00:32:32.550 line:95%,end
and I got no respect.

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:35.853 line:95%,end
- HOLLY: Well, that was a lively bunch.
- KELLY: I'm confused.

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.555 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Well,
I think the issue was Yvette

00:32:37.622 --> 00:32:42.226 line:95%,end
did the choreography and Cathy said
she did the choreography.

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:45.897 line:95%,end
It sounded like Yvette did it
and Cathy took the credit for it.

00:32:46.097 --> 00:32:48.333 line:5%,start
This is so embarrassing because our enemy

00:32:48.399 --> 00:32:50.969 line:5%,start
is seeing us fall apart
right before we go on.

00:32:51.035 --> 00:32:53.404 line:95%,end
I wish Yvette would have
just kept it together

00:32:53.471 --> 00:32:56.207 line:95%,end
and not shown our weakness to everyone.

00:32:56.274 --> 00:32:58.843 line:95%,end
I don't know, this crazy train.

00:33:01.512 --> 00:33:03.815 line:95%,end
Why did she do-- why did Gina do that?

00:33:03.881 --> 00:33:05.249 line:95%,end
Why would you do that?

00:33:05.316 --> 00:33:06.551 line:95%,end
She did say your name.

00:33:06.617 --> 00:33:08.586 line:95%,end
Because I even said to her
to say your name first.

00:33:08.653 --> 00:33:09.921 line:95%,end
You want to know
why I walked away too soon?

00:33:09.988 --> 00:33:11.022 line:95%,end
I get worked up.

00:33:11.089 --> 00:33:12.256 line:95%,end
You know why?

00:33:12.323 --> 00:33:14.525 line:95%,end
Because it's a piece of me that's on stage

00:33:14.592 --> 00:33:16.227 line:95%,end
because I'm so passionate.

00:33:16.294 --> 00:33:18.262 line:95%,end
That hurts my feelings.

00:33:18.329 --> 00:33:20.198 line:95%,end
CATHY: I thought by getting rid of Anthony

00:33:20.264 --> 00:33:23.434 line:5%,start
that I would be getting rid of the drama
but boy was I wrong.

00:33:23.501 --> 00:33:26.104 line:5%,start
I've traded in yelling for tears.

00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:31.776 line:95%,end
I don't have time
to waste on a grown woman crying.

00:33:31.843 --> 00:33:35.880 line:95%,end
I have better things to worry about
and that's beating ALDC.

00:33:35.947 --> 00:33:38.082 line:95%,end
YVETTE: Let's go kick their ass.

00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:39.951 line:95%,end
CATHY: Yvette,
we can't walk in here crying.

00:33:40.018 --> 00:33:41.019 line:95%,end

Hush, hush.

It's only a bruise.

And the group that candy Apple has--

You know what, Yvette?

You better take this poncho
because any minute now

- Bye.

00:39:01.505 --> 00:39:04.742 line:95%,end

Aren't you proud of them?
They looked great.

You would have been really proud of them.

I don't know, guys.

Wait a minute.
But you know what?

Stay focused.

Hell yes.

00:40:41.272 --> 00:40:43.808 line:95%,end
We were by far so much more intent

00:40:43.874 --> 00:40:46.644 line:95%,end
and strong than their routine today.

00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:48.913 line:95%,end
We don't have a winning team.

00:40:48.979 --> 00:40:50.181 line:95%,end
We have no nationals.

00:40:50.247 --> 00:40:52.183 line:95%,end
There's no nationals for us.

00:40:52.249 --> 00:40:54.251 line:95%,end
I guess when we all leave here today,

00:40:54.385 --> 00:40:57.188 line:95%,end
it's going to be, will we ever come back?

00:40:58.989 --> 00:41:00.191 line:95%,end

00:41:18.175 --> 00:41:20.344 line:5%,start
Don't get nervous.
Listen, do it for you.

00:41:20.411 --> 00:41:21.579 line:5%,start
Don't do it for her.

00:41:21.645 --> 00:41:24.515 line:5%,start
