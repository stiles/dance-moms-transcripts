ABBY LEE MILLER (VOICEOVER):
Previously on "Dance Moms."

00:00:03.336 --> 00:00:06.206 line:5%,start
ABBY LEE MILLER:
Sophia, you were doing a solo.

00:00:07.607 --> 00:00:10.744 line:5%,start
WOMAN 1: Everybody knows
that Melissa will do whatever it takes

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.013 line:5%,start
to have her kids number one
in Abby's eyes.

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:14.381 line:5%,start
What are you people doing?

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:16.316 line:5%,start
I've probably cleaned
this place up 12 times.

00:00:17.517 --> 00:00:19.619 line:5%,start
There are too many people in this dance.

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:21.788 line:5%,start
Brooke, you're out.

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:25.658 line:5%,start
Chloe is your student.
You are a plagiarist,

00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:27.694 line:5%,start
because that little girl
is somebody else's student

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:29.329 line:5%,start
and you just put her name on her back.

00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:32.866 line:5%,start
You're ridiculous. Chloe was awful today.

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:36.169 line:5%,start
ABBY LEE MILLER (VOICEOVER):
Coming up on "Dance Moms."

00:00:36.236 --> 00:00:37.837 line:5%,start
Sophia is on top of the pyramid

00:00:37.904 --> 00:00:39.372 line:5%,start
and she's not even here.

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:44.878 line:5%,start
My next routine will be a duet
with Maddie and Kendall.

00:00:45.578 --> 00:00:47.514 line:5%,start
What did you think about the duet?

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.049 line:5%,start
Not happy about that, but...

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:52.285 line:5%,start
Abby told me last night
that you weren't happy about doing

00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:53.553 line:5%,start
a duet with Kendall.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.388 line:5%,start
You can believe whatever
you want to, Jill.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:58.525 line:5%,start
ABBY LEE MILLER:
Kendall, are you going to admit

00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:00.760 line:5%,start
that you screwed the whole dance up
and that you were off?

00:01:00.827 --> 00:01:03.997 line:5%,start
You have picked on her
the entire week about it.

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:05.298 line:5%,start
Kiss my butt.

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:08.201 line:5%,start
[music continuing]

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:10.570 line:95%,end
(SINGING) Get up.

00:01:10.637 --> 00:01:12.539 line:95%,end
Get on the floor.

00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:18.011 line:95%,end
My world is with my girls
living on the dance floor.

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:27.687 line:5%,start
ABBY LEE MILLER:
Come on, ladies, let's go.

00:01:31.057 --> 00:01:32.158 line:95%,end
All righty.

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:37.397 line:95%,end
We went to Youngstown, Ohio
to Intensity Dance. We won.

00:01:37.464 --> 00:01:41.134 line:95%,end
ANNOUNCER: Highest scoring group,
Red Carpet Special.

00:01:43.136 --> 00:01:44.270 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: We should have won.

00:01:44.337 --> 00:01:46.573 line:95%,end
You're national champions.

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:48.575 line:95%,end
Let's move on to the pyramid.

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:50.510 line:95%,end
I have Chloe.

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:54.347 line:95%,end
Chloe, remembering your choreography,

00:01:54.414 --> 00:01:56.149 line:95%,end
that is what you need to work on.

00:01:56.816 --> 00:01:57.984 line:95%,end
Write it down.

00:01:58.051 --> 00:02:00.487 line:95%,end
Maybe if you write it out, it'll sink in.

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:02.088 line:95%,end
Try that.

00:02:02.155 --> 00:02:03.890 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: This week, Abby has Chloe
at the bottom of the pyramid

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:05.258 line:95%,end
because she forgot her solo.

00:02:05.325 --> 00:02:06.426 line:5%,start
And you know what?

00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:08.628 line:5%,start
For once, I can't really argue with Abby

00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:11.564 line:5%,start
because Chloe did forget her solo,
and she's getting older

00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:14.267 line:95%,end
and she needs to take responsibility
for her actions.

00:02:14.334 --> 00:02:15.502 line:95%,end
She forgot.

00:02:16.603 --> 00:02:19.005 line:95%,end
Next, Mia.

00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:23.309 line:95%,end
Mia, you don't apply the corrections.

00:02:23.376 --> 00:02:24.611 line:95%,end
That's what you need to do.

00:02:24.677 --> 00:02:25.945 line:95%,end
Try writing them down.

00:02:27.213 --> 00:02:28.047 line:95%,end
Next.

00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:30.016 line:95%,end
Mackenzie.

00:02:30.083 --> 00:02:31.951 line:95%,end
MacKenzie,
when I took you out of the group,

00:02:32.018 --> 00:02:34.354 line:95%,end
I gave you this cute little part to do.

00:02:34.721 --> 00:02:37.824 line:95%,end
And thank goodness it was humorous.

00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:41.127 line:95%,end
Because had they started
timing our number,

00:02:41.194 --> 00:02:42.729 line:95%,end
we would have been disqualified,

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:46.199 line:95%,end
and the Abby Lee Dance Company
is not going to get disqualified.

00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:49.736 line:95%,end
All she had to do was grab this rope

00:02:49.802 --> 00:02:51.771 line:95%,end
and pull the carpet across the stage.

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:53.306 line:95%,end
She kept getting it stuck.

00:02:53.373 --> 00:02:56.342 line:5%,start
I will never forgive Mackenzie
for what she did.

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:59.012 line:5%,start
She made a mockery
of the beginning of that routine.

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:01.948 line:95%,end
You will not be in the group
numbers going forward,

00:03:03.416 --> 00:03:06.352 line:95%,end
not until it's appropriate for you.
Understood?

00:03:07.587 --> 00:03:10.089 line:95%,end
And Paige.

00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:12.992 line:95%,end
You got the featured part.

00:03:13.726 --> 00:03:15.995 line:95%,end
You had the big jump, the tilt, whap.

00:03:16.596 --> 00:03:18.464 line:95%,end
You could have made that fabulous,

00:03:18.765 --> 00:03:20.200 line:95%,end
but you didn't do that.

00:03:21.768 --> 00:03:25.672 line:95%,end
You were given an opportunity,
and instead of running with it,

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:27.507 line:95%,end
it was mediocre.

00:03:28.074 --> 00:03:30.577 line:95%,end
KELLY: I think Abby takes her frustration
out on the kids.

00:03:30.643 --> 00:03:34.013 line:95%,end
Like if Abby's mad at me,
she takes it out on Paige.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.715 line:5%,start
Just because I don't want to be there,

00:03:35.782 --> 00:03:38.284 line:5%,start
that should not be any reflection
onto Paige.

00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:40.520 line:95%,end
Next. Maddie.

00:03:42.355 --> 00:03:43.590 line:95%,end
You were good.

00:03:46.392 --> 00:03:48.461 line:95%,end
I noticed you have the Sophia hairdo.

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:54.100 line:95%,end
How about we have the Sophia energy,

00:03:54.467 --> 00:03:57.470 line:95%,end
the Sophia turns,
and not worry about the hairdo?

00:03:57.937 --> 00:03:59.672 line:95%,end
WOMAN:
I think there's enough pressure on Maddie

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.541 line:95%,end
without being compared to Sophia,

00:04:01.608 --> 00:04:03.443 line:95%,end
but now I know how the other moms feel

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:05.545 line:95%,end
when Abby does it to their children.

00:04:05.612 --> 00:04:07.347 line:95%,end
Next. Kendall.

00:04:07.413 --> 00:04:08.748 line:95%,end
You were in the front.

00:04:08.815 --> 00:04:11.584 line:95%,end
You were given a correction 100 times.

00:04:13.853 --> 00:04:15.088 line:95%,end
Did you keep up with Sophia?

00:04:16.956 --> 00:04:18.424 line:95%,end
I don't know.

00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:22.462 line:95%,end
And at the top of the pyramid is Sophia.

00:04:22.528 --> 00:04:25.865 line:95%,end
I think the ceiling was going
to cave in at the Abby Lee Dance Company

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:28.601 line:95%,end
because Maddie
was not on the top of the pyramid.

00:04:29.402 --> 00:04:30.703 line:95%,end
It was Sophie.

00:04:31.738 --> 00:04:32.739 line:95%,end
Kind of a given.

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:36.442 line:95%,end
She won the high score overall,
nine to 11-year-old,

00:04:37.143 --> 00:04:40.046 line:95%,end
and she won the entire competition.

00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:41.614 line:95%,end
She was the high score of the day.

00:04:41.681 --> 00:04:43.583 line:95%,end
Sophia is still a part of this team

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.251 line:95%,end
and she will remain on the pyramid.

00:04:45.318 --> 00:04:47.754 line:95%,end
Just because she's in LA shooting a movie,

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.589 line:95%,end
that's just another feather in my cap.

00:04:49.656 --> 00:04:54.327 line:95%,end
This weekend, we will be traveling
to Greensboro, North Carolina.


00:04:54.694 --> 00:04:58.431 line:95%,end
We will be attending
Dance Troupe Challenge.

00:04:59.465 --> 00:05:00.566 line:95%,end
Since Brooke's not on the pyramid,

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:03.002 line:95%,end
does that mean
she's not going this weekend?

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:07.540 line:5%,start
Well, Brooke, I want to know,
what happened over the weekend?

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:09.976 line:5%,start
Right.

00:05:18.184 --> 00:05:19.986 line:5%,start
So you didn't come to rehearsal Sunday?

00:05:21.854 --> 00:05:22.989 line:95%,end
You're 14.

00:05:23.056 --> 00:05:24.390 line:95%,end
You've been taking ballet class

00:05:24.857 --> 00:05:26.292 line:95%,end
since you were six or seven years old.

00:05:26.359 --> 00:05:28.127 line:95%,end
Abby, if she's going to do that,

00:05:28.194 --> 00:05:30.063 line:95%,end
like she spent the entire week

00:05:30.496 --> 00:05:32.165 line:95%,end
learning the number with this group.

00:05:32.231 --> 00:05:34.567 line:95%,end
Why wouldn't she just go away with us
and keep the number?

00:05:34.634 --> 00:05:39.005 line:95%,end
But that doesn't mean you don't do
anything dance-wise all weekend.

00:05:40.206 --> 00:05:42.608 line:95%,end
KELLY: I realized
that Brooke didn't dance last week

00:05:42.675 --> 00:05:45.978 line:95%,end
so she's not on the pyramid,
but she is still part of the group.

00:05:46.045 --> 00:05:49.349 line:95%,end
Sophia is not even here
and she's at the top of the pyramid,

00:05:49.415 --> 00:05:51.317 line:95%,end
and Brooke is and she's not on it at all.

00:05:51.384 --> 00:05:54.287 line:95%,end
The group piece is entitled "Voyage Home."

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:56.556 line:95%,end
this is a very serious piece.

00:05:56.756 --> 00:05:58.558 line:95%,end
You will be immigrants.

00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:02.261 line:95%,end
Everybody will be in the routine,

00:06:02.495 --> 00:06:05.631 line:95%,end
but Brooke, who will be staying home,
and Mackenzie.

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:10.937 line:95%,end
Brooke, I want to see you work
to get back into this group.

00:06:13.172 --> 00:06:16.008 line:95%,end
Mackenzie, you will be doing a solo.

00:06:16.075 --> 00:06:19.712 line:95%,end
My next solo will be Paige.

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:22.715 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:06:22.915 --> 00:06:28.121 line:95%,end
My next routine will be a duet
with Maddie and Kendall.

00:06:28.521 --> 00:06:30.990 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:06:32.492 --> 00:06:34.026 line:95%,end
Moms, you can head upstairs.

00:06:34.093 --> 00:06:35.695 line:95%,end
Ladies, spread apart.

00:06:35.762 --> 00:06:36.763 line:95%,end
Start warming up.

00:06:40.433 --> 00:06:43.136 line:95%,end
You wanna sit in your old spot?
Here you go.

00:06:43.202 --> 00:06:44.470 line:95%,end
Thank you.

00:06:44.537 --> 00:06:46.839 line:95%,end
Brooke, go over there
and play the music for us please

00:06:46.906 --> 00:06:50.209 line:95%,end
'cause I don't want
Gianna counting even messing...

00:06:50.276 --> 00:06:51.577 line:95%,end
Let's use Mackenzie.

00:06:52.111 --> 00:06:55.381 line:95%,end
I am planning on Sophia
showing up at the competition

00:06:55.448 --> 00:06:57.250 line:95%,end
and participating in the group number.

00:06:57.316 --> 00:06:59.652 line:95%,end
I have special parts built for her.

00:06:59.719 --> 00:07:01.487 line:95%,end
She's gonna work out just fine.

00:07:01.554 --> 00:07:03.990 line:95%,end
Start backing up. Everybody, backing up.

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:08.394 line:95%,end
I have Mackenzie being "the swing"
and blocking the spaces for Sophia.

00:07:08.461 --> 00:07:09.562 line:95%,end
It should be up there, Brooke.

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:10.730 line:95%,end
- Wait, wait.
- You said that already.

00:07:10.797 --> 00:07:12.365 line:95%,end
Did she put Mackenzie in now?

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:14.200 line:95%,end
Yeah, Brooke's now running the music.

00:07:14.901 --> 00:07:15.935 line:5%,start
Put your right foot back.

00:07:16.002 --> 00:07:17.069 line:5%,start
Dig your right foot.

00:07:17.403 --> 00:07:20.840 line:5%,start
This week's theme
is very lightly about immigrating.

00:07:20.907 --> 00:07:23.009 line:95%,end
It's more about getting
across that border.

00:07:23.075 --> 00:07:24.444 line:95%,end
It's about the struggle.

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:28.147 line:95%,end
And now we're stepping out and across.

00:07:28.214 --> 00:07:30.583 line:95%,end
It's a really cool contemporary piece.

00:07:30.683 --> 00:07:31.684 line:95%,end
The music's great,

00:07:31.818 --> 00:07:34.587 line:95%,end
and I want the kids
to push themselves artistically.

00:07:34.654 --> 00:07:36.122 line:95%,end
Some of their feet are flexed.

00:07:36.189 --> 00:07:37.356 line:95%,end
They're pulling on each other.

00:07:37.423 --> 00:07:38.925 line:95%,end
There's some partner work,

00:07:38.991 --> 00:07:41.194 line:95%,end
and that's something new for these kids.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:42.462 line:95%,end
And run!

00:07:45.665 --> 00:07:48.100 line:95%,end
So Brooke's really gonna further
her dance education

00:07:48.167 --> 00:07:49.435 line:95%,end
by running music and watching.

00:07:49.502 --> 00:07:52.772 line:95%,end
This is Sophia. This is not anybody else.

00:07:52.839 --> 00:07:55.441 line:95%,end
She's playing like Sophie,
you know what I mean?

00:07:55.508 --> 00:07:58.277 line:5%,start
BROOKE: Although I'm happy
I'm not competing this weekend,

00:07:58.344 --> 00:08:00.713 line:5%,start
there is a part of me
that really wishes I was there,

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.416 line:5%,start
because I wanted to show the
girls that although I'm not

00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:05.551 line:5%,start
on the team, I still do really care

00:08:05.618 --> 00:08:07.286 line:95%,end
and I just wanted to support them.

00:08:07.353 --> 00:08:09.755 line:95%,end
My daughter was here all last week

00:08:10.289 --> 00:08:11.958 line:95%,end
and she's here today for pyramid.

00:08:12.024 --> 00:08:13.893 line:95%,end
Two weeks in a row
she's been here for pyramid

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.628 line:95%,end
and has not been on that pyramid.

00:08:15.695 --> 00:08:18.965 line:95%,end
Sophia is on top of the pyramid
and she's not even here.

00:08:19.031 --> 00:08:20.466 line:95%,end
Brooke is part of the team.

00:08:20.533 --> 00:08:23.135 line:95%,end
She needs to be
at the dance competition with me.

00:08:23.202 --> 00:08:24.637 line:95%,end
It's [bleep].

00:08:24.704 --> 00:08:28.140 line:95%,end
Remember, you're an immigrant
coming through the desert

00:08:28.207 --> 00:08:32.445 line:95%,end
or coming on a boat
that you've been on for days

00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:33.779 line:95%,end
and days and days.

00:08:34.547 --> 00:08:38.918 line:95%,end
KELLY: Wait. Did Abby just say
that they're immigrating?

00:08:38.985 --> 00:08:43.656 line:95%,end
It has to do with them being immigrants
in the Ivy League Dance Company.

00:08:43.823 --> 00:08:46.492 line:95%,end
Except we've been on this team
since they were born.

00:08:46.559 --> 00:08:48.327 line:95%,end
Yup, that's what it is.

00:08:48.394 --> 00:08:51.597 line:95%,end
She got lucky 'cause these
little immigrants are good dancers.

00:08:52.231 --> 00:08:54.600 line:95%,end
Watch that back foot.
Keep it pressed into the ground.

00:08:54.667 --> 00:08:56.135 line:95%,end
Flex your feet there, Kendall.

00:08:56.602 --> 00:08:57.904 line:95%,end
- ...seven, eight...
- Turn your left.

00:08:57.970 --> 00:08:59.839 line:95%,end
I didn't think about
when Dee did Maddie's hair.

00:08:59.906 --> 00:09:02.008 line:95%,end
I'm like, oh, man,
it does look like Sophie's.

00:09:02.608 --> 00:09:05.344 line:95%,end
Do you think Maddie's sad
she doesn't have a solo?

00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:06.846 line:95%,end
Um, she's happy she has a duet.

00:09:06.913 --> 00:09:08.481 line:95%,end
- Is she happy?
- So yeah.

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:11.417 line:95%,end
- Is she OK with that?
- Oh, yeah, just tickled pink.

00:09:13.119 --> 00:09:18.057 line:95%,end
You have to know that Maddie
feels a little disappointed in Abby and--

00:09:18.124 --> 00:09:20.192 line:95%,end
- Sure.
- --the Sophia thing.

00:09:20.259 --> 00:09:21.694 line:95%,end
Oh, a little.

00:09:21.761 --> 00:09:23.563 line:95%,end
Are you kidding me?
It's not a little, honey.

00:09:23.629 --> 00:09:25.698 line:95%,end
- What does she say?
- She goes, Mom, I like Sophia.

00:09:25.765 --> 00:09:28.134 line:95%,end
- I said, honey, I know you do.
- It's got nothing to do with that.

00:09:28.434 --> 00:09:29.802 line:5%,start
Maddie is amazing on her own.

00:09:29.869 --> 00:09:31.871 line:5%,start
She doesn't need that from Abby.

00:09:31.938 --> 00:09:33.005 line:95%,end
It's just not fair.

00:09:33.072 --> 00:09:34.073 line:95%,end
But guess what?

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:35.942 line:95%,end
Kendall could be amazing on her own, too.


00:09:41.881 --> 00:09:44.016 line:5%,start
[music playing]

00:09:44.116 --> 00:09:45.851 line:5%,start
Such a great day to go visit Abby.

00:09:45.918 --> 00:09:48.020 line:95%,end
It's never a good day to visit Abby.

00:09:48.087 --> 00:09:50.122 line:5%,start
Abby asked us all
to come over to her house

00:09:50.189 --> 00:09:53.159 line:5%,start
and go through her garage
and look for old dance stuff.

00:09:53.225 --> 00:09:55.761 line:95%,end
I don't know
why we can't say no to this lady.

00:09:55.828 --> 00:09:57.663 line:95%,end
- ABBY LEE MILLER: Hello?
- Hello.

00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:58.831 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: Come on in.

00:09:58.898 --> 00:10:00.232 line:95%,end
Oh, my gosh.

00:10:00.299 --> 00:10:02.602 line:95%,end
- ABBY LEE MILLER: Here we go.
- Wow.

00:10:02.668 --> 00:10:05.271 line:95%,end
Here's the main things
that I'm looking for.

00:10:05.338 --> 00:10:09.275 line:95%,end
I'm looking for old programs,
but there's also some props

00:10:09.342 --> 00:10:11.277 line:95%,end
that I think that we could do
for dance routines

00:10:11.344 --> 00:10:13.613 line:95%,end
that we don't have
to pay for new props to be made.

00:10:13.913 --> 00:10:16.148 line:95%,end
All right, get started.
Let's go. Let's go.

00:10:16.215 --> 00:10:17.483 line:95%,end
I'm not touching anything in here.

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:19.218 line:5%,start
God knows what's growing in that garage,

00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:21.854 line:5%,start
and I do not feel
like getting a case of scabies.

00:10:21.921 --> 00:10:23.756 line:5%,start
[gasps] There's mice droppings in here.

00:10:23.823 --> 00:10:27.593 line:95%,end
[screams] Oh, my gosh, I hit a jackpot.

00:10:28.494 --> 00:10:29.528 line:95%,end
Look at Abby here.

00:10:29.595 --> 00:10:30.963 line:95%,end
Too pure to be pink, Abby.

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:32.798 line:95%,end
[laughs]

00:10:33.065 --> 00:10:36.435 line:95%,end
Melissa is like gung-ho
on cleaning out this garage.

00:10:36.502 --> 00:10:39.905 line:95%,end
She's thinking, I'm going to kick butt
cleaning this garage

00:10:39.972 --> 00:10:42.475 line:95%,end
because Maddie is going
to get her at the top of the pyramid.

00:10:42.541 --> 00:10:44.276 line:95%,end
This is right up Melissa's alley.

00:10:44.343 --> 00:10:46.445 line:95%,end
I don't-- I don't know what's worse,
her cleaning out the junk

00:10:46.512 --> 00:10:47.880 line:95%,end
or kissing Abby's ass.

00:10:47.947 --> 00:10:50.516 line:95%,end
She hit the jackpot.
This had your name on it.

00:10:50.583 --> 00:10:55.388 line:95%,end
"Kelly on probation
for cursing in the studio, 1979."

00:10:55.454 --> 00:10:57.556 line:95%,end
Some things never change, huh?

00:10:57.623 --> 00:11:00.259 line:95%,end
[screams]

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:01.527 line:95%,end
What is it?

00:11:01.594 --> 00:11:02.995 line:95%,end
Let's get out of here.

00:11:03.062 --> 00:11:04.664 line:95%,end
I think I touched it, God.

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:06.699 line:95%,end
[screams]

00:11:09.168 --> 00:11:10.403 line:5%,start
I don't do mice.

00:11:10.469 --> 00:11:12.138 line:95%,end
It was a lovely afternoon. I'm done.

00:11:12.204 --> 00:11:13.572 line:95%,end
See you later.

00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:14.840 line:95%,end
Bye, Holly.

00:11:14.907 --> 00:11:16.676 line:95%,end
Oh, she's running.

00:11:17.209 --> 00:11:21.080 line:95%,end
I-I got two photos, ladies,
I'm sneaking out of the building.

00:11:22.048 --> 00:11:25.484 line:95%,end
I got the one of Abby
with a black eye and the same hairdo.

00:11:25.551 --> 00:11:28.354 line:95%,end
I'm going to dream about this tonight
and think that I did it to her.

00:11:28.421 --> 00:11:29.822 line:95%,end
[laughs]

00:11:29.889 --> 00:11:32.391 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:11:33.859 --> 00:11:34.794 line:95%,end
Fabulous.

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.530 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: Now, the name of your routine
is "Lemonade."

00:11:37.596 --> 00:11:39.198 line:5%,start
But I don't want a lemon
out on that stage.

00:11:39.265 --> 00:11:40.399 line:5%,start
You know what a lemon is?

00:11:40.466 --> 00:11:44.870 line:5%,start
A lemon is you buy a car
and everything goes wrong with the car.

00:11:45.237 --> 00:11:47.339 line:5%,start
My solos this week is called "Lemonade,"

00:11:47.406 --> 00:11:53.145 line:5%,start
and I am going to be
a big glass of L-E-M-O-N-A-D-E.

00:11:53.212 --> 00:11:56.449 line:95%,end
Like when something's sour,
it's like-- go.

00:11:56.515 --> 00:11:58.150 line:95%,end
Mackenzie does cute well,

00:11:58.217 --> 00:12:02.321 line:95%,end
but she has a few more difficult tricks
in her routine this week.

00:12:02.688 --> 00:12:06.358 line:95%,end
She's doing her round off back tuck
on stage on the bare floor.

00:12:06.425 --> 00:12:08.394 line:95%,end
She's doing her aerial walkover.

00:12:08.461 --> 00:12:10.296 line:95%,end
She's doing side aerials.

00:12:10.362 --> 00:12:14.734 line:95%,end
So I feel like pushing her in the level
of difficulty of her routine.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:19.438 line:95%,end
It needs to be more than a split.

00:12:19.772 --> 00:12:20.906 line:95%,end
That does look funny.

00:12:20.973 --> 00:12:22.174 line:95%,end
I love it.

00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:24.410 line:95%,end
She was like sitting
on her boobs, her bosom.

00:12:26.078 --> 00:12:27.913 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER:
All right, Paige, you're gonna dance now.

00:12:28.414 --> 00:12:30.850 line:95%,end
KELLY: God, Paige is gonna get tortured.

00:12:30.916 --> 00:12:32.985 line:95%,end
No, she's in a good mood.
You were her servant today.

00:12:33.052 --> 00:12:34.887 line:95%,end
No. Yeah, you helped her out.

00:12:34.954 --> 00:12:37.857 line:95%,end
- You only stole two things.
- [laughter]

00:12:37.923 --> 00:12:39.058 line:95%,end
Shut up, Jill.

00:12:39.125 --> 00:12:41.360 line:95%,end
I think you're-- you're ahead of the game.

00:12:42.228 --> 00:12:44.930 line:5%,start
All right, now Paige, you're 12.

00:12:44.997 --> 00:12:47.266 line:95%,end
You're gonna be dancing 12, 13.

00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:48.834 line:95%,end
So you need to dance up.

00:12:48.901 --> 00:12:50.336 line:95%,end
You need to dance older.

00:12:50.402 --> 00:12:51.737 line:95%,end
And make things big.

00:12:51.804 --> 00:12:53.105 line:95%,end
Give it 100%.

00:12:53.172 --> 00:12:55.174 line:5%,start
This is my first solo of the season

00:12:55.241 --> 00:12:57.042 line:5%,start
so I need to be better than good

00:12:57.109 --> 00:12:59.912 line:95%,end
and I need to prove to Miss Abby
that I deserve to be here.

00:13:00.446 --> 00:13:01.447 line:95%,end
Stop.

00:13:02.381 --> 00:13:06.952 line:95%,end
[stutters] The arms are not a dishrag,
a dishwash cloth.

00:13:07.019 --> 00:13:08.521 line:95%,end
She's yelling at her about her arms

00:13:08.587 --> 00:13:10.289 line:95%,end
because Paige has noodly arms.

00:13:10.356 --> 00:13:11.590 line:95%,end
- And I...
- They're so long, that's why.

00:13:11.657 --> 00:13:13.592 line:95%,end
KELLY: I totally agree with Abby.

00:13:13.659 --> 00:13:16.595 line:95%,end
And I don't mind Abby
for yelling at her for her arms,

00:13:16.662 --> 00:13:19.965 line:95%,end
because when she yells her
for being stupid, that bothers me.

00:13:20.032 --> 00:13:21.367 line:95%,end
Don't look at your mother.

00:13:21.433 --> 00:13:24.170 line:95%,end
Every time you look at your mother,
you get 20 push-ups.

00:13:24.236 --> 00:13:26.272 line:95%,end
KELLY:
I think Paige is ready for this solo

00:13:26.338 --> 00:13:29.375 line:95%,end
and Abby just doesn't
ever give her a chance.

00:13:29.441 --> 00:13:31.944 line:95%,end
And I think
if she would give Paige the chance

00:13:32.144 --> 00:13:34.914 line:95%,end
and get her up on stage,
she would get used to it.

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:35.981 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: All right, breathe.


00:13:36.048 --> 00:13:37.049 line:95%,end
Go get a drink.

00:13:37.116 --> 00:13:38.350 line:95%,end
We're goin' on to the group.

00:13:39.018 --> 00:13:41.053 line:95%,end
I'm gonna go downstairs
for a little bit, OK?

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.121 line:95%,end
What are you doing?

00:13:47.893 --> 00:13:49.929 line:95%,end
Get back to the top of that pyramid

00:13:49.995 --> 00:13:52.097 line:95%,end
in any way, shape or form you can.

00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:54.533 line:95%,end
Does anybody else feel like this?

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.569 line:95%,end
I'm fine. I don't care.

00:13:57.636 --> 00:13:59.572 line:95%,end
It's a f... It's an act.

00:14:00.039 --> 00:14:01.974 line:95%,end
Melissa and Maddie are so overwhelmed

00:14:02.041 --> 00:14:04.109 line:95%,end
by the fact that Sophia
is here on the team

00:14:04.176 --> 00:14:05.744 line:95%,end
and they're kind of living in her shadow.

00:14:05.811 --> 00:14:07.713 line:95%,end
I don't think either one of them know
what to do with themselves

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:10.115 line:95%,end
now that they're in somebody
else's shadow.

00:14:10.583 --> 00:14:12.384 line:95%,end
Paige, back foot!

00:14:14.086 --> 00:14:15.754 line:95%,end
Three times I told you.

00:14:16.589 --> 00:14:17.823 line:95%,end
More acting.

00:14:18.691 --> 00:14:20.826 line:95%,end
I don't think you understand that you're--
like there's people

00:14:20.893 --> 00:14:23.963 line:95%,end
with machine guns in their cars
that won't let you get out of the car.

00:14:25.097 --> 00:14:26.966 line:95%,end
Like you need to be stronger.

00:14:27.266 --> 00:14:28.701 line:95%,end
I'm not... I'm seeing this.

00:14:31.203 --> 00:14:32.671 line:95%,end
Be tougher!

00:14:33.072 --> 00:14:34.173 line:95%,end
Come on.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.808 line:95%,end
Don't be so weak.

00:14:39.979 --> 00:14:41.380 line:95%,end
[music continuing]

00:14:41.447 --> 00:14:45.351 line:95%,end
On your left. Eight, four, five, six.

00:14:45.417 --> 00:14:48.821 line:95%,end
We're starting the duet.
It's called "Sugar and Spice."

00:14:49.088 --> 00:14:51.357 line:5%,start
Understood? I don't know
why you're all laughing and silly.

00:14:52.124 --> 00:14:54.693 line:95%,end
That much time ago you were doing a solo

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:56.462 line:95%,end
and at the top of the pyramid.

00:14:56.528 --> 00:14:58.264 line:95%,end
That's where you always were,

00:14:58.364 --> 00:15:00.633 line:95%,end
and now you're her duet partner?

00:15:02.067 --> 00:15:03.335 line:95%,end
I wouldn't be laughing about it.

00:15:03.402 --> 00:15:05.738 line:95%,end
Well, why is a duet
something that's downgraded?

00:15:05.804 --> 00:15:06.672 line:95%,end
I don't know.

00:15:06.739 --> 00:15:10.042 line:95%,end
Because Sophia is the star now
so she's getting the solos.

00:15:10.109 --> 00:15:13.545 line:95%,end
But a duet or a trio
is still a lovely thing to do.

00:15:13.612 --> 00:15:15.214 line:95%,end
That's what I said. It's...
I think it is, too.

00:15:15.281 --> 00:15:17.383 line:95%,end
That's not a downgraded opportunity.

00:15:17.449 --> 00:15:19.051 line:95%,end
So you don't feel like that's a downgrade?

00:15:19.118 --> 00:15:20.386 line:95%,end
- No.
- Absolutely not.

00:15:20.452 --> 00:15:23.522 line:95%,end
I think a duet is a great dance.

00:15:23.589 --> 00:15:27.326 line:95%,end
Any time Mia gets a chance to dance,
I am happy.

00:15:27.393 --> 00:15:30.029 line:95%,end
So I don't know what Melissa thinks.
I think it's great.

00:15:30.095 --> 00:15:32.765 line:95%,end
- [music playing]
- (SINGING) Everybody--

00:15:32.831 --> 00:15:35.067 line:95%,end
MADDIE:
"Sugar and Spice" is a very fun dance.

00:15:35.134 --> 00:15:38.304 line:95%,end
It's upbeat and cute, but it's not hard.

00:15:38.604 --> 00:15:40.272 line:5%,start
I wish I had a solo this week

00:15:40.339 --> 00:15:43.542 line:5%,start
because solos
are so much more challenging for me.

00:15:43.842 --> 00:15:46.545 line:95%,end
Now look at each other
like, what are you wearing?

00:15:46.612 --> 00:15:47.947 line:95%,end
Uh-huh.

00:15:48.013 --> 00:15:49.915 line:95%,end
KENDALL:
I really want to do well in a duet

00:15:49.982 --> 00:15:52.685 line:5%,start
because since there's only two people,

00:15:52.751 --> 00:15:55.387 line:5%,start
you can sort of tell if one messes up.

00:15:55.988 --> 00:15:58.924 line:95%,end
All right, girls,
you're done for right now.

00:15:58.991 --> 00:16:00.025 line:95%,end
You have tomorrow,

00:16:00.092 --> 00:16:02.661 line:95%,end
and Saturday morning
we leave for Greensboro. Got it?

00:16:06.665 --> 00:16:08.701 line:95%,end
Oh, somebody was in here
looking for stuff.

00:16:08.767 --> 00:16:10.569 line:95%,end
Yeah, because this is just all-- look.

00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:12.604 line:95%,end
We all know that Melissa wants Maddie back

00:16:12.671 --> 00:16:15.841 line:95%,end
on top of the pyramid,
and she wants her daughter doing a solo.

00:16:15.908 --> 00:16:18.978 line:95%,end
Hey, uh, what did you think
about the duet?

00:16:20.446 --> 00:16:21.880 line:95%,end
Not happy about that, but...

00:16:21.947 --> 00:16:23.716 line:95%,end
Maddie was the one doing a solo every week

00:16:23.782 --> 00:16:25.284 line:95%,end
and now she's doing a duet with Kendall.

00:16:25.351 --> 00:16:30.122 line:95%,end
Yeah.
I think, you know, it's just different.

00:16:30.189 --> 00:16:33.592 line:95%,end
Did Melissa just admit to me
that she's not happy

00:16:33.659 --> 00:16:35.160 line:95%,end
Maddie has a duet with Kendall?

00:16:36.195 --> 00:16:37.196 line:95%,end
Interesting.

00:16:39.264 --> 00:16:42.668 line:95%,end
If Abby thinks this is a downgrade
for Maddie, she's wrong,

00:16:42.735 --> 00:16:45.971 line:95%,end
because Kendall can keep up
and this duet looks adorable.

00:16:46.038 --> 00:16:47.339 line:95%,end
I just don't understand

00:16:47.406 --> 00:16:51.310 line:95%,end
why she has to consistently
always drag Kendall down.

00:16:51.377 --> 00:16:54.046 line:95%,end
What concerns me the most
is that you came in

00:16:54.113 --> 00:16:55.647 line:95%,end
and told Maddie that she's been downgraded

00:16:55.714 --> 00:16:57.249 line:95%,end
to a duet with Kendall.

00:16:57.649 --> 00:16:59.284 line:95%,end
How do you think that makes Kendall feel?

00:16:59.351 --> 00:17:01.153 line:95%,end
Kendall is dancing with Maddie,

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:02.321 line:95%,end
and that's what she wants.

00:17:02.388 --> 00:17:03.889 line:95%,end
She's been dancing with Maddie
for a year now.

00:17:03.956 --> 00:17:05.924 line:95%,end
- Not in a duet, but--
- Never in a duet.

00:17:05.991 --> 00:17:07.993 line:95%,end
Never even in one trio.

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:10.029 line:95%,end
I don't think that was fair to say.

00:17:10.095 --> 00:17:12.698 line:95%,end
Hey, Melissa was the one
that stood in the store

00:17:12.898 --> 00:17:15.934 line:95%,end
and told me she wasn't thrilled
about her kid doing a duet with Kendall.

00:17:16.535 --> 00:17:18.504 line:95%,end
I-I don't know where
you want me to go with that.

00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:23.008 line:95%,end
That's just rude. Why do people think
their kids are so above others?

00:17:23.075 --> 00:17:25.477 line:95%,end
Melissa, you're busted. You lied to me.


00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:33.018 line:95%,end
Have you heard from Sophia?

00:17:33.085 --> 00:17:35.020 line:95%,end
- I have not heard from Sophia.
- Oh.

00:17:35.087 --> 00:17:38.290 line:95%,end
I'm a little worried
about her being on that movie.

00:17:38.357 --> 00:17:39.358 line:95%,end
How were the dances?

00:17:39.425 --> 00:17:40.859 line:95%,end
I finished the duet this morning.

00:17:40.926 --> 00:17:41.927 line:95%,end
- OK.
- It was hard.

00:17:41.994 --> 00:17:43.395 line:95%,end
- It was hard?
- Yeah.

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:47.666 line:95%,end
- You're ready.
- Hello. That looks good.

00:17:47.733 --> 00:17:49.234 line:95%,end
Hi, guys.

00:17:49.701 --> 00:17:51.336 line:95%,end
Chloe was telling me last night,

00:17:51.403 --> 00:17:54.106 line:95%,end
basically, like, you know,
how Sophia has the whole solo part.

00:17:54.173 --> 00:17:56.041 line:95%,end
But then she was saying
there's a whole section

00:17:56.108 --> 00:17:57.609 line:95%,end
that's only Maddie,
and she said Abby was saying,

00:17:57.676 --> 00:18:00.446 line:95%,end
like, you know, Sophia gets left behind
but Maddie crosses the border.

00:18:00.512 --> 00:18:03.082 line:95%,end
And she's like,
"Mom, not the four-- other four of us."

00:18:03.148 --> 00:18:04.550 line:95%,end
She's like, "She never even mentioned us."

00:18:04.616 --> 00:18:06.652 line:95%,end
Well, how about this?
I was talking to Abby,

00:18:06.718 --> 00:18:08.720 line:95%,end
and I wanted to say thank you
for the duet.

00:18:08.787 --> 00:18:10.923 line:95%,end
And she said,
"You know, Melissa came flat out

00:18:10.989 --> 00:18:12.558 line:95%,end
- and said she didn't want to do it."
- Oh, my God.

00:18:12.624 --> 00:18:14.560 line:95%,end
- Melissa said that to Abby?
- Mm-hmm.

00:18:15.094 --> 00:18:17.896 line:95%,end
I guess because she thinks Maddie's
too good to dance with Kendall. Mm-hmm.

00:18:18.464 --> 00:18:22.768 line:5%,start
Abby told Jill that Melissa was not happy
doing a duet with Kendall,

00:18:22.835 --> 00:18:25.537 line:5%,start
but it was a step down from doing a solo.

00:18:25.604 --> 00:18:28.540 line:5%,start
And I think that really hurt
Jill and Kendall's feelings.

00:18:28.607 --> 00:18:31.110 line:95%,end
Melissa told us that story upstairs
and Melissa said,

00:18:31.176 --> 00:18:33.745 line:95%,end
"Oh, I talked to Abby and
Abby said, how do you feel about the duet?

00:18:33.812 --> 00:18:36.215 line:95%,end
And she said,
'Oh, I'm really happy about it."'

00:18:36.281 --> 00:18:37.416 line:95%,end
Oh, she did.

00:18:37.483 --> 00:18:39.518 line:95%,end
- Did she say that?
- Yes.

00:18:39.918 --> 00:18:41.720 line:95%,end
Someone here is lying.

00:18:41.787 --> 00:18:44.957 line:95%,end
Abby, as everybody knows,
just speaks the truth.

00:18:45.023 --> 00:18:47.226 line:95%,end
She doesn't care if she's going
to hurt your feelings or not.

00:18:47.593 --> 00:18:49.695 line:95%,end
Melissa has lied to me many times before.

00:18:49.761 --> 00:18:50.963 line:95%,end
Don't you think that's wrong?

00:18:51.029 --> 00:18:52.164 line:95%,end
Yes.

00:18:52.231 --> 00:18:54.600 line:95%,end
You're allowed to not be happy about it.
Don't lie about it.

00:18:54.666 --> 00:18:55.701 line:95%,end
What do I do? I mean--

00:18:55.767 --> 00:18:57.269 line:95%,end
I would definitely say something.

00:18:57.336 --> 00:18:59.538 line:5%,start
I don't want to cause
any drama with this duet,

00:18:59.605 --> 00:19:02.040 line:5%,start
but I can't let Melissa
get away with this.

00:19:02.107 --> 00:19:05.611 line:95%,end
I can't let her think that her kid
is too good to dance with mine.

00:19:05.677 --> 00:19:06.745 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: All right, so ready?

00:19:06.812 --> 00:19:08.080 line:95%,end
Take it from your whole hip section.

00:19:08.147 --> 00:19:09.882 line:5%,start
Five, six, seven, eight, and...

[music playing]

00:19:11.183 --> 00:19:13.719 line:5%,start
(SINGING) Everybody, count off the rhythm.

00:19:13.785 --> 00:19:14.786 line:95%,end
Show us the way to dance.

00:19:14.853 --> 00:19:15.921 line:95%,end
- Hey.
- Hi.

00:19:15.988 --> 00:19:17.589 line:95%,end
Hi, ladies. How are you?

00:19:17.656 --> 00:19:19.892 line:95%,end
- We're doing a project.
- ABBY LEE: And down.

00:19:19.958 --> 00:19:21.894 line:95%,end
Now, what did you do
after the back handspring?

00:19:22.661 --> 00:19:23.829 line:95%,end
Can we kupe out of that?

00:19:23.896 --> 00:19:25.164 line:95%,end
Can we leap out of that?

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:26.732 line:95%,end
Can we jump out of that?

00:19:26.798 --> 00:19:29.535 line:95%,end
I have to tell you
that Abby told me last night

00:19:29.601 --> 00:19:31.970 line:95%,end
that you weren't happy
about doing a duet with Kendall.

00:19:33.038 --> 00:19:35.974 line:95%,end
- What?
- [stutters] And it hurts my feelings.

00:19:36.041 --> 00:19:37.209 line:95%,end
- I mean...
- Well, Jill--

00:19:37.276 --> 00:19:38.944 line:95%,end
I don't want to get all angry and scream.

00:19:39.011 --> 00:19:41.446 line:95%,end
- I never said that.
- Well, why would Abby tell me that?

00:19:42.014 --> 00:19:43.415 line:95%,end
She lies all the time.

00:19:43.482 --> 00:19:44.483 line:95%,end
Never said that.

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:46.919 line:95%,end
- Well, tell me how the conversation--
- I told you.

00:19:46.985 --> 00:19:47.986 line:95%,end
--went, that she would get that,

00:19:48.053 --> 00:19:50.455 line:95%,end
- that you weren't happy about it.
- Never said it, Jill.

00:19:50.522 --> 00:19:53.125 line:95%,end
I guess what hurts the most is, one,

00:19:53.192 --> 00:19:55.527 line:95%,end
that Abby truly believes that you think

00:19:55.594 --> 00:19:57.496 line:95%,end
Maddie's too good to dance with Kendall.

00:19:57.563 --> 00:19:58.830 line:95%,end
I never said that.

00:19:59.498 --> 00:20:01.266 line:95%,end
And that is hurtful.

00:20:01.333 --> 00:20:02.434 line:95%,end
Well, that's really funny.

00:20:02.501 --> 00:20:03.569 line:95%,end
And really disappointing,

00:20:03.635 --> 00:20:06.505 line:95%,end
because Christi sat here
and asked you how many times.

00:20:06.572 --> 00:20:08.674 line:95%,end
I'm excited. You told me how excited--

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:10.909 line:95%,end
- Well, I'm very excited.
- I told you. I told you.

00:20:10.976 --> 00:20:12.778 line:95%,end
And Kendall's very excited.

00:20:12.844 --> 00:20:15.514 line:95%,end
I think things like that
just hurt the kids' feelings.

00:20:15.581 --> 00:20:18.183 line:95%,end
Of course it does,
but I didn't hurt the kids' feelings

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:20.385 line:95%,end
because Abby asked me. I even told you.

00:20:20.452 --> 00:20:21.687 line:95%,end
I told you guys all yesterday.

00:20:22.154 --> 00:20:23.355 line:95%,end
She said, what do you think of the duet?

00:20:23.422 --> 00:20:27.859 line:95%,end
I said, I'm so excited.
And she goes, "It's a step down."

00:20:27.926 --> 00:20:28.994 line:95%,end
That's what she said to me.

00:20:29.061 --> 00:20:31.496 line:95%,end
Melissa just lied right to my face.

00:20:31.563 --> 00:20:34.099 line:95%,end
She told me she was happy
about the duet with Kendall

00:20:34.299 --> 00:20:36.401 line:95%,end
and Abby told me the exact opposite.

00:20:36.468 --> 00:20:38.704 line:95%,end
Melissa, you're busted. You lied to me.

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:40.872 line:95%,end
And let's face it,
they're all different levels.

00:20:40.939 --> 00:20:43.542 line:95%,end
They all have their strengths
and their weaknesses.

00:20:43.609 --> 00:20:45.177 line:95%,end
- I think they're...
- But it's not fair for a teacher to say

00:20:45.244 --> 00:20:47.646 line:95%,end
one kid's too good to dance with another

00:20:47.713 --> 00:20:49.514 line:95%,end
or for a mother to agree with it.

00:20:49.581 --> 00:20:51.783 line:95%,end
And that's...
I don't know how it went down,

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:53.785 line:95%,end
but that's what Abby been led me
to believe.

00:20:54.119 --> 00:20:56.255 line:95%,end
Well, you can believe
whatever you want to, Jill.

00:21:04.096 --> 00:21:06.898 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER:
Now, the girls, obviously, immigrants.

00:21:06.965 --> 00:21:08.100 line:95%,end
Watch, ladies.

00:21:08.166 --> 00:21:09.568 line:95%,end
The costumes for this week's competition

00:21:09.635 --> 00:21:11.436 line:95%,end
need to be dark and dramatic.

00:21:11.503 --> 00:21:13.538 line:95%,end
I want the girls to look

00:21:13.605 --> 00:21:17.276 line:95%,end
as though they've been through a whole lot
to get across that border.


00:21:17.342 --> 00:21:19.244 line:95%,end
Where are these children immigrating from?

00:21:19.311 --> 00:21:22.214 line:95%,end
We don't know.
They're trying to cross the border.

00:21:22.414 --> 00:21:25.951 line:95%,end
It's not about where they're coming from
but where they're going.

00:21:26.018 --> 00:21:27.586 line:95%,end
It's about the voyage home.

00:21:27.653 --> 00:21:30.756 line:95%,end
I'm listening
to Abby's definition of immigration

00:21:30.822 --> 00:21:32.090 line:95%,end
and I'm confused.

00:21:32.157 --> 00:21:34.393 line:95%,end
How on earth can you immigrate home?

00:21:34.459 --> 00:21:36.495 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:21:40.132 --> 00:21:41.800 line:5%,start
- Hi, Jim.
- Hi.

00:21:41.867 --> 00:21:42.968 line:95%,end
Good morning.

00:21:43.068 --> 00:21:45.470 line:95%,end
You wouldn't know what to do
if we didn't have pink suitcases.

00:21:45.537 --> 00:21:46.538 line:95%,end
That's right.

00:21:46.605 --> 00:21:48.807 line:95%,end
We're going back to Greensboro,
North Carolina this week,

00:21:48.874 --> 00:21:51.209 line:5%,start
and we actually attended DTI last year.

00:21:51.276 --> 00:21:52.778 line:5%,start
So we're familiar with the competition.

00:21:52.844 --> 00:21:54.980 line:95%,end
We know the judges. We did well last year.

00:21:55.047 --> 00:21:56.448 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: Come on, Jim, let's go.

00:22:00.218 --> 00:22:02.788 line:95%,end
Ladies, we're going
to the Dance Troupe Challenge

00:22:02.854 --> 00:22:05.223 line:95%,end
and we need to remember
that those kids are already there.

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:06.391 line:95%,end
They're already working.

00:22:06.458 --> 00:22:07.826 line:95%,end
So when you step into that hotel,

00:22:07.893 --> 00:22:09.127 line:95%,end
you don't know who's the judge.

00:22:09.194 --> 00:22:10.562 line:95%,end
You don't know who's a faculty member.

00:22:10.629 --> 00:22:12.764 line:95%,end
You don't know who's running it.
Game faces on.

00:22:12.831 --> 00:22:14.633 line:95%,end
No back talking your moms.

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:17.269 line:95%,end
Get in there
and pretend you're dancers, yes?

00:22:18.537 --> 00:22:20.639 line:95%,end
Oh... here we go.

00:22:20.706 --> 00:22:21.773 line:95%,end
"Good luck today.

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:23.075 line:95%,end
Thinking of you all.

00:22:23.141 --> 00:22:25.010 line:95%,end
Just got to set here in LA.

00:22:25.077 --> 00:22:26.945 line:95%,end
Last day of filming. Miss you all."

00:22:27.012 --> 00:22:28.347 line:95%,end
So what does that mean?

00:22:28.413 --> 00:22:29.781 line:95%,end
No Sophia this weekend?

00:22:29.848 --> 00:22:31.516 line:95%,end
No Sophia this weekend.

00:22:31.583 --> 00:22:35.087 line:95%,end
See, you should have just put Brooke
on the team from day one.

00:22:35.153 --> 00:22:36.988 line:95%,end
Well, day one you weren't there.

00:22:37.055 --> 00:22:39.391 line:95%,end
- You didn't show up on day one.
- Day one of this week.

00:22:40.025 --> 00:22:42.094 line:95%,end
Well, this week is a little late, Kelly.

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:43.695 line:95%,end
Yeah, well, Sophia wasn't there

00:22:43.762 --> 00:22:45.697 line:95%,end
- day one of this week either, was she?
- No.

00:22:45.764 --> 00:22:47.699 line:95%,end
- Brooke was there. She wasn't.
- No.

00:22:47.766 --> 00:22:48.767 line:95%,end
Nope.

00:22:48.834 --> 00:22:50.602 line:95%,end
She was doing a movie in Hollywood.

00:22:51.803 --> 00:22:54.573 line:95%,end
Brooke was at school with her friends.
Big difference.

00:22:54.673 --> 00:22:56.842 line:95%,end
Kelly, you have to understand,
I want stars.

00:22:56.908 --> 00:22:58.143 line:95%,end
I don't want mediocre.

00:22:58.777 --> 00:23:00.178 line:95%,end
KELLY: We know you want stars, Abby,

00:23:00.278 --> 00:23:03.648 line:95%,end
and it's clear that you'll do
whatever it takes to get those stars.

00:23:03.715 --> 00:23:05.450 line:95%,end
If you really wanna call it out,

00:23:05.751 --> 00:23:08.787 line:95%,end
then maybe you should say something
in front of Abby.

00:23:09.054 --> 00:23:10.222 line:95%,end
Yeah, but think of it this way.

00:23:10.288 --> 00:23:12.858 line:95%,end
If Abby had to pick
whose side she's gonna take--

00:23:12.924 --> 00:23:14.359 line:95%,end
- I mean--
- Oh, I don't know about that.

00:23:14.426 --> 00:23:17.496 line:95%,end
--if honesty is not the best policy
and she's going to pick a side,

00:23:17.562 --> 00:23:18.830 line:95%,end
I mean, I'm gonna leave.

00:23:19.131 --> 00:23:23.602 line:95%,end
Abby is not going to want to be the one
who's accused of lying.

00:23:23.668 --> 00:23:27.038 line:95%,end
I think she'll choose her own side,
because if Melissa is calling her a liar,

00:23:27.105 --> 00:23:29.274 line:95%,end
Abby's not gonna stand
for being called a liar.

00:23:40.952 --> 00:23:43.321 line:95%,end
All those people lined up in that hallway,

00:23:43.522 --> 00:23:47.125 line:95%,end
all those people so excited to see you,
why do you think that is?

00:23:47.459 --> 00:23:49.561 line:95%,end
National champions.

00:23:49.628 --> 00:23:52.230 line:95%,end
So step up to the plate, get it in gear,

00:23:52.297 --> 00:23:55.667 line:95%,end

Paige, you're 12 now.

00:24:08.914 --> 00:24:11.149 line:95%,end
Were your arms straight behind you
like Chloe's,

00:24:11.216 --> 00:24:13.518 line:95%,end
and your sternum open
every time you rolled around?

00:24:13.919 --> 00:24:16.121 line:95%,end
Were your elbows lifted
and supported through your back

00:24:16.188 --> 00:24:18.890 line:95%,end
on your PK-- PK tinsica.

00:24:20.358 --> 00:24:25.197 line:95%,end
Those are all things
that we went over and over and over.

00:24:25.964 --> 00:24:28.066 line:5%,start
I feel like Paige wants to get out there

00:24:28.133 --> 00:24:30.402 line:5%,start
and show Abby that she can do this solo.

00:24:30.469 --> 00:24:33.705 line:5%,start
She is listening, and she will make
a few of those corrections.

00:24:35.507 --> 00:24:38.643 line:95%,end
Mackenzie, you made a mockery
of your entire routine

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:40.779 line:95%,end
with that bow falling out
and then doing your back handspring

00:24:40.846 --> 00:24:41.880 line:95%,end
the wrong direction.

00:24:46.218 --> 00:24:48.086 line:95%,end
Now you have an even bigger headpiece.

00:24:48.553 --> 00:24:49.855 line:95%,end
Don't let it happen again.

All right, are we ready?
Let's walk the mile.

about not having a solo is what I said.

you have a selective memory.

She's not perfect.

I won't.

You know what?

00:30:37.802 --> 00:30:39.771 line:5%,start
She... Tell her to stop.

You've worked really hard

00:30:40.972 --> 00:30:43.775 line:95%,end

Come on, Kendall. Come on.

00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:47.011 line:95%,end
I gave it to her.

00:30:47.078 --> 00:30:48.680 line:95%,end

00:30:48.746 --> 00:30:50.081 line:95%,end

00:30:50.215 --> 00:30:51.416 line:95%,end
- Why?
- I am not tearing her down.

00:30:51.516 --> 00:30:53.284 line:95%,end

- Yes, you are.

00:30:53.351 --> 00:30:54.352 line:95%,end
You're gonna ruin it.

00:30:54.586 --> 00:30:57.922 line:95%,end
Jill, your child's foot is sickled
and I'm correcting it.

00:30:59.757 --> 00:31:01.860 line:5%,start
Because I'm not gonna let that big...

00:31:02.694 --> 00:31:05.530 line:95%,end
you know what sit there
and belittle you. I'm not.

00:31:05.597 --> 00:31:08.867 line:5%,start
I can't stand to hear her
screaming at Kendall anymore.

00:31:08.933 --> 00:31:10.034 line:5%,start
I can't stand it.

00:31:10.335 --> 00:31:11.569 line:95%,end
This is the plan.

00:31:11.636 --> 00:31:15.006 line:95%,end
I hope everybody's happy
the plan fell into place.

00:31:15.073 --> 00:31:18.009 line:95%,end

Well, I'm sugar and spice

I thought we were together,

00:32:57.375 --> 00:33:00.278 line:95%,end
and Kendall took all the corrections
and applied them.

00:33:00.878 --> 00:33:03.481 line:95%,end
- Good job.
- You did good, guys.

00:33:03.548 --> 00:33:04.816 line:95%,end
Really good job.

It's OK, Abby, you can give corrections.

Oh, you're allowing me
to correct my students now?

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:20.431 line:95%,end
You can do whatever you want.

00:33:20.498 --> 00:33:22.633 line:95%,end
I just don't want you screaming,
hurting feelings

before they go out on stage.

00:33:24.502 --> 00:33:26.904 line:95%,end
Jill, if you looked
at your kid doing that bit

00:33:26.971 --> 00:33:29.140 line:95%,end
and thought that her leg
was in a la seconde,

00:33:29.207 --> 00:33:31.175 line:95%,end
go to the optometrist
or the ophthalmologist,

00:33:31.242 --> 00:33:32.243 line:95%,end
because it was not.

00:33:32.343 --> 00:33:36.014 line:95%,end
You needed to get up off your chair
and hands-on and show her.

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:37.348 line:95%,end
I did!

00:33:37.415 --> 00:33:38.816 line:95%,end
You sat right there. I--

00:33:38.883 --> 00:33:42.820 line:95%,end
Jill, in the studio,
you get your face out of your phone

00:33:42.887 --> 00:33:43.955 line:95%,end
and pay attention.

00:33:44.055 --> 00:33:47.692 line:95%,end
Because you have said to me
if Kendall just gets her chance,

00:33:47.759 --> 00:33:49.994 line:95%,end
if Kendall just gets an opportunity,

00:33:50.061 --> 00:33:51.963 line:95%,end
she will dance up to that level.

00:33:52.597 --> 00:33:54.832 line:95%,end
I gave it. I didn't see it.

00:33:56.334 --> 00:33:59.670 line:95%,end
And you picked on her
the entire week about it.

00:33:59.737 --> 00:34:00.805 line:95%,end
Pick on her?

00:34:00.872 --> 00:34:02.740 line:95%,end
- Yes.
- Kiss my butt.

00:34:04.609 --> 00:34:05.810 line:95%,end
No, thank you.

00:34:05.877 --> 00:34:07.078 line:95%,end
Get over yourself.

Every time I call her,
good or bad, I am fixing her.

00:34:11.449 --> 00:34:12.483 line:95%,end
Say thank you.

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:15.720 line:95%,end
Every time I say your kid's name,
it should be a thank you.

You should all be just fine
without Sophia.

Kendall, you remember your part,
how you move into the middle

00:36:24.515 --> 00:36:25.950 line:95%,end
where Sophia used to be?

00:36:26.584 --> 00:36:27.985 line:95%,end
You're not going to screw that up.

You know what you're doing.

I think the girls
will be fine doing the parts

00:36:31.889 --> 00:36:34.659 line:95%,end
because Sophia
never really does the dance.

00:36:34.725 --> 00:36:35.726 line:95%,end
No, I know. I just...

00:36:35.793 --> 00:36:38.296 line:95%,end
I mean, compare her devil pipe
point blank to Chloe's.

00:36:38.829 --> 00:36:41.599 line:95%,end
Yes, and her dance teacher from San Diego

00:36:41.666 --> 00:36:43.868 line:95%,end
taught it, where you taught Chloe.
So her--

00:36:43.935 --> 00:36:45.836 line:95%,end
No, I taught Chloe to do it correctly.

00:36:45.903 --> 00:36:46.971 line:95%,end
Chloe pikes it forward

00:36:47.038 --> 00:36:49.240 line:95%,end
and she gets told about it every time
she does it.

00:36:52.443 --> 00:36:55.046 line:95%,end
Right now, we're getting ready
to do the group.

00:36:55.112 --> 00:36:57.782 line:95%,end
And since me and Maddie won for the duet,

00:36:57.848 --> 00:37:00.384 line:95%,end

- [cheering]

00:39:48.119 --> 00:39:50.287 line:5%,start
Oh, yes!

00:39:50.354 --> 00:39:51.922 line:5%,start
You were amazing.

00:39:52.256 --> 00:39:54.125 line:5%,start
Pipe down over there.

00:39:54.191 --> 00:39:56.093 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: The "Voyage Home" was a success.

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:58.396 line:95%,end
Was it amazing, Christi? No.

00:39:58.462 --> 00:40:00.064 line:95%,end
It isn't your place to say that.

00:40:00.464 --> 00:40:01.665 line:95%,end
Certainly not.

00:40:02.266 --> 00:40:05.102 line:95%,end
But they won,
and it will go down in the history books

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:08.706 line:95%,end
as another victory
for the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:40:09.106 --> 00:40:10.608 line:95%,end
[cheering]

00:40:12.243 --> 00:40:14.178 line:95%,end
High five.

00:40:14.812 --> 00:40:16.947 line:95%,end
Congratulations, girls.

00:40:17.014 --> 00:40:18.716 line:95%,end
Amazing.

00:40:18.783 --> 00:40:19.884 line:95%,end
Christi, amazing.

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:22.453 line:95%,end
- They were amazing.
- They were amazing.

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:25.423 line:95%,end
Really? You really think that,
just 'cause they got lucky and won?

00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:27.258 line:95%,end
Kendall, are you gonna admit
that you screwed

00:40:27.324 --> 00:40:29.627 line:95%,end
the whole dance up
and that you were off timing?

00:40:29.693 --> 00:40:31.862 line:95%,end
I messed up one part, not the whole dance.

00:40:31.929 --> 00:40:35.032 line:95%,end
JILL: It couldn't have been that bad
because they won the whole thing, Abby.

00:40:35.099 --> 00:40:36.367 line:95%,end
Yeah, you know what?

00:40:36.434 --> 00:40:38.269 line:95%,end
Last week they looked at Sophia.

00:40:38.335 --> 00:40:40.738 line:95%,end
Today, you couldn't take
your eyes off of Maddie.

00:40:40.805 --> 00:40:41.939 line:5%,start
How hurtful is that?

00:40:42.006 --> 00:40:47.978 line:5%,start
How ignorant is that to say
to a child in front of everybody

00:40:48.479 --> 00:40:50.080 line:95%,end
when the number just won?

00:40:50.147 --> 00:40:51.582 line:95%,end
Some people are good soloists.

00:40:51.649 --> 00:40:53.083 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE:
Some people are better in a group.

00:40:54.151 --> 00:40:56.387 line:95%,end
Other people choke on stage.

00:40:56.454 --> 00:40:57.488 line:95%,end
There you have it.

00:40:58.956 --> 00:41:00.391 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER (VOICEOVER):
Next on "Dance Moms."

00:41:00.458 --> 00:41:02.326 line:5%,start
I wanna make sure that you're all aware,

00:41:02.393 --> 00:41:04.795 line:5%,start
your replacements
will be at the competition.

00:41:04.862 --> 00:41:06.630 line:5%,start
You're really like making fun of our kids?

00:41:06.697 --> 00:41:07.965 line:5%,start
Yeah.

00:41:08.032 --> 00:41:11.302 line:5%,start
I was just gonna ask you
if I could have a solo.

00:41:11.368 --> 00:41:12.703 line:5%,start
Uh-uh.

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:15.806 line:5%,start
Your mom did this and you let it happen.

00:41:15.873 --> 00:41:17.107 line:5%,start
Sorry.

00:41:17.508 --> 00:41:21.412 line:5%,start
If one person really has the dreams
to do this for a living,

00:41:21.479 --> 00:41:23.147 line:5%,start
nothing should get in their way.

00:41:23.214 --> 00:41:24.882 line:5%,start
Not your personal life.

00:41:24.949 --> 00:41:26.550 line:5%,start
You picked on the children!

00:41:26.617 --> 00:41:27.985 line:5%,start
'Cause you're an idiot!
