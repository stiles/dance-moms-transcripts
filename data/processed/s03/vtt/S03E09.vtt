ABBY LEE MILLER (VOICEOVER):
Previously on "Dance Moms."

00:00:02.802 --> 00:00:03.970 line:5%,start
Nice job, Chloe.

00:00:04.037 --> 00:00:05.438 line:5%,start
Replace us, that's fine.

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:08.108 line:5%,start
Chloe made a mistake.

00:00:08.174 --> 00:00:09.242 line:5%,start
She dropped her hat.

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.211 line:5%,start
Chloe is suspended. So is her mother.

00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:12.712 line:5%,start
Such terrible language.

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:14.147 line:5%,start
Don't talk to another woman like that.

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:15.615 line:5%,start
Thank you. Thank you.
I wouldn't [inaudible]

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:16.950 line:5%,start
I think she's immature

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:18.251 line:5%,start
and I think
she needs to grow up a little bit.

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:19.986 line:5%,start
If you didn't walk in her shoes
when she couldn't walk.

00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:21.788 line:5%,start
I'm this far from pulling the duet.

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:23.890 line:5%,start
You are a monstrosity of evil.

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:26.026 line:5%,start
You're done. You're done. No duet.

00:00:26.092 --> 00:00:28.361 line:5%,start
Shut your mouth. Shut your mouth.

00:00:28.428 --> 00:00:30.597 line:5%,start
Get out. Get lost, bitch.

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:32.599 line:5%,start
ABBY LEE MILLER (VOICEOVER):
Coming up on "Dance Moms."

00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:34.934 line:5%,start
They don't self-motivate themselves.

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:36.302 line:5%,start
They don't get out there and work on it.

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:37.804 line:5%,start
When do you want them to work on it?

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:39.372 line:5%,start
All I wanted was a phone call from you.

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:41.741 line:5%,start
I wanted to ask you if Paige and I can

00:00:41.808 --> 00:00:43.143 line:5%,start
do the duet this weekend?

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:45.311 line:5%,start
Let me think about it. I'm not saying no.

00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:47.247 line:5%,start
Lock the back knee in the lunge.

00:00:47.313 --> 00:00:49.149 line:5%,start
Oh, somebody's foot was flexed.

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:50.917 line:5%,start
Don't give her the power to upset you.

00:00:50.984 --> 00:00:52.952 line:5%,start
My daughter has a name.

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:54.120 line:5%,start
- So do you.
- Yeah.

00:00:54.187 --> 00:00:55.355 line:5%,start
Starts with a B.

00:00:55.422 --> 00:00:58.058 line:5%,start
I sat in a parking lot for you
and you weren't here.

00:00:58.124 --> 00:01:01.294 line:5%,start
- I was sticking up for you.
- You should have called me.

00:01:01.361 --> 00:01:03.730 line:5%,start
[MUSIC - NIKKO LOWE, "LIVING ON
THE DANCE FLOOR"]

00:01:03.797 --> 00:01:05.298 line:95%,end
(SINGING) Get up.

00:01:05.365 --> 00:01:07.333 line:95%,end
Get on the floor.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.739 line:95%,end
My world is with my girls,
living on the dance floor.

00:01:12.806 --> 00:01:14.808 line:95%,end
[music continues]

00:01:18.178 --> 00:01:19.412 line:5%,start
All right.

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.081 line:95%,end
Let's rock and roll.

00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:22.615 line:95%,end
Hello.

00:01:22.682 --> 00:01:24.584 line:95%,end
It's apparent that Christi
and Chloe are not here.

00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:26.119 line:5%,start
They were suspended last week.

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:29.055 line:5%,start
We need Christi and Chloe
as part of the team.

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:30.590 line:95%,end
They are part of the team.

00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:33.159 line:95%,end
Without them, the team's not complete.

00:01:33.226 --> 00:01:34.894 line:95%,end
So Kelly, have you talked to Christi?

00:01:34.961 --> 00:01:36.162 line:95%,end
No. She won't call me.

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:37.664 line:95%,end
I hope she comes back.

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.600 line:95%,end
Have you talked to Christi?

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:43.570 line:95%,end
You know, I talked her
for a few moments yesterday.

00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:45.205 line:95%,end
Just for a little bit, not very long.

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:46.840 line:95%,end
Did she mention my name at all?

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:48.842 line:95%,end
She did not.

00:01:50.376 --> 00:01:51.911 line:5%,start
It's going to be really awkward this week

00:01:51.978 --> 00:01:54.247 line:5%,start
because, you know,
I tried calling Christi.

00:01:54.314 --> 00:01:55.682 line:5%,start
I tried texting her.

00:01:55.748 --> 00:01:56.950 line:95%,end
She didn't answer me back.

00:01:57.383 --> 00:01:59.552 line:95%,end
So, I don't even know what to say to her.

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.021 line:95%,end
OK, you're sure
you want to go back in there?

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.392 line:95%,end
I want to walk into that studio
like I want a stiletto jammed

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:07.660 line:95%,end
in my eyeball.

00:02:07.727 --> 00:02:09.929 line:5%,start
But we're back
because Chloe wants to dance,

00:02:09.996 --> 00:02:11.931 line:5%,start
and I don't do this for myself.

00:02:11.998 --> 00:02:13.633 line:95%,end
I do it for my daughter.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.001 line:95%,end
Hello.

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:16.836 line:95%,end
Hi.

00:02:20.206 --> 00:02:23.276 line:95%,end
May I speak with you in private?

00:02:24.344 --> 00:02:25.512 line:95%,end
[screams]

00:02:25.578 --> 00:02:27.147 line:95%,end
Chloe.

00:02:27.213 --> 00:02:28.748 line:95%,end
Chloe.

00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:30.550 line:95%,end
Wow, look who's here.

00:02:30.617 --> 00:02:32.252 line:95%,end
What a welcome.

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:34.087 line:95%,end
Well, Abby, since you're
not going to speak to me,

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:35.622 line:95%,end
I'm going to speak at you.

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:39.425 line:95%,end
Chloe is here
because she's a member of the team.

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.563 line:95%,end
I am sorry for my behavior in the hallway

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:44.998 line:95%,end
and at the competition.

00:02:45.532 --> 00:02:48.334 line:95%,end
And I have talked to the competition.

00:02:48.401 --> 00:02:50.637 line:95%,end
I've apologized.
I've spoken to the director.

00:02:50.703 --> 00:02:52.639 line:95%,end
And you should, in no way, shape, or form,

00:02:52.705 --> 00:02:54.207 line:95%,end
hold that against Chloe.

00:02:54.274 --> 00:02:55.408 line:95%,end
[laughs]

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.111 line:95%,end
Or at least I would think
you should know that.

00:02:58.178 --> 00:02:59.812 line:95%,end
I would think your mother
would have taught you better.

00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:05.418 line:95%,end
OK, I'm going to go in
because this is my job

00:03:05.485 --> 00:03:06.986 line:95%,end
and I am to be here.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.496 line:95%,end
Hey. Hello.

00:03:16.563 --> 00:03:18.531 line:95%,end
- Hi.
- How's it going?

00:03:18.598 --> 00:03:20.867 line:95%,end
- I heard you were talking to Abby.
- No, I was talking at Abby.

00:03:20.934 --> 00:03:24.270 line:95%,end
- She won't speak to me.
- Oh. Sometimes it's better that way.

00:03:24.337 --> 00:03:26.806 line:95%,end
That woman thinks that I'm going
to give her the time of day.

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:29.275 line:95%,end
How dare her even walk into this studio.

00:03:29.342 --> 00:03:32.946 line:95%,end
She has [bleep] big [bleep] like a man,

00:03:33.012 --> 00:03:34.080 line:95%,end
because that's what she is.

00:03:34.147 --> 00:03:36.015 line:95%,end
She is disgusting.

00:03:36.082 --> 00:03:37.450 line:95%,end
Where have you been?

00:03:37.517 --> 00:03:39.018 line:95%,end
What have you been up to?

00:03:39.085 --> 00:03:41.054 line:95%,end
I don't know. We'll talk upstairs.

00:03:43.423 --> 00:03:45.358 line:95%,end
No need for applause. Let's go.

00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:46.993 line:95%,end
[laughs]

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.361 line:95%,end
When I come back in the studio,

00:03:48.428 --> 00:03:50.597 line:95%,end
everyone's really excited
to see me, except Kelly,

00:03:50.663 --> 00:03:52.398 line:95%,end
and you would think that Kelly
should've been the one


00:03:52.465 --> 00:03:53.800 line:95%,end
who is most excited to see me.

00:03:54.467 --> 00:03:55.735 line:95%,end
All right.

00:03:55.802 --> 00:03:59.405 line:95%,end
You know, they told me that
Detroit was a tough city.

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:01.808 line:95%,end
Well, it was.

00:04:02.508 --> 00:04:04.210 line:95%,end
You weren't the big winners.

00:04:04.277 --> 00:04:05.378 line:95%,end
You got beat.

00:04:05.445 --> 00:04:08.314 line:95%,end
Your champion winner will be
"Top of the World" entry number

00:04:08.381 --> 00:04:09.415 line:95%,end
89.

00:04:12.852 --> 00:04:14.187 line:95%,end
Third place.

00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:17.223 line:95%,end
Cathy is a fake and a phony.

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.259 line:95%,end
She calls herself a choreographer?

00:04:19.325 --> 00:04:23.363 line:95%,end
She's an embarrassment to my vocation.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.668 line:95%,end
I think the loss to Cathy's
all-boy team was tough on Abby.

00:04:28.735 --> 00:04:30.803 line:95%,end
To be honest with you,
I think she did not like

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.273 line:95%,end
losing to a group of all boys.

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:36.809 line:95%,end
And then we had a duet,
but I can't really talk about it

00:04:36.876 --> 00:04:38.911 line:95%,end
because it didn't happen.

00:04:38.978 --> 00:04:40.146 line:95%,end
I pulled the duet.

00:04:40.213 --> 00:04:44.684 line:95%,end
If your mother is out of control,
you don't dance.

00:04:44.751 --> 00:04:46.219 line:95%,end
And Abby, that is fine.

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:48.388 line:95%,end
I do want it noted on your record

00:04:48.454 --> 00:04:52.091 line:95%,end
that I was defending my daughter
because you were being insensitive

00:04:52.158 --> 00:04:53.493 line:95%,end
about her health issues.

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:55.662 line:95%,end
That's what my disagreement with you was.

00:04:55.728 --> 00:04:58.798 line:95%,end
So let's just say I'm not
putting up with it anymore.

00:05:01.501 --> 00:05:03.736 line:95%,end
We've had a member of the team suspended.

00:05:04.504 --> 00:05:06.039 line:95%,end
You all know what suspended is.

00:05:07.006 --> 00:05:09.609 line:95%,end
It's like the last
chance before dismissal.

00:05:11.444 --> 00:05:13.046 line:95%,end
Let's move on to the pyramid.

00:05:13.112 --> 00:05:15.982 line:95%,end
Chloe, obviously,
you were not on the pyramid.

00:05:16.482 --> 00:05:19.118 line:95%,end
On the bottom, Nia.

00:05:19.185 --> 00:05:20.653 line:95%,end
You should have expected to be there.

00:05:23.856 --> 00:05:28.261 line:95%,end
Paige kind of got thrown
under the bus with the duet.

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:32.065 line:95%,end
Next we have Kendall.

00:05:32.131 --> 00:05:34.901 line:95%,end
Now Kendall, you were given a solo.

00:05:35.301 --> 00:05:37.570 line:95%,end
You didn't even make the top 10.

00:05:37.637 --> 00:05:39.972 line:95%,end
Alexandra, "Below Zero."

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:45.445 line:95%,end
Do I just keep giving you a solo?

00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:47.246 line:95%,end
No.

00:05:47.313 --> 00:05:49.982 line:95%,end
Next, Mackenzie.

00:05:50.049 --> 00:05:52.018 line:95%,end
I told you I wasn't going
to put you in the groups anymore

00:05:52.085 --> 00:05:54.153 line:95%,end
because you are the weak link.

00:05:55.688 --> 00:05:57.557 line:95%,end
This time I thought you were excellent.

00:05:59.392 --> 00:06:02.862 line:95%,end
And moving next, Brooke.

00:06:03.429 --> 00:06:05.498 line:95%,end
It was the first time you
were officially on the team.

00:06:10.703 --> 00:06:13.306 line:95%,end
I thought the parts
that you did in the routine

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:16.075 line:95%,end
that were your solo spots were excellent.

00:06:17.477 --> 00:06:22.014 line:95%,end
But I need you still to be more
of a role model, understood?

00:06:23.883 --> 00:06:27.120 line:95%,end
And at the top of the pyramid, Maddie.

00:06:27.186 --> 00:06:29.088 line:95%,end
You have not had a solo for weeks.

00:06:29.155 --> 00:06:31.324 line:95%,end
Your highest scoring solo tonight

00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:33.826 line:95%,end
will be Maddie with "Quick Sand."

00:06:35.495 --> 00:06:37.330 line:95%,end
It's tough getting there.

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:40.099 line:95%,end
It's even tougher staying there,
and you know that.

00:06:42.301 --> 00:06:45.838 line:95%,end
We will be attending In10sity Dance

00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:47.740 line:95%,end
in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

00:06:49.308 --> 00:06:50.476 line:95%,end
[inaudible]

00:06:50.543 --> 00:06:52.812 line:95%,end
Everybody will be in the group dance.

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:55.515 line:95%,end
Now, the group routine
is a contemporary piece.

00:06:55.581 --> 00:07:01.154 line:95%,end
The name of the routine
is "Money is the Root of All Evil."

00:07:01.854 --> 00:07:03.723 line:95%,end
I really don't know
about the group routine this week,

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:05.358 line:95%,end
"Money is the Root of All Evil."

00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:07.627 line:95%,end
I don't really equate money with evil.

00:07:07.693 --> 00:07:08.694 line:95%,end
Abby, yes.

00:07:08.761 --> 00:07:10.163 line:95%,end
Money, no.

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:12.999 line:95%,end
Moms, the costumes are emerald green,

00:07:13.065 --> 00:07:15.902 line:95%,end
like the color of money or envy.

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:19.439 line:95%,end
And they're going to need some work.

00:07:19.505 --> 00:07:20.807 line:95%,end
We need headpieces.

00:07:20.873 --> 00:07:22.275 line:95%,end
We need trim.

00:07:22.341 --> 00:07:25.878 line:95%,end
And you'll be using
actual real money on the costume.

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:28.848 line:95%,end
I don't know about this idea
of putting real money

00:07:28.915 --> 00:07:29.982 line:95%,end
on these costumes.

00:07:30.049 --> 00:07:32.585 line:95%,end
We spend enough money
on costumes as it is.

00:07:32.652 --> 00:07:34.754 line:95%,end
This is going to be an expensive week.

00:07:34.821 --> 00:07:39.725 line:95%,end
Maddie, obviously, a solo is going to you.

00:07:39.792 --> 00:07:43.029 line:95%,end
And the other solo is going to Brooke.

00:07:43.429 --> 00:07:44.964 line:95%,end
[applause]


00:07:45.031 --> 00:07:47.967 line:95%,end
This is Brooke's first solo
for this competition season,

00:07:48.034 --> 00:07:49.402 line:95%,end
and Brooke needs the show Abby

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:51.471 line:95%,end
that she wants to be part of this team.

00:07:51.537 --> 00:07:53.339 line:95%,end
I think she needs to go out there
and show her

00:07:53.406 --> 00:07:56.476 line:95%,end
that she still loves to dance
and she wants to be here.

00:07:56.542 --> 00:07:57.944 line:95%,end
We have a lot of work to do.

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:01.280 line:95%,end
Moms, go ahead and go upstairs.

00:08:01.347 --> 00:08:03.483 line:95%,end
Spread apart. We're doing a whole warm-up.

00:08:06.619 --> 00:08:08.521 line:5%,start
Now ladies, think about this.

00:08:08.588 --> 00:08:10.289 line:5%,start
It's bluesy

00:08:10.356 --> 00:08:16.596 line:5%,start
so think of being in a speakeasy
or a nightclub.

00:08:16.662 --> 00:08:18.598 line:5%,start
"Money is the Root of All Evil"

00:08:18.664 --> 00:08:20.700 line:5%,start
is the name of our routine this week.

00:08:20.766 --> 00:08:23.302 line:5%,start
Now, the routine is contemporary,

00:08:23.369 --> 00:08:25.538 line:5%,start
but it has a little bit
of flamboyancy to it

00:08:26.038 --> 00:08:29.308 line:5%,start
and we're going to use real money
all over the costumes.

00:08:29.375 --> 00:08:33.012 line:95%,end
The faces have to come through,
and we need to bring it all

00:08:33.079 --> 00:08:35.781 line:95%,end
or we'll be counting the chump change
on the way home.

00:08:35.848 --> 00:08:37.083 line:95%,end
Make it bigger.

00:08:37.149 --> 00:08:39.685 line:95%,end
5, 6, 7, go.

00:08:39.752 --> 00:08:42.088 line:95%,end
Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.

00:08:42.154 --> 00:08:44.056 line:95%,end
Don't steal Maddie's pose.

00:08:44.123 --> 00:08:46.692 line:95%,end
Of course our kids do not
go to speakeasies or bars.

00:08:46.759 --> 00:08:48.394 line:95%,end
I don't know what a speakeasy is.

00:08:48.461 --> 00:08:52.865 line:95%,end
OK, a speakeasy, also called
a blind pig or blind tiger,

00:08:52.932 --> 00:08:55.234 line:95%,end
is an establishment that illegally

00:08:55.301 --> 00:08:57.303 line:95%,end
sells alcoholic beverages.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:01.340 line:95%,end
Such establishments came into
prominence in the United States

00:09:01.407 --> 00:09:02.975 line:95%,end
during the period known as Prohibition.

00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:04.210 line:95%,end
I don't go to any that are illegal.

00:09:04.277 --> 00:09:05.511 line:95%,end
1920 to 1933.

00:09:05.578 --> 00:09:06.979 line:95%,end
[laughter]

00:09:07.046 --> 00:09:08.981 line:95%,end
Oh, [inaudible] illegal.

00:09:09.048 --> 00:09:12.385 line:95%,end
At one point, Kelly,
alcohol was prohibited.

00:09:12.451 --> 00:09:16.088 line:95%,end
So that's why our kids have
never been to a speakeasy.

00:09:16.155 --> 00:09:17.723 line:95%,end
Besides the fact that they are under age

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:18.958 line:95%,end
and they wouldn't go into a bar.

00:09:19.025 --> 00:09:20.326 line:95%,end
Yeah, but there's no
such thing as a speakeasy.

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:23.062 line:95%,end
- 90 years ago.
- Yeah, it doesn't exist.

00:09:23.129 --> 00:09:25.631 line:95%,end
I have to say, you know,
I wasn't here last week

00:09:25.698 --> 00:09:27.199 line:95%,end
and all of a sudden like I haven't

00:09:27.266 --> 00:09:29.435 line:95%,end
felt more like an
outsider in my life here.

00:09:30.303 --> 00:09:34.674 line:95%,end
It was a pretty quiet week relatively,
I would say, up until Saturday.

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:37.643 line:95%,end
And Saturday it was like
I was in a Twilight Zone.

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:39.045 line:95%,end
It was bizarre.

00:09:39.111 --> 00:09:40.246 line:95%,end
Just shut your mouth.

00:09:40.313 --> 00:09:42.048 line:95%,end
I didn't mean to do that.

00:09:42.114 --> 00:09:43.716 line:95%,end
I didn't mean to do that, either.

00:09:43.783 --> 00:09:44.917 line:95%,end
Get out.

00:09:44.984 --> 00:09:47.019 line:95%,end
You are a monstrosity of evil.

00:09:47.086 --> 00:09:48.321 line:95%,end
You're done. No duet.

00:09:48.387 --> 00:09:49.422 line:95%,end
It was bad.

00:09:49.488 --> 00:09:50.890 line:95%,end
I thought Saturday was just
a horrendous day all around.

00:09:50.957 --> 00:09:53.793 line:95%,end
So why weren't you answering
any of my phone calls

00:09:53.859 --> 00:09:55.494 line:95%,end
or my texts all week?

00:09:56.195 --> 00:09:58.230 line:95%,end
You called me once and I missed it.

00:09:58.297 --> 00:10:00.166 line:95%,end
And I texted you a few times.

00:10:00.232 --> 00:10:02.201 line:95%,end
- No you didn't.
- Yeah, I did.

00:10:02.268 --> 00:10:04.070 line:95%,end
- Did I answer?
- No.

00:10:04.136 --> 00:10:06.539 line:95%,end
Then I must not have gotten it
because I answer your texts.

00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:08.307 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: So why didn't you call me?

00:10:08.374 --> 00:10:09.942 line:95%,end
I was having a bad week

00:10:10.009 --> 00:10:13.913 line:95%,end
and I just was waiting for you to call,
and if I missed one call then

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.215 line:95%,end
I'm sorry.

00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:18.451 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: 5, 6, 7, go.

00:10:18.517 --> 00:10:20.286 line:95%,end
Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, in.

00:10:21.153 --> 00:10:22.555 line:95%,end
Too late, Mackenzie.

00:10:22.622 --> 00:10:25.291 line:95%,end
I want you to be looking
to the side, the floor,

00:10:25.358 --> 00:10:27.093 line:95%,end
the opposite direction.

00:10:28.127 --> 00:10:29.996 line:95%,end
Go ahead, chit chat away.

00:10:32.331 --> 00:10:34.100 line:95%,end
So what just went on right there?

00:10:34.166 --> 00:10:35.568 line:95%,end
I asked her why she didn't
answer my phone calls.

00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:37.103 line:95%,end
What did she say?

00:10:37.169 --> 00:10:40.106 line:95%,end
She said she only got one
and I didn't leave a message.

00:10:40.172 --> 00:10:41.340 line:95%,end
I never leave her a message.

00:10:41.407 --> 00:10:43.109 line:95%,end
When you see that you missed the call,

00:10:43.175 --> 00:10:44.443 line:95%,end
you can really just call back.

00:10:45.177 --> 00:10:48.414 line:95%,end
The "I'm-having-a-bad-week" thing
isn't cutting it.

00:10:49.515 --> 00:10:50.650 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: You know,
I'm going to sit up here

00:10:50.716 --> 00:10:52.351 line:95%,end
because I'm not playing games.

00:10:52.418 --> 00:10:53.552 line:95%,end
I'm not.

00:10:53.619 --> 00:10:57.089 line:95%,end
KELLY: I'm just saying
how I don't understand

00:10:57.156 --> 00:10:58.591 line:95%,end
why you were mad at me.

00:10:58.658 --> 00:10:59.925 line:95%,end
I was mad at you about what happened

00:10:59.992 --> 00:11:01.694 line:95%,end
and I was waiting for you to call me

00:11:01.761 --> 00:11:03.062 line:95%,end
because of all this that was going on.

00:11:03.129 --> 00:11:04.597 line:95%,end
I was just waiting
for you to reach out to me.

00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:06.265 line:95%,end
And I did.

00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:07.466 line:95%,end
I'm not going to play with you about it.

00:11:07.533 --> 00:11:10.770 line:95%,end
My feelings were hurt
because you know how about this sucks.

00:11:10.836 --> 00:11:12.238 line:95%,end
All I wanted was a phone call from you.

00:11:12.304 --> 00:11:13.873 line:95%,end
That's all, Kelly.

00:11:13.939 --> 00:11:14.940 line:95%,end
When you were going through [bleep],,

00:11:15.007 --> 00:11:16.375 line:95%,end
- I called you every day.
- I did call you.

00:11:16.442 --> 00:11:18.244 line:95%,end
- On Friday.
- No, I didn't.

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:22.915 line:95%,end
I called you Sunday at the competition,
the day you left.

00:11:22.982 --> 00:11:24.116 line:95%,end
Yeah, you called me
you said, oh, are you OK?

00:11:24.183 --> 00:11:25.685 line:95%,end
I miss my partner in crime.

00:11:25.751 --> 00:11:27.553 line:95%,end
That's all I wanted from you, Kelly.

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:29.221 line:95%,end
That's all.

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:32.191 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:11:32.258 --> 00:11:33.526 line:95%,end
Let's go.


00:11:35.961 --> 00:11:38.230 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:11:44.203 --> 00:11:46.439 line:5%,start
I'll tell you what, when I left,

00:11:46.505 --> 00:11:50.743 line:5%,start
there was tension between you,
Melissa, and Abby and Maddie.

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:52.945 line:95%,end
And it's like I came back
and I feel like I'm back

00:11:53.012 --> 00:11:55.715 line:95%,end
and everything is back to normal.

00:11:55.781 --> 00:11:57.817 line:95%,end
Like Maddie's featured in the dance.

00:11:57.883 --> 00:11:59.285 line:95%,end
She's happy. Abby's pleased with her.

00:11:59.351 --> 00:12:01.420 line:95%,end
You seem like you're back
on good terms with Abby.

00:12:01.487 --> 00:12:03.255 line:95%,end
- Like what happened there?
- I don't know.

00:12:03.322 --> 00:12:06.625 line:95%,end
I mean, I, you know, argue
and then things get better.

00:12:06.692 --> 00:12:09.295 line:95%,end
I just think it's because
she knows this is her team

00:12:09.361 --> 00:12:13.099 line:95%,end
and, you know, we all need
each other and she needs us.

00:12:13.165 --> 00:12:15.801 line:95%,end
Do you think it's
maybe because Sophia decided

00:12:15.868 --> 00:12:17.169 line:95%,end
she didn't want to be part of our team

00:12:17.236 --> 00:12:19.438 line:95%,end
and she realized
that Maddie is what she got?

00:12:19.505 --> 00:12:21.107 line:95%,end
Oh, yeah.

00:12:21.173 --> 00:12:22.775 line:95%,end
I mean, Sophia's not here anymore

00:12:22.842 --> 00:12:25.511 line:95%,end
and she knows that this is her team.

00:12:27.179 --> 00:12:29.348 line:5%,start
It might be back to normal
for Melissa and Maddie,

00:12:29.415 --> 00:12:31.550 line:5%,start
but it's certainly not back
to normal for Kelly and I.

00:12:31.617 --> 00:12:32.718 line:95%,end
We're barely talking.

00:12:32.785 --> 00:12:35.321 line:95%,end
I mean, we're not really
even making eye contact.

00:12:36.055 --> 00:12:39.525 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER:
Oh, your knee's bent, Paige,

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:41.727 line:95%,end
because you should be
on the outside of Nia.

00:12:41.794 --> 00:12:44.363 line:95%,end
Let's move Kendall back in
and pull her up a little taller.

00:12:46.132 --> 00:12:48.667 line:95%,end
You, girl in the front,
move over to the right.

00:12:48.734 --> 00:12:50.035 line:95%,end
You shouldn't be center.

00:12:50.102 --> 00:12:51.137 line:95%,end
Move.

00:12:51.203 --> 00:12:52.905 line:95%,end
Abby won't refer to Chloe by her name.

00:12:52.972 --> 00:12:55.674 line:95%,end
She keeps calling her
"that girl" or "her" or "she."

00:12:55.741 --> 00:12:58.811 line:95%,end
I mean, like how belittling
can you get to not even say

00:12:58.878 --> 00:12:59.979 line:95%,end
someone's name?

00:13:00.045 --> 00:13:03.182 line:5%,start
I want to teach Chloe
you can't take anything for granted,

00:13:03.249 --> 00:13:05.117 line:5%,start
because even if you're gone,

00:13:05.184 --> 00:13:06.652 line:5%,start
the show must go on.

00:13:07.153 --> 00:13:10.823 line:95%,end
So Chloe, if you want me
to remember your name,

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:14.059 line:95%,end
then you need to prove it to me.
Make me remember.

00:13:14.126 --> 00:13:16.061 line:95%,end
All right, we're going to break right now.

00:13:16.128 --> 00:13:19.398 line:95%,end
You have one more day to work
on this dance and that's it,

00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:20.499 line:95%,end
one more day.

00:13:20.566 --> 00:13:22.034 line:95%,end
Thank you.

00:13:22.101 --> 00:13:24.703 line:95%,end
Kel, come on. Come with me to go
get the supplies.

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:26.205 line:95%,end
- Will you come help me?
- KELLY: Yeah.

00:13:26.272 --> 00:13:27.606 line:5%,start
I'm really concerned about what's going on

00:13:27.673 --> 00:13:28.874 line:5%,start
with Kelly and Christi.

00:13:28.941 --> 00:13:30.109 line:95%,end
It's crazy.

00:13:30.176 --> 00:13:32.745 line:95%,end
So I'm going to ask her
to come down to the costume shop.

00:13:32.812 --> 00:13:34.980 line:95%,end
This is my opportunity to find out

00:13:35.047 --> 00:13:36.949 line:95%,end
what's going on between Kelly and Christi

00:13:37.016 --> 00:13:38.017 line:95%,end
and maybe I can help out.

00:13:38.083 --> 00:13:40.452 line:95%,end
So what's going on with you and Christi?

00:13:40.519 --> 00:13:42.188 line:95%,end
Nothing.

00:13:42.254 --> 00:13:43.923 line:95%,end
She still isn't talking to me.

00:13:43.989 --> 00:13:48.494 line:95%,end
Melissa, I didn't do anything wrong,
and I tried calling her.

00:13:48.894 --> 00:13:49.929 line:95%,end
I told her that today.

00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:52.731 line:95%,end
I tried. I'm not doing it again.

00:13:52.798 --> 00:13:53.933 line:95%,end
And I don't want to get in
the middle of it, you know.

00:13:53.999 --> 00:13:55.467 line:95%,end
Don't.

00:13:55.534 --> 00:13:57.570 line:95%,end
I don't expect you to guy
to get in the middle,

00:13:57.636 --> 00:13:59.939 line:95%,end
but I tried calling her.

00:14:00.005 --> 00:14:02.274 line:95%,end
She sent me to voicemail.
She did not return my phone call.

00:14:02.341 --> 00:14:04.109 line:95%,end
- I'm done.
- It is what it is.

00:14:04.176 --> 00:14:05.110 line:95%,end
She just has to get over it.

00:14:05.177 --> 00:14:07.346 line:95%,end
And you didn't do anything wrong.

00:14:07.413 --> 00:14:09.882 line:95%,end
I mean, we all have done,
said things to each other

00:14:09.949 --> 00:14:11.784 line:95%,end
to hurt each other's feelings.

00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:12.818 line:95%,end
KELLY: Exactly.

00:14:12.885 --> 00:14:14.620 line:95%,end
Let's get on with life. Okay, come on.

00:14:14.687 --> 00:14:16.055 line:95%,end
Let's go.

00:14:20.459 --> 00:14:21.794 line:95%,end
[crying]

00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:22.962 line:5%,start
What did she say?

00:14:25.898 --> 00:14:27.533 line:95%,end
And she's being really mean to her.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:31.103 line:5%,start
During rehearsal, Miss Abby
really isn't acknowledging me

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:33.873 line:5%,start
and saying my name,
and that really hurts my feelings

00:14:33.939 --> 00:14:36.842 line:5%,start
because I'm still a person.

00:14:36.909 --> 00:14:38.277 line:95%,end
Oh, Chloe.

00:14:39.245 --> 00:14:41.647 line:95%,end
Abby's refusing to say
Chloe's name because she feels

00:14:41.714 --> 00:14:42.982 line:95%,end
that if she doesn't say Chloe's name,

00:14:43.048 --> 00:14:45.017 line:95%,end
she takes away her importance.

00:14:47.586 --> 00:14:49.221 line:95%,end
Don't give her that satisfaction, Chloe.

00:14:49.288 --> 00:14:51.056 line:95%,end
Don't give her the power to upset you.

00:14:51.123 --> 00:14:52.224 line:95%,end
Are you OK?

00:14:52.291 --> 00:14:53.392 line:95%,end
Yeah.

00:14:53.459 --> 00:14:54.593 line:95%,end
You sure?

00:14:55.294 --> 00:14:57.096 line:95%,end
You're my daughter.

00:14:57.162 --> 00:14:59.431 line:95%,end
Come on, you got a
little bit of me in you.

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:01.367 line:95%,end
Buck up.

00:15:07.039 --> 00:15:08.340 line:5%,start
Hurry up.

00:15:09.475 --> 00:15:10.509 line:5%,start
Can't forget what to do there.

00:15:10.576 --> 00:15:11.744 line:5%,start
You can screw yourself up.

00:15:12.378 --> 00:15:14.847 line:5%,start
My solo this week is called "Careless,"


00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:16.682 line:5%,start
and it's a lyrical number.

00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:19.818 line:95%,end
Abby gave this to me
because she knows I could care less

00:15:19.885 --> 00:15:23.188 line:95%,end
about dance, so that is
why I'm doing this solo.

00:15:23.255 --> 00:15:24.456 line:95%,end
Don't d velopp .

00:15:24.523 --> 00:15:25.858 line:95%,end
Just hold it and pull your head through.

00:15:26.392 --> 00:15:27.826 line:95%,end
Now come down.

00:15:27.893 --> 00:15:29.461 line:95%,end
Watch your alignment coming down.

00:15:29.528 --> 00:15:30.963 line:95%,end
You're not straightening that right knee.

00:15:31.764 --> 00:15:32.898 line:95%,end
Pull your feet. Pull your feet.

00:15:32.965 --> 00:15:34.566 line:95%,end
Your feet, your feet, your feet.

00:15:36.602 --> 00:15:38.971 line:95%,end
Abby doesn't teach her her dance early.

00:15:39.038 --> 00:15:41.507 line:5%,start
She doesn't give her a lot
of time during rehearsal.

00:15:42.141 --> 00:15:44.109 line:5%,start
She gives her a song called "Careless"

00:15:44.176 --> 00:15:47.846 line:5%,start
that makes Brooke feel like
I guess I should care less.

00:15:47.913 --> 00:15:49.381 line:95%,end
It just feels like she's setting her up.

00:15:49.448 --> 00:15:52.551 line:95%,end
I just want you to work hard and care

00:15:52.618 --> 00:15:54.553 line:95%,end
about whatever it is you want to do.

00:15:54.954 --> 00:15:58.524 line:95%,end
Don't just be the average kid
that falls through the cracks.

00:15:58.824 --> 00:16:02.194 line:95%,end
Don't do anything half bleep.

00:16:02.261 --> 00:16:03.996 line:95%,end
- Okay.
- All right, you're finished.

00:16:04.063 --> 00:16:05.030 line:95%,end
Thank you.

00:16:05.097 --> 00:16:06.498 line:95%,end
Go ahead and rest.

00:16:06.565 --> 00:16:08.167 line:95%,end
Old ladies need lots of rest.

00:16:08.233 --> 00:16:10.302 line:95%,end
Am I trying to jab her a little bit?

00:16:10.369 --> 00:16:11.804 line:95%,end
Absolutely.

00:16:12.171 --> 00:16:16.008 line:95%,end
Brooke, do you care
or could you care less?

00:16:17.009 --> 00:16:18.344 line:95%,end
We'll see.

00:16:19.345 --> 00:16:23.048 line:5%,start
I'm pretty sad that we didn't
get to do the duet last weekend

00:16:23.115 --> 00:16:26.819 line:5%,start
because we did all that work,
so I definitely

00:16:26.885 --> 00:16:27.953 line:5%,start
want to do the duet.

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:31.090 line:95%,end
I'm going to go in
and ask Abby if we can do the duet,

00:16:31.156 --> 00:16:32.925 line:95%,end
because there's only three numbers

00:16:32.992 --> 00:16:34.760 line:95%,end
and there's usually four.

00:16:35.461 --> 00:16:38.597 line:5%,start
Nia wants to go ask Miss Abby
if we can do our duet this week,

00:16:38.664 --> 00:16:40.366 line:5%,start
and I'm very terrified for her

00:16:40.432 --> 00:16:42.368 line:5%,start
because Abby can be
a little scary at times.

00:16:45.904 --> 00:16:48.941 line:95%,end
Who's that big girl,
doing it all on her own?

00:16:49.008 --> 00:16:50.676 line:5%,start
Last week, Abby pulled Nia's duet

00:16:50.743 --> 00:16:53.379 line:5%,start
right before it was about to go on
and Nia was devastated.

00:16:53.445 --> 00:16:55.748 line:95%,end
You are a monstrosity of evil.

00:16:55.814 --> 00:16:57.549 line:95%,end
You want to talk about ugliness?

00:16:57.616 --> 00:16:58.884 line:95%,end
You're done. You're done.

00:16:58.951 --> 00:17:00.386 line:95%,end
No duet.
- Whatever.

00:17:00.452 --> 00:17:01.787 line:95%,end
I'm a monstrosity of evil?

00:17:01.854 --> 00:17:03.589 line:95%,end
Abby giveth. Abby taketh away.

00:17:06.125 --> 00:17:08.794 line:95%,end
Nia is determined this week
to get that duet back,

00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:11.063 line:95%,end
and she's going to be herself
and asked for it.

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:13.999 line:95%,end
I wanted to ask you if Paige and I

00:17:14.066 --> 00:17:15.601 line:95%,end
can do the duet this weekend.

00:17:17.469 --> 00:17:18.537 line:95%,end
Uh--

00:17:18.604 --> 00:17:20.739 line:95%,end
Nia is asking me herself.

00:17:20.806 --> 00:17:22.875 line:95%,end
Her mother isn't speaking for her.

00:17:22.941 --> 00:17:26.045 line:95%,end
She's acting mature
and taking matters into her own hands.

00:17:26.111 --> 00:17:29.081 line:95%,end
Nia, that's exactly what I want to see.

00:17:29.148 --> 00:17:30.516 line:95%,end
You've got my attention.

00:17:32.317 --> 00:17:33.285 line:95%,end
Let me think about it.

00:17:33.352 --> 00:17:34.520 line:95%,end
I'm not saying no.

00:17:34.586 --> 00:17:35.621 line:95%,end
You understand that?

00:17:36.121 --> 00:17:37.156 line:95%,end
- Okay.
- Let's go.

00:17:37.589 --> 00:17:39.591 line:95%,end
It's not a yes. It's not a no.

00:17:40.292 --> 00:17:41.760 line:95%,end
This is so stressful.

00:17:43.195 --> 00:17:45.097 line:95%,end
It's not even me and I feel stressed.

00:17:52.071 --> 00:17:53.205 line:95%,end
Thanks for meeting me.

00:17:53.272 --> 00:17:55.541 line:95%,end
Yeah, and I tried to text you
as much as I can.

00:17:55.607 --> 00:17:56.675 line:95%,end
No, I know.

00:17:56.742 --> 00:17:57.843 line:95%,end
And you know what, Melissa?

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:01.413 line:95%,end
We don't get along
or see eye to eye on everything.

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:02.714 line:95%,end
You were the first one to call me.

00:18:02.781 --> 00:18:03.849 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I was worried about you.

00:18:03.916 --> 00:18:07.219 line:95%,end
Tonight I'm having drinks
with Christi, which is very odd,

00:18:07.719 --> 00:18:09.588 line:95%,end
but I have to do what I have to do.

00:18:09.655 --> 00:18:13.158 line:95%,end
Kelly's angry with me
and I don't know why.

00:18:13.225 --> 00:18:14.359 line:95%,end
She's stubborn.

00:18:14.426 --> 00:18:15.828 line:95%,end
Yeah.

00:18:15.894 --> 00:18:17.129 line:95%,end
I was like her biggest cheerleader,

00:18:17.196 --> 00:18:19.398 line:95%,end
and I'm having a bad time.

00:18:19.465 --> 00:18:21.266 line:95%,end
Why have I not gotten any texts?

00:18:21.333 --> 00:18:22.301 line:95%,end
It's like you broke up.

00:18:22.367 --> 00:18:27.206 line:95%,end
Melissa, I have been
a part of this team forever.

00:18:27.272 --> 00:18:30.676 line:95%,end
And like this week,
I feel like an outsider.

00:18:30.742 --> 00:18:32.878 line:95%,end
I feel bad for the whole situation.

00:18:32.945 --> 00:18:36.849 line:95%,end
You know, Melissa, we aren't
always the best of friends.

00:18:36.915 --> 00:18:37.850 line:95%,end
[laughs]

00:18:37.916 --> 00:18:38.951 line:95%,end
No.

00:18:39.017 --> 00:18:41.487 line:95%,end
But thank you for meeting me.

00:18:41.553 --> 00:18:42.554 line:95%,end
- Thank you.
- Of course.

00:18:42.621 --> 00:18:44.723 line:95%,end
- You know, I worry about you.
- I appreciate it.

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:47.526 line:95%,end
I think deep down,
Melissa's being a better friend to me

00:18:47.593 --> 00:18:49.061 line:95%,end
at this point than Kelly is.


00:18:55.801 --> 00:18:59.037 line:95%,end
So you know the name of the routine
is "You Don't Know Me."

00:18:59.104 --> 00:19:01.073 line:95%,end
Do the judges know who you are?

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:02.708 line:95%,end
So maybe they've heard of you,

00:19:02.774 --> 00:19:04.209 line:95%,end
maybe they know your reputation.

00:19:04.276 --> 00:19:05.711 line:95%,end
They think they know who you are.

00:19:05.777 --> 00:19:06.812 line:95%,end
Oh, Maddie, we know her.

00:19:06.879 --> 00:19:08.380 line:95%,end
Oh, yeah, Maddie, I've heard of her.

00:19:08.447 --> 00:19:11.917 line:5%,start
No, we're trying to tell them
who the real Maddie is.

00:19:12.584 --> 00:19:15.654 line:5%,start
Maddie's solo this week is called
"You Don't Know Me."

00:19:15.721 --> 00:19:18.357 line:5%,start
It's a little bit edgier for Maddie.

00:19:18.423 --> 00:19:19.925 line:5%,start
Nice.

00:19:19.992 --> 00:19:22.661 line:5%,start
Like you think you know "who Maddie is."

00:19:23.529 --> 00:19:24.730 line:95%,end
Push.

00:19:24.796 --> 00:19:26.331 line:95%,end
She's very angelic.

00:19:26.398 --> 00:19:29.234 line:95%,end
She does these lyrical routines
that are so pretty.

00:19:33.105 --> 00:19:35.774 line:95%,end
Maddie is going to prove to everybody
that they don't know

00:19:35.841 --> 00:19:36.975 line:95%,end
who she is.

00:19:37.042 --> 00:19:38.777 line:95%,end
She's more than you think.

00:19:38.844 --> 00:19:40.445 line:95%,end
Hey, come on, Paige, Nia.

00:19:40.512 --> 00:19:42.281 line:95%,end
Now remember, girls, this is the duet.

00:19:42.347 --> 00:19:44.383 line:95%,end
You asked me to do it. I pulled it.

00:19:44.449 --> 00:19:46.552 line:95%,end
You've had two weeks to do this number,

00:19:46.618 --> 00:19:50.722 line:95%,end
so it should look twice as good
as Maddie's solo,

00:19:50.789 --> 00:19:52.291 line:95%,end
twice as good as Brooke's solo.

00:19:52.357 --> 00:19:54.159 line:95%,end
They've been doing their dances for a day.

00:19:54.226 --> 00:19:55.427 line:95%,end
You've had an entire week.

00:19:55.494 --> 00:19:56.495 line:95%,end
Let's go.

00:19:56.562 --> 00:19:59.965 line:5%,start
Yesterday, Nia and Paige came
to me and asked if they could do

00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:03.402 line:5%,start
last week's cancelled duet
in this week's competition.

00:20:03.869 --> 00:20:06.872 line:5%,start
I want to see the performance
before I make my final decision.

00:20:06.939 --> 00:20:08.507 line:95%,end
Does the routine look good?

00:20:08.574 --> 00:20:10.742 line:95%,end
I don't know,
but I'm giving them the opportunity.

00:20:10.809 --> 00:20:13.045 line:95%,end
So come on, girls, impress me.

00:20:13.512 --> 00:20:15.981 line:95%,end
Every time you do that kick,
get your leg higher.

00:20:16.048 --> 00:20:17.683 line:95%,end
You're not thinking.

00:20:17.749 --> 00:20:20.185 line:95%,end
That's what I'm saying, you guys want
to do this-- oh, we want to do the duet.

00:20:20.252 --> 00:20:21.787 line:95%,end
It's fun. We want to do it.

00:20:21.887 --> 00:20:23.288 line:95%,end
You cannot go out there

00:20:23.355 --> 00:20:26.391 line:95%,end
and look any less of a dancer than Maddie.

00:20:28.727 --> 00:20:30.462 line:95%,end
Oh, you want both of us?
She said both of us.

00:20:30.529 --> 00:20:32.864 line:95%,end
- She wants both of us down there.
- Oh, crap.

00:20:32.931 --> 00:20:36.335 line:5%,start
I think there should be closure to
last week's experience at the competition

00:20:36.401 --> 00:20:37.769 line:5%,start
and the girls should do the duet.

00:20:37.836 --> 00:20:41.707 line:5%,start
I think that would be a nice way
to resolve the situation.

00:20:41.773 --> 00:20:44.710 line:95%,end
Kind of do some Abby psychology,
thinking about how you're going

00:20:44.776 --> 00:20:46.011 line:95%,end
to approach this situation.

00:20:46.078 --> 00:20:49.081 line:95%,end
The girls have asked me about
during the duet this weekend.

00:20:49.147 --> 00:20:50.449 line:95%,end
So we're doing the duet?

00:20:50.515 --> 00:20:52.517 line:95%,end
Yes. You have to do it.

00:20:52.584 --> 00:20:53.619 line:95%,end
You're going to go out there
and you're going to do it.

00:20:53.685 --> 00:20:56.588 line:95%,end
But I explained to Nia
that I pulled the duet

00:20:56.655 --> 00:20:59.324 line:95%,end
because I could not have
that behavior go on.

00:20:59.391 --> 00:21:02.961 line:95%,end
Like you said a pyramid,
other things have happened in the past.

00:21:03.028 --> 00:21:05.864 line:95%,end
We can't go backwards,
and I'm not going to,

00:21:05.931 --> 00:21:08.267 line:95%,end
but I am going to go forward.

00:21:08.333 --> 00:21:12.771 line:95%,end
And going forward,
that behavior will not be tolerated.

00:21:12.838 --> 00:21:15.107 line:95%,end
The girls came.
They asked me.

00:21:15.173 --> 00:21:16.241 line:95%,end
Paige was part of it, too.

00:21:16.308 --> 00:21:17.776 line:95%,end
They wanted to do it.

00:21:17.843 --> 00:21:19.745 line:95%,end
So you know what you're
getting yourselves into.

00:21:19.811 --> 00:21:20.846 line:95%,end
You have to do it.

00:21:20.912 --> 00:21:24.182 line:95%,end
I don't care what the results are
for this competition, of this duet.

00:21:24.249 --> 00:21:27.686 line:95%,end
At this point, Nia has already won.

00:21:27.753 --> 00:21:29.521 line:95%,end
The duet is going on stage.

00:21:29.588 --> 00:21:31.490 line:95%,end
She's going to get to perform it.

00:21:31.556 --> 00:21:33.925 line:95%,end
And I see maturity in Nia.


00:21:33.992 --> 00:21:36.228 line:95%,end
They asked me to do it, sink or swim.

00:21:36.928 --> 00:21:38.563 line:95%,end
Hey, we're going to Florida.

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:39.765 line:95%,end
There's sharks.

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:43.568 line:95%,end
What's going on with you and Kel?

00:21:43.635 --> 00:21:45.704 line:95%,end
Have you had a chance
to sit down and work it out?

00:21:45.771 --> 00:21:50.175 line:95%,end
No, but I keep going back
to when Kelly wasn't here,

00:21:50.242 --> 00:21:52.110 line:95%,end
who was the biggest advocate
for her to come back?

00:21:52.177 --> 00:21:53.278 line:95%,end
I know.

00:21:53.345 --> 00:21:54.946 line:95%,end
I had a bad week.

00:21:55.013 --> 00:21:58.917 line:95%,end
I needed someone to call me
and she didn't call me.

00:21:58.984 --> 00:22:02.454 line:95%,end
I know, it's like a double
whammy that Kelly's mad at you.

00:22:02.521 --> 00:22:04.489 line:95%,end
Because let's face,
that would be her sitting here

00:22:04.556 --> 00:22:05.557 line:95%,end
consoling you.

00:22:05.624 --> 00:22:09.361 line:95%,end
My feelings are hurt
because when it was Kelly in my situation,

00:22:09.428 --> 00:22:10.696 line:95%,end
I was her biggest cheerleader.

00:22:10.762 --> 00:22:12.397 line:95%,end
So where do you go from here?

00:22:12.464 --> 00:22:15.133 line:95%,end
I mean, do you continue to not speak?

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.268 line:5%,start
I don't know.

00:22:16.335 --> 00:22:19.471 line:5%,start
Last week was an extremely
hard week for me and Chloe.

00:22:19.538 --> 00:22:21.306 line:95%,end
And Melissa called me.

00:22:21.373 --> 00:22:22.374 line:95%,end
Holly called me.

00:22:22.441 --> 00:22:23.508 line:95%,end
Jill called me.

00:22:23.575 --> 00:22:24.710 line:95%,end
Kelly never called me.

00:22:26.945 --> 00:22:28.513 line:95%,end
I don't know. I am a mess.

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:30.649 line:95%,end
I wasn't myself.

00:22:30.716 --> 00:22:32.117 line:95%,end
I left. I came back.

00:22:32.184 --> 00:22:33.251 line:95%,end
I felt more like myself.

00:22:33.318 --> 00:22:36.154 line:95%,end
But like I'm the snarky
bitch of the group.

00:22:36.221 --> 00:22:37.155 line:95%,end
I'm not the crier.

00:22:37.222 --> 00:22:41.393 line:95%,end
I'm not the emotional one,
and I feel so out of sorts.

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:43.195 line:95%,end
I really feel like an outsider this week.

00:22:43.261 --> 00:22:45.530 line:95%,end
I think because the team
went to a competition,

00:22:45.597 --> 00:22:48.033 line:95%,end
they had all these experiences,
they had some crazy fight

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:49.067 line:95%,end
with Cathy--

00:22:49.134 --> 00:22:51.403 line:95%,end
you know, life went on
without Christi and Chloe,

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:53.472 line:95%,end
and I don't think anybody
really even missed us.

00:22:53.538 --> 00:22:55.073 line:95%,end
Girls, listen up.

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:59.010 line:5%,start
If you want fame,
start paying right here, right now--

00:22:59.077 --> 00:23:03.515 line:5%,start
blood, sweat, sore muscles, callouses.

00:23:03.582 --> 00:23:06.818 line:95%,end
We went to a competition
and not one of my students

00:23:06.885 --> 00:23:08.320 line:95%,end
made the top 10?

00:23:08.387 --> 00:23:11.323 line:95%,end
That's never going to happen
to the Abby Lee Dance Company again.

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:13.792 line:95%,end
This is going to be like bootie camp.

00:23:13.859 --> 00:23:15.394 line:95%,end
You're going to walk in here
and you're going to work,

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:18.330 line:95%,end
and you're gonna work, and you're gonna
work even harder the next day.

00:23:18.397 --> 00:23:21.266 line:95%,end
The group is not where I want it to be.

00:23:21.333 --> 00:23:24.469 line:95%,end
I know it's been a long day,
but this number is nowhere

00:23:24.536 --> 00:23:25.937 line:95%,end
near competition-ready.

00:23:26.004 --> 00:23:27.773 line:95%,end
Lock the back knee in the lunge.

00:23:27.839 --> 00:23:30.075 line:95%,end
Oh, somebody's foot is flexed.

00:23:30.142 --> 00:23:32.644 line:95%,end
Whoa. What is she doing there? Get up.

00:23:32.711 --> 00:23:38.049 line:95%,end
Yo, blondie, you were gone
for a week, not a year.

00:23:38.116 --> 00:23:40.285 line:95%,end
If Abby doesn't come around
and at least give Chloe

00:23:40.352 --> 00:23:43.455 line:95%,end
the common respect of calling
her by her given name,

00:23:43.522 --> 00:23:45.257 line:95%,end
you know, I can't say that
I'm going to sit back

00:23:45.323 --> 00:23:46.758 line:95%,end
and just let it happen.

00:23:46.825 --> 00:23:48.026 line:95%,end
Moms, let's go.

00:23:48.093 --> 00:23:49.561 line:95%,end
Bring those costumes down.

00:23:49.628 --> 00:23:53.765 line:95%,end
Girls, we are leaving on
a plane tomorrow morning.

00:23:53.832 --> 00:23:56.001 line:95%,end
This is the third time we're changing it

00:23:56.067 --> 00:23:59.538 line:95%,end
because you couldn't do it
the first two times.

00:23:59.604 --> 00:24:02.107 line:95%,end
Blondie, we could all be home by now.

00:24:02.174 --> 00:24:05.243 line:95%,end
You know what?
My daughter has a name.

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:06.445 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: Not anymore in my book.

00:24:06.511 --> 00:24:08.213 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Oh, yes she does.

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.681 line:95%,end
She has a name, Abby.

00:24:09.748 --> 00:24:10.715 line:95%,end
So do you.

00:24:10.782 --> 00:24:11.750 line:95%,end
Starts with a B.


00:24:20.325 --> 00:24:22.060 line:5%,start
Come on, girls, let's go.

00:24:22.127 --> 00:24:24.596 line:95%,end
MELISSA: In10sity is a good
competition for us this week

00:24:24.663 --> 00:24:26.932 line:95%,end
because there's a lot of
intense feelings between Abby

00:24:26.998 --> 00:24:29.601 line:95%,end
and Christi, between Kelly and Christi.

00:24:29.668 --> 00:24:31.102 line:5%,start
So intense is the word this week.

00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:33.805 line:95%,end
Girls, remember, you are
in Fort Lauderdale.

00:24:33.872 --> 00:24:35.974 line:95%,end
I mean, these kids down here dance.

00:24:36.041 --> 00:24:39.811 line:95%,end
Dance is part of the culture,
so you need to really focus.

00:24:39.878 --> 00:24:41.446 line:95%,end
This is all about the technique.

00:24:42.147 --> 00:24:43.381 line:95%,end
You got it?

00:24:48.653 --> 00:24:50.222 line:95%,end
Whether I called one time or 10 times,

00:24:50.288 --> 00:24:51.990 line:95%,end
she should have called me back.

00:24:52.057 --> 00:24:53.658 line:95%,end
MELISSA: She never answers my calls, too.

00:24:53.725 --> 00:24:55.360 line:95%,end
I don't know what the problem is.

00:24:55.427 --> 00:24:57.195 line:95%,end
No. I don't think I did anything wrong.

00:24:57.262 --> 00:24:58.830 line:95%,end
I don't, either.

00:24:58.897 --> 00:25:00.932 line:95%,end
- Christi, you're awfully quiet.
- Where's that fire?

00:25:00.999 --> 00:25:03.068 line:95%,end
Where's that spunk?

00:25:03.134 --> 00:25:04.236 line:95%,end
All gone.

00:25:04.302 --> 00:25:05.670 line:95%,end
You're not a wallflower.

00:25:06.004 --> 00:25:07.839 line:95%,end
Maybe I turned over a new leaf.

00:25:09.841 --> 00:25:11.243 line:95%,end
Now, listen to me.

00:25:11.309 --> 00:25:14.145 line:95%,end
When you get out there,
it's your face that wins.

00:25:14.212 --> 00:25:16.815 line:95%,end
Everybody here has beautiful technique.

00:25:16.882 --> 00:25:19.150 line:95%,end
Nobody else has Maddie's face.

00:25:19.217 --> 00:25:20.919 line:95%,end
Girls, duet.

00:25:20.986 --> 00:25:22.721 line:95%,end
Paige, you don't need to be goofy.

00:25:22.787 --> 00:25:24.389 line:95%,end
It's fun. It's hot.

00:25:24.456 --> 00:25:25.757 line:95%,end
You should look beautiful.

00:25:25.824 --> 00:25:27.926 line:95%,end
You've got two weeks
to work on this routine.

00:25:27.993 --> 00:25:29.694 line:95%,end
They haven't really worked
on it for two weeks, Abby.

00:25:29.761 --> 00:25:32.230 line:95%,end
- They lied.
- I know, that's my point.

00:25:32.531 --> 00:25:35.033 line:95%,end
They don't self-motivate themselves.

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:37.335 line:95%,end
- They don't get out there and work on it.
- When do you want them to work on it?

00:25:37.402 --> 00:25:39.504 line:95%,end
We had privates
but we weren't able to go to those,

00:25:39.571 --> 00:25:41.239 line:95%,end
but Maddie went to hers.

00:25:41.306 --> 00:25:42.774 line:95%,end
You're so jealous of that kid, oh my god.

00:25:42.841 --> 00:25:43.975 line:95%,end
I'm not jealous of Maddie.

00:25:44.042 --> 00:25:45.710 line:95%,end
You're jealous
that I'm talking to her,

00:25:45.777 --> 00:25:47.345 line:95%,end
that I'm telling you the same thing
that I tell her every week.

00:25:47.412 --> 00:25:49.447 line:95%,end
Because, Abby, we're
going on a couple after her.

00:25:49.514 --> 00:25:51.349 line:95%,end
You made sure her makeup was perfect,

00:25:51.416 --> 00:25:52.617 line:95%,end
her costume was perfect.

00:25:52.684 --> 00:25:54.653 line:95%,end
You haven't looked at these two at all.

00:25:54.719 --> 00:25:55.854 line:95%,end
Well, you handle her makeup.

00:25:55.921 --> 00:25:56.922 line:95%,end
She's your job.

00:25:57.188 --> 00:25:59.658 line:95%,end
KELLY: Well, maybe Melissa
should learn how to do makeup.

00:25:59.724 --> 00:26:01.459 line:95%,end
This is Melissa's job, too.

00:26:01.526 --> 00:26:03.395 line:95%,end
Melissa has never walked
into my studio and said,

00:26:03.461 --> 00:26:05.697 line:95%,end
my children are my job. Never.

00:26:05.764 --> 00:26:07.332 line:95%,end
I don't need a job.

00:26:07.399 --> 00:26:09.935 line:95%,end
I know.
Your kids still needs to point her feet.

00:26:10.001 --> 00:26:12.003 line:95%,end
That's your job, to teach them.

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:14.539 line:95%,end
No. Money can't buy talent.

00:26:14.606 --> 00:26:17.275 line:5%,start
Kelly, you want Paige's duet pulled again,

00:26:17.342 --> 00:26:18.910 line:5%,start
two weeks in a row?

00:26:18.977 --> 00:26:21.479 line:95%,end
You want Brooke's solo to just disappear?

00:26:22.247 --> 00:26:23.782 line:95%,end
How about you ask Holly and Christi

00:26:23.848 --> 00:26:25.617 line:95%,end
what running their mouths got them?

00:26:25.684 --> 00:26:28.186 line:95%,end
[I suggest you shut up and sit down.

00:26:28.253 --> 00:26:30.221 line:95%,end
This is Brooke's first solo act.

00:26:30.488 --> 00:26:33.558 line:95%,end
We'll see if it's her
last solo on the team.

00:26:34.025 --> 00:26:37.162 line:95%,end
Girls, go out there and dance today

00:26:37.228 --> 00:26:39.264 line:95%,end
and don't make me sorry
that I let you do it.

00:26:39.564 --> 00:26:40.932 line:95%,end
Understand?

00:26:41.333 --> 00:26:42.634 line:5%,start
There is an elephant in the room,

00:26:42.701 --> 00:26:44.069 line:5%,start
and for once, it's not Abby.

00:26:44.636 --> 00:26:46.838 line:95%,end
Kelly and I have this huge feud going on,

00:26:46.905 --> 00:26:48.607 line:95%,end

to have to talk it out.

00:26:48.673 --> 00:26:49.841 line:95%,end
We can't keep going on like this.

00:26:51.142 --> 00:26:52.744 line:95%,end
I will talk to you as
soon as she's done dancing.

00:26:52.811 --> 00:26:55.614 line:95%,end
I want to get her out there
and then I'll talk to you, okay?

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.015 line:95%,end
Mm-hmm.

a preconceived notion.

But you know what? [interposing voices]

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:39.510 line:95%,end
So Christi, if you want
to talk, let's go outside.

00:39:39.577 --> 00:39:41.345 line:95%,end
If you don't want to talk,
we don't have to.

You're rolling your eyes.

00:39:42.613 --> 00:39:44.982 line:95%,end

I'm entitled to.

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:47.518 line:95%,end

You called me on Friday.

00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:53.724 line:95%,end
What else do you want me to do?
CHRISTI: No, you didn't.

00:39:53.791 --> 00:39:55.159 line:95%,end
KELLY: Yes, I did.

00:39:55.226 --> 00:39:56.227 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: And if I didn't answer,
you should have called again.

You were having a problem here.

00:39:58.195 --> 00:40:01.265 line:95%,end
I sat in a parking lot for you

And when you weren't here,
I was sticking up for you--

But you should have called me.

00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:08.472 line:95%,end
But you don't know it because you didn't
answer my phone call.

00:40:08.539 --> 00:40:09.940 line:95%,end
- CHRISTI: You didn't call me.
- I called you.

00:40:10.007 --> 00:40:11.675 line:95%,end
KELLY: No, I shouldn't have
had to call you, Christi.

00:40:11.742 --> 00:40:13.677 line:95%,end
- CHRISTI: Are you kidding me?
- I did nothing wrong.

00:40:13.744 --> 00:40:15.679 line:95%,end
I was having a really
bad week and a real friend

00:40:15.746 --> 00:40:17.047 line:95%,end
would've picked up a phone and called me.

00:40:17.114 --> 00:40:20.751 line:95%,end
But I'm wrong because I said
that you talk to Melissa

00:40:20.818 --> 00:40:21.986 line:95%,end
more than you talk to me.

00:40:22.052 --> 00:40:24.288 line:95%,end
- You hurt my feelings.
- I don't--

00:40:24.355 --> 00:40:26.957 line:95%,end
And you hurt mine.
I called you.

00:40:27.024 --> 00:40:30.060 line:95%,end
- What else do you want me to do?
- Get in your car and drive to my house.

00:40:30.127 --> 00:40:31.228 line:95%,end
No, I'm not driving to your house.

00:40:31.295 --> 00:40:32.296 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Why?
- I called you.

00:40:32.363 --> 00:40:34.198 line:95%,end
If you can't answer my phone
calls, then [bleep] you.

00:40:36.066 --> 00:40:38.536 line:95%,end

I wasn't here when she needed me.

but when it's from Maddie, she cries.

00:41:20.411 --> 00:41:22.713 line:5%,start
You would kill us in our sleep
if it meant your kids would get ahead.
