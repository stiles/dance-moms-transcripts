ABBY (VOICEOVER):
Previously on "Dance Moms"--

00:00:02.902 --> 00:00:04.637 line:5%,start
ABBY: Girls, this is for Nationals!

00:00:04.704 --> 00:00:07.674 line:5%,start
Candy Apple Dance Center
can't wait to beat your ass.

KELLY: I was talking about how
my daughter's come 3,000 miles

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:13.947 line:5%,start
to do three steps.

00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:15.982 line:5%,start
ABBY: And be lucky she's
doing those first steps.

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.051 line:5%,start
[crying] I don't know how
much people think I can take.

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:19.352 line:5%,start
I can't take it!

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:22.589 line:5%,start
ABBY: There should be blood
on that dance floor, blood on that stage.

00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:23.656 line:5%,start
[cheering]

00:00:23.723 --> 00:00:26.760 line:5%,start
And our top scoring
National winner with 138--

00:00:26.826 --> 00:00:29.629 line:5%,start
[cheering and applause]

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:32.165 line:5%,start
JILL: Good job, girls!

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:33.466 line:5%,start
It's hard to watch your kids on stage

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.735 line:5%,start
and think it's the last time you're
going to watch them dance.

00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:37.670 line:5%,start
I just don't want to come back.

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:41.007 line:5%,start
ABBY (VOICEOVER):
Coming up on "Dance Moms"--

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:44.511 line:5%,start
ABBY: I want you to be the first to know
that I'm going to hold an audition.

00:00:44.577 --> 00:00:45.745 line:5%,start
I'm replacing Brooke and Paige.

00:00:46.112 --> 00:00:47.113 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: Come hell or high water,

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.415 line:5%,start
I'm getting Kelly back here.

00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:50.650 line:5%,start
Can you tell me that I
have a brilliant idea?

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:52.185 line:5%,start
You have a brilliant idea.

00:00:52.252 --> 00:00:53.253 line:5%,start
[laughs]

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:56.356 line:5%,start
ABBY: Kendall is going to do a solo
this weekend.

00:00:56.423 --> 00:00:57.657 line:5%,start
[crying]
JILL: What's wrong?

00:00:57.724 --> 00:00:58.725 line:5%,start
HOLLY: What happened?

00:00:58.792 --> 00:01:00.460 line:5%,start
Abby kept yelling at me.

00:01:00.527 --> 00:01:02.662 line:5%,start
JILL: [yelling] You go back to LA
if that's what you want!

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:04.697 line:5%,start
Because we can't
compete with that here.

00:01:04.764 --> 00:01:07.233 line:5%,start
You cannot be a national title holder

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.269 line:5%,start
and run off the stage
because you forgot your dance.

00:01:09.335 --> 00:01:11.838 line:5%,start
There will be <i>none </i>of that this season.

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:15.008 line:5%,start
Year after year, her kid won a title.

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:17.477 line:5%,start
Now she [bleep] all over that title.

00:01:17.544 --> 00:01:18.645 line:5%,start
Hit the road, Jack.

00:01:18.711 --> 00:01:19.979 line:5%,start
There's always another kid.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.382 line:95%,end

THEME SONG: Get up.

00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:26.352 line:95%,end
Get on the floor.

00:01:26.953 --> 00:01:32.525 line:95%,end
My world is with my girls,
living on the dance floor.

00:01:33.226 --> 00:01:35.395 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:41.301 line:5%,start
- JILL: Hi, guys.
- HOLLY: How are you?

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:43.736 line:95%,end
- How are you?
- It's good to see you!

00:01:43.803 --> 00:01:45.538 line:95%,end
JILL: We're the first ones here.

00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:47.207 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: It's the first week back
after our long break,

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:49.542 line:95%,end
and I think all the girls are
really excited to be back.

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:52.045 line:5%,start
They came off such an amazing
win at Nationals,

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:53.713 line:5%,start
and I think they're excited to show Abby

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.948 line:5%,start
that they've improved.

00:01:55.014 --> 00:01:56.082 line:95%,end
Hi, sweetie.

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:57.150 line:95%,end
- How are you?
- Good.

00:01:57.217 --> 00:01:58.885 line:95%,end
We all showed up for dance today,

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:01.187 line:95%,end
and Kelly's not in the driveway.

00:02:01.254 --> 00:02:04.624 line:5%,start
It's...like our team is not whole.

00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:07.694 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:02:07.994 --> 00:02:09.662 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: You got to really experience
hip hop.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:10.797 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Look. Look at this.

00:02:10.864 --> 00:02:11.865 line:95%,end
Look at this part.

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:15.502 line:95%,end
[ominous music]

00:02:17.504 --> 00:02:18.505 line:95%,end
All right.

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:30.183 line:95%,end
I am not doing a pyramid right now.

00:02:31.117 --> 00:02:32.886 line:5%,start
How dare Kelly do this to me?

00:02:32.952 --> 00:02:34.420 line:5%,start
I've had it.

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:36.589 line:5%,start
There's not enough people to do a pyramid.

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:38.191 line:95%,end
I have to go back to the drawing board.

00:02:38.258 --> 00:02:39.259 line:95%,end
No pyramid.

00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:41.861 line:95%,end
I'm angry at the people that aren't here.

00:02:42.795 --> 00:02:44.531 line:95%,end
I'm very disappointed.

00:02:46.065 --> 00:02:48.234 line:95%,end
But I'm also angry at the people
that are here.

00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:50.537 line:95%,end
You had six group numbers.

00:02:50.603 --> 00:02:52.872 line:95%,end
Some of you know two of them,
some of you know one of them.

00:02:53.873 --> 00:02:56.176 line:95%,end
That's not going to be a winning number.

00:02:56.242 --> 00:02:58.778 line:95%,end
After Nationals, there was a break
in the competition season.

00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:01.781 line:95%,end
While I was gone shooting my show
in Los Angeles,

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:04.717 line:95%,end
I arranged for some guest choreographers
to come into my studio

00:03:04.784 --> 00:03:07.921 line:95%,end
to have routines that are already
ready to go.

00:03:08.454 --> 00:03:10.523 line:95%,end
But then I learned from my staff

00:03:11.124 --> 00:03:12.425 line:95%,end
that nobody showed up.

00:03:12.492 --> 00:03:15.395 line:95%,end
Last season you all had two solos
ready to go

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:18.998 line:95%,end
before we ever started
our competition season.

00:03:19.065 --> 00:03:21.901 line:95%,end
I didn't find out the people weren't here

00:03:21.968 --> 00:03:23.970 line:95%,end
until the choreographers
called me and say, hey,

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:26.239 line:95%,end
it was kind of hard to get
a great number together

00:03:26.306 --> 00:03:27.974 line:95%,end
when only two kids were there.

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:30.009 line:95%,end
That makes me look bad.

00:03:30.076 --> 00:03:32.011 line:95%,end
Do these kids really think that you

00:03:32.078 --> 00:03:37.517 line:95%,end
win an overall national title,
and then you don't take class anymore?

00:03:37.584 --> 00:03:38.985 line:95%,end
Really?

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:41.154 line:95%,end
You're only as good as
your last performance.

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:45.225 line:95%,end
The break is the time that you
set new goals, 

00:03:45.291 --> 00:03:48.428 line:95%,end
you overcome new obstacles,
and you improve.

00:03:55.568 --> 00:03:57.003 line:95%,end
No pyramid.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:02.809 line:95%,end
HOLLY: But, Abby, how can you throw away
all that they worked for last year?

00:04:02.875 --> 00:04:04.177 line:95%,end
Like this.

00:04:04.711 --> 00:04:08.481 line:95%,end
Girls, no pyramid.

00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:13.152 line:95%,end
This weekend we will be traveling
to Denver, Colorado

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:15.355 line:95%,end
to attend In10sity Dance.

00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:17.790 line:95%,end
I want you to be the first
to know that I'm

00:04:17.857 --> 00:04:20.660 line:95%,end
going to hold an audition,
and I'm replacing Brooke and Paige.

00:04:20.727 --> 00:04:23.129 line:95%,end
And you will be nice
and wonderful and kind

00:04:23.196 --> 00:04:24.597 line:95%,end
to whoever the two people are.

00:04:24.664 --> 00:04:26.165 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:04:26.232 --> 00:04:28.368 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Abby not only is screaming
at our kids


00:04:28.434 --> 00:04:31.037 line:95%,end
that they missed a few days of dance class

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:33.940 line:95%,end
for family vacation,
but it's also our fault that Kelly,

00:04:34.007 --> 00:04:35.441 line:95%,end
Brooke and Paige aren't here.

00:04:35.508 --> 00:04:38.711 line:95%,end
Maybe I ought to rip your pyramid down
and throw it in the dumpster.

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:40.413 line:95%,end
Because it won't fit in the trash can.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.481 line:95%,end
OK.

00:04:41.547 --> 00:04:45.184 line:95%,end
So every free minute that you
have over the next two weeks,

00:04:45.251 --> 00:04:46.919 line:95%,end
you'd better be working on these numbers.

00:04:46.986 --> 00:04:49.155 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: Chloe, put your hand down.

00:04:49.222 --> 00:04:50.156 line:95%,end
Oh, god.

00:04:50.223 --> 00:04:51.524 line:95%,end
Please put your hand down.

00:04:51.591 --> 00:04:53.159 line:95%,end
ABBY: Chloe, you were at the top
of the pyramid.

00:04:53.226 --> 00:04:55.328 line:95%,end
You were the national winner.

00:04:55.395 --> 00:04:56.729 line:95%,end
It's the first week out.

00:04:56.796 --> 00:04:58.064 line:95%,end
You should be doing a solo.

00:04:58.131 --> 00:04:59.565 line:95%,end
You should be defending that title.

00:04:59.632 --> 00:05:01.768 line:95%,end
But I don't know if I'm going
to even do solos.

00:05:01.834 --> 00:05:03.903 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Yeah. Way to go, Chlo.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.906 line:95%,end
Like, don't make eye contact,
raise your hand, and ask her questions.

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:08.841 line:95%,end
Like, try to find the back of pack.

00:05:08.908 --> 00:05:10.176 line:95%,end
Mackenzie's the only smart one.

00:05:10.243 --> 00:05:12.712 line:95%,end
She's like, I'm little
and I'm standing behind everyone.

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:14.580 line:95%,end
ABBY: Don't ask me about the solos, again.

00:05:14.647 --> 00:05:15.648 line:95%,end
I don't know what I'm doing.

00:05:15.715 --> 00:05:17.717 line:95%,end
Everybody's probably wondering
how I'm going

00:05:17.784 --> 00:05:19.952 line:95%,end
to assign routines this week.

00:05:20.019 --> 00:05:22.555 line:95%,end
My focus is going to be the group.

00:05:22.622 --> 00:05:25.224 line:95%,end
I need to get the group routine under way

00:05:25.291 --> 00:05:29.295 line:95%,end
before I give any thought
to who's doing a solo or duet or trio.

00:05:29.362 --> 00:05:30.997 line:95%,end
This is the group routine.

00:05:31.064 --> 00:05:34.767 line:95%,end
And you, and you and Paige were demons.

00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:38.438 line:95%,end
And you, and you and Brooke were angels.

00:05:38.504 --> 00:05:43.242 line:95%,end
So now, Chloe's the angel
and you're all demons.

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:46.512 line:95%,end
See how people not
showing up affected you?

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.218 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I love how Abby's like,
oh, she's not coming back, ever.

00:05:52.285 --> 00:05:53.286 line:95%,end
Oh, oh, oh.

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:56.789 line:95%,end
No one will treat me this way
in my studio and get away with it.

00:05:56.856 --> 00:05:58.091 line:95%,end
No. Kelly didn't show up.

00:05:58.157 --> 00:05:59.525 line:95%,end
You didn't kick her out.
[laughs]

00:05:59.592 --> 00:06:01.060 line:95%,end
Kelly is not going to crawl back.

00:06:01.127 --> 00:06:02.228 line:95%,end
- CHRISTI: No.
- No way.

00:06:02.295 --> 00:06:03.930 line:95%,end
- She's not going to do that.
- She said she's not.

00:06:03.996 --> 00:06:07.166 line:5%,start
I-- I really do believe she's not going
to come crawling back.

00:06:07.567 --> 00:06:12.438 line:5%,start
Five, six, seven, and piqu ,
through, look.

00:06:12.505 --> 00:06:14.140 line:95%,end
Down, down, up.

00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:15.208 line:95%,end
Pretty.

00:06:15.274 --> 00:06:19.479 line:95%,end
The group routine this
week is "Angel and Demons."

00:06:19.545 --> 00:06:23.483 line:95%,end
It's about an angel who's being
torn apart inside by the demons.

00:06:23.549 --> 00:06:24.951 line:95%,end
One-- watch your arms.

00:06:25.017 --> 00:06:26.319 line:95%,end
Watch your arms.

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:27.920 line:95%,end
She wants to let them out.

00:06:27.987 --> 00:06:30.690 line:95%,end
But, then again, she wants
to hide them from everyone.

00:06:30.757 --> 00:06:34.527 line:95%,end
Run, run, saut  through, run.

00:06:35.495 --> 00:06:37.463 line:95%,end
So you're coming too soon.

00:06:38.498 --> 00:06:39.832 line:95%,end
You're there before they get there.

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:42.301 line:95%,end
And you are forgetting what to do.

00:06:42.368 --> 00:06:44.637 line:95%,end
You're, like, blanking on me, you.

00:06:44.704 --> 00:06:46.773 line:95%,end
And you're not getting around her
fast enough.

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:49.041 line:95%,end
You should be around her
before she's out on the floor.

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:51.411 line:95%,end
Wait. Can I just say one more
thing about the pyramid?

00:06:51.477 --> 00:06:53.513 line:95%,end
My child is the only one here who's never

00:06:53.579 --> 00:06:55.481 line:95%,end
been at the top of the pyramid.
Do you guys realize that?

00:06:55.548 --> 00:06:56.649 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Oh, really?

00:06:56.716 --> 00:06:58.518 line:95%,end
So I know you don't give it any clout,

00:06:58.584 --> 00:07:03.589 line:95%,end
but I would really like for some day,
for her to have that goal.

00:07:03.656 --> 00:07:05.825 line:95%,end
And I really was hoping she
would say that.

00:07:05.892 --> 00:07:07.493 line:95%,end
Look, I want to get to the top
of that pyramid.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.561 line:95%,end
Because--
- No.

00:07:08.628 --> 00:07:09.629 line:95%,end
--they can.

00:07:09.695 --> 00:07:11.831 line:95%,end
My goal is to get Kendall
at the top of the pyramid.

00:07:11.898 --> 00:07:14.801 line:5%,start
And, according to Abby, it's not always

00:07:14.867 --> 00:07:18.171 line:5%,start
your placement in how you
do in a group, meaning you

00:07:18.237 --> 00:07:21.541 line:5%,start
don't always have to win to
be at the top of the pyramid.

00:07:21.607 --> 00:07:23.776 line:95%,end
I'm holding an open audition.

00:07:25.378 --> 00:07:26.746 line:95%,end
I'm going to look at every kid.

00:07:26.813 --> 00:07:29.849 line:95%,end
And you know that I don't
take kids from other studios

00:07:29.916 --> 00:07:31.517 line:95%,end
and just stick them out there.

00:07:31.584 --> 00:07:32.585 line:95%,end
That's ridiculous.

00:07:32.652 --> 00:07:35.154 line:95%,end
I want it to be somebody
from my own studio.

00:07:35.221 --> 00:07:36.155 line:95%,end
But, you know what?

00:07:36.222 --> 00:07:37.590 line:95%,end
I don't really care anymore.

00:07:38.257 --> 00:07:40.393 line:95%,end
I hope they're 10 times
better than Paige and Brooke.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.161 line:95%,end
Let's go.

00:07:42.228 --> 00:07:43.229 line:95%,end
Turn around.

00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:46.265 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:07:51.037 --> 00:07:53.539 line:95%,end
We started planning this audition
while I was still in LA.

00:07:53.606 --> 00:07:56.876 line:95%,end
There was a line around the
building and down the block.

00:07:56.943 --> 00:07:58.611 line:95%,end
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

00:07:58.678 --> 00:08:01.714 line:95%,end
- Hi.
- Hi!

00:08:02.114 --> 00:08:03.516 line:95%,end
ABBY: All right.

00:08:03.583 --> 00:08:05.918 line:95%,end
Anybody from Michigan?

00:08:05.985 --> 00:08:06.752 line:95%,end
Ohio?

00:08:06.819 --> 00:08:08.454 line:95%,end
New Orleans?

00:08:09.655 --> 00:08:12.892 line:95%,end
JILL: There's always that fear
in the back of your mind

00:08:12.959 --> 00:08:15.761 line:95%,end
that-- what if she finds
someone that she thinks

00:08:15.828 --> 00:08:20.099 line:95%,end
is better, cuter, more talented
than any one of our kids?

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:22.735 line:95%,end
I mean, I would hate for
Kendall to be replaced.

00:08:22.802 --> 00:08:27.406 line:95%,end
Who would like to be on this particular
team at the Abby Lee Dance Company?

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.142 line:95%,end
OK.
I have two spots.

00:08:30.209 --> 00:08:31.744 line:95%,end
All right, let's do it.

00:08:31.811 --> 00:08:33.980 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:08:35.214 --> 00:08:36.382 line:95%,end
All right, girls, up.

00:08:36.449 --> 00:08:38.117 line:95%,end
You guys right there, go.

00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:43.222 line:95%,end
The talent in the studio
right now is blowing me away, wow.

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:49.195 line:95%,end
I have never seen this many talented kids
all in one place together at one time.

00:08:49.262 --> 00:08:50.930 line:95%,end
Oh, maybe we have Brooke!

00:08:50.997 --> 00:08:51.964 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:08:52.031 --> 00:08:53.799 line:95%,end
I think-- I think we found Brooke.


00:08:57.436 --> 00:08:58.871 line:5%,start
Ready? Let's do it.

00:09:01.073 --> 00:09:02.208 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:09:02.275 --> 00:09:04.710 line:95%,end
OK. I'm going to keep you, you--

00:09:04.777 --> 00:09:07.647 line:95%,end
of course I'm looking for somebody
that fits in with the group.

00:09:07.713 --> 00:09:11.817 line:5%,start
But I'm also looking for
beautiful legs, gorgeous feet,

00:09:11.884 --> 00:09:14.120 line:5%,start
excellent flexibility,

00:09:14.186 --> 00:09:17.924 line:5%,start
and a great ability to comprehend quickly.

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:22.461 line:5%,start
That is key when you have to do a
new competition routine every single week.

00:09:22.528 --> 00:09:24.497 line:5%,start
I'm going to let you go.
Where are you from?

00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:26.165 line:5%,start
You're gone.
You jump in there with them.

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:28.701 line:95%,end
JILL: It's kind of interesting
sitting in the viewing room,

00:09:28.768 --> 00:09:30.336 line:95%,end
watching these moms.

00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:35.675 line:95%,end
It's almost like the moms were competing
as well as their kids.

00:09:35.741 --> 00:09:37.176 line:95%,end
These moms are crazy.

00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:38.144 line:95%,end
Hey, Leslie?

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:39.211 line:95%,end
Yes?

00:09:39.278 --> 00:09:41.013 line:5%,start
WOMAN: I did have something
I wanted to ask you about.

00:09:45.384 --> 00:09:46.385 line:5%,start
MELISSA: OK. I'm sorry.

00:09:46.452 --> 00:09:47.486 line:95%,end
I have to get through.
- Because I felt like it.

00:09:47.553 --> 00:09:48.654 line:95%,end
I don't have to answer to you.

00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:50.690 line:95%,end
You are the rudest woman I know.

00:09:50.756 --> 00:09:51.891 line:95%,end
Yes, you are.
- Am I really?

00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.292 line:95%,end
Nobody even asked
me to pick them up.

00:09:53.359 --> 00:09:54.560 line:95%,end
Are you kidding me?
You were chaperoning.

00:09:54.627 --> 00:09:56.028 line:95%,end
LESLIE: They just
assumed-- you're a nobody.

00:09:56.095 --> 00:09:57.063 line:95%,end
Why are you even here?

00:09:57.129 --> 00:09:59.765 line:95%,end
I do not abandon eight kids in LA.

00:09:59.832 --> 00:10:00.833 line:95%,end
[angry chatter]

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:01.834 line:95%,end
LESLIE: Shut up!

00:10:01.901 --> 00:10:03.302 line:95%,end
Go back and drive
your [inaudible] bus.

You're just looking better all
the time over there, purple.

Next group!

00:10:14.847 --> 00:10:17.850 line:95%,end
HOLLY: There's enough talent
during this open call

00:10:17.917 --> 00:10:21.320 line:95%,end
that Abby could easily
make another team or two.

00:10:21.387 --> 00:10:22.188 line:95%,end
I see it.

00:10:22.254 --> 00:10:23.689 line:95%,end
I'm sure the other moms see it.

00:10:23.756 --> 00:10:26.826 line:5%,start
I think everyone's feeling
a little pressured, like, hmm.

00:10:26.892 --> 00:10:30.229 line:5%,start
Is Abby getting bright ideas
and maybe replace all the girls?

00:10:30.763 --> 00:10:31.964 line:95%,end
Congratulations!

00:10:32.031 --> 00:10:34.066 line:95%,end
These are our finalists.
Give them a round of applause.

00:10:34.133 --> 00:10:35.134 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:10:35.201 --> 00:10:37.169 line:95%,end
MELISSA: My biggest concern
about Abby bringing someone new

00:10:37.236 --> 00:10:40.406 line:95%,end
into the team is, you know,
these girls are all tall.

00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:43.209 line:95%,end
They're at least six,
eight inches taller than our girls.

00:10:43.275 --> 00:10:45.711 line:5%,start
So it's kind of going to
look odd as a group number.

00:10:45.778 --> 00:10:47.546 line:5%,start
So this girl is going
to have to be featured

00:10:47.613 --> 00:10:48.848 line:5%,start
in every single dance.

00:10:49.715 --> 00:10:50.783 line:95%,end
ABBY: Congratulations.

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:52.885 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:10:53.285 --> 00:10:55.521 line:95%,end
I'm-- I'm a little overwhelmed.

00:10:55.588 --> 00:10:57.056 line:95%,end
I have a lot to think about.

00:10:57.123 --> 00:11:01.794 line:95%,end
I will have to decide who will
be here in rehearsal tomorrow

00:11:01.861 --> 00:11:05.631 line:95%,end
and going to Denver, Colorado this weekend
to compete with our groups.

00:11:05.698 --> 00:11:06.999 line:95%,end
But, you never know.

00:11:07.066 --> 00:11:08.801 line:95%,end
There's some kids on thin ice.

00:11:08.868 --> 00:11:10.770 line:95%,end
It's not over tonight.

you wanted to do about dance?

No, not really.

00:11:25.384 --> 00:11:28.120 line:5%,start
BROOKE: My mom pulled me
and Paige out of dance

00:11:28.187 --> 00:11:32.625 line:5%,start
because Abby's really mean to my sister.

00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:36.295 line:95%,end
And she also doesn't
get along with my mom.

00:11:36.362 --> 00:11:37.630 line:95%,end
We need to decide what we want to do.

00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:39.598 line:95%,end
I don't even know if I want to dance.

00:11:39.665 --> 00:11:41.634 line:95%,end
OK, but what do you want to do?

00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:42.768 line:95%,end
Tell me what you want to do.

00:11:42.835 --> 00:11:46.038 line:95%,end
I want to do dancing,
but I also want to, like, model.

00:11:46.105 --> 00:11:48.374 line:95%,end
I would have never been able
to take you to do that modeling

00:11:48.441 --> 00:11:50.643 line:95%,end
if we weren't already in LA for dance.

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:53.345 line:95%,end
And that's why you got to do the song.

Like, it all goes together.

00:11:55.648 --> 00:11:58.417 line:95%,end
I think the real question is,
do you want to go back?

00:11:58.484 --> 00:12:00.152 line:95%,end
PAIGE: [laughs]
- No. I don't want to go back.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:04.090 line:5%,start
I-- I'm just done with Abby
torturing me and my kids.

00:12:04.156 --> 00:12:06.058 line:95%,end
I mean, this is supposed to be fun.

00:12:06.125 --> 00:12:09.595 line:95%,end
And I think my kids were starting
to not enjoy being there.

00:12:09.662 --> 00:12:12.665 line:95%,end
And I just-- I'm not going
to put my kids in an environment

00:12:12.732 --> 00:12:14.867 line:95%,end
that I don't think is safe
and healthy for them.

--that you and I have a good season--

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:32.551 line:95%,end
We can have a good season.

--and that you have learned
by stepping back and watching.

00:12:35.921 --> 00:12:38.023 line:95%,end
I think after seeing some of
those kids that auditioned--

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:39.725 line:95%,end
JILL: I know.

Abby gives Kendall the very
first solo of the season.

And I said to her, it's like
the first gift of Christmas.

Hey. Kendall has a solo!

00:12:52.138 --> 00:12:53.339 line:95%,end

All right.

00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:02.348 line:95%,end
I worked on some music
and I gave some thought

00:13:02.414 --> 00:13:07.153 line:95%,end
to who was here and who did what they
were supposed to do.

00:13:07.219 --> 00:13:11.791 line:95%,end
And I am going to start
a solo with Kendall.


00:13:11.857 --> 00:13:13.192 line:95%,end
It's called "It Girl."

00:13:13.259 --> 00:13:16.061 line:95%,end
You need to get yourself ready.
That's what I'm going to start with.

00:13:16.128 --> 00:13:18.230 line:95%,end
I want everyone else working
on the group routine.

of the talent,

00:13:20.466 --> 00:13:21.433 line:95%,end
and who did you pick?

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:22.601 line:95%,end
I'm not telling. I don't--

00:13:22.668 --> 00:13:24.203 line:95%,end
So you did choose one or two?

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:26.272 line:95%,end

to the dance studio.

Why do we have this need to
fill Paige and Brooke's spot?

Work with what you've got and--

00:13:42.888 --> 00:13:44.056 line:95%,end
Work with what you got.

for-- for 39 weeks, now.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:50.629 line:95%,end
It would've been easier to cast

the new person--

Yes.

JILL: And would this new
person start out on probation,

00:14:05.511 --> 00:14:06.812 line:95%,end

ABBY: I don't understand why the
mothers don't understand this.

looking any less

National Championship.

This is called "It Girl."

The music is a little bit different.

00:14:26.165 --> 00:14:29.134 line:5%,start
So it's sassy and it's fast and it's fun.

The music talks about a sassy, swanky,

00:14:32.371 --> 00:14:37.009 line:95%,end

somebody who's ahead of her time.

00:14:37.076 --> 00:14:38.110 line:95%,end

You know what?

This is Kendall's year to get something.

What did I tell you 10 times?

00:14:49.154 --> 00:14:51.090 line:95%,end
Don't step in front of yourself.

00:14:51.156 --> 00:14:52.725 line:95%,end
You can see how pigeon toed you are.

00:14:52.791 --> 00:14:54.159 line:95%,end
Step to the left.

00:14:54.226 --> 00:14:56.328 line:95%,end
I feel like I'm dealing with a 5-year-old.

Why are you not continuing
to turn and roll to the floor

00:14:59.231 --> 00:15:00.232 line:95%,end

00:15:00.299 --> 00:15:02.101 line:95%,end
It's the same thing. Do it.

00:15:02.668 --> 00:15:03.736 line:95%,end

from my faculty

00:15:05.838 --> 00:15:08.707 line:95%,end

hearing about Kendall.

is going to be a force to be

reckoned with this season.

00:15:17.016 --> 00:15:18.617 line:95%,end

Really, Kendall?

Kendall, you know what?
You're done.

00:15:25.357 --> 00:15:27.026 line:95%,end
The people that were in her dancing

00:15:27.092 --> 00:15:29.328 line:95%,end
are 1,000 times better than you.

00:15:29.395 --> 00:15:30.729 line:95%,end
Go somewhere else and work on it.

00:15:30.796 --> 00:15:32.698 line:95%,end
JILL: There's nothing like working
with Abby.

00:15:32.765 --> 00:15:36.302 line:95%,end
You almost have to get
your heart and your mind

in a certain mode to be
able to work with Abby.

00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:41.140 line:95%,end
Oh, she's crying.
Uh-oh.

JILL: What were you--
what were you working on?

She told me to do the turn, and I didn't
hear her, and she yelled at me.

Jill, I don't know what's going on but--

00:15:56.288 --> 00:15:57.690 line:95%,end
I don't, either.

--I have an empty room and I have 30 kids
shoved into studio B, practicing.

couldn't remember it two seconds later.

That's not Kendall.

00:16:13.739 --> 00:16:14.606 line:95%,end
Let's go.

00:16:14.673 --> 00:16:15.708 line:95%,end
That's what I mean.

00:16:15.774 --> 00:16:17.242 line:95%,end
She keeps being mean to me.

00:16:17.309 --> 00:16:20.846 line:95%,end
A kid who was the only one that got a solo
shouldn't be up there crying.

00:16:20.913 --> 00:16:22.614 line:95%,end
She's right.
You shouldn't be crying.

00:16:22.681 --> 00:16:24.883 line:95%,end
However, you are.

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:26.418 line:95%,end
ABBY: I have this crying kid.

00:16:26.986 --> 00:16:30.856 line:95%,end
She's nine years old

00:16:33.258 --> 00:16:34.727 line:95%,end
What is going on with your kid?

00:16:34.793 --> 00:16:36.061 line:95%,end
JILL: I don't know, Abby,
but you can't say that to her.

00:16:36.128 --> 00:16:37.296 line:95%,end
ABBY: Wait a minute.

00:16:37.363 --> 00:16:39.231 line:95%,end
I can say whatever I want, number one.

00:16:39.298 --> 00:16:42.167 line:95%,end
JILL: Well, then you can't
expect her to perform for you.

00:16:42.234 --> 00:16:43.902 line:95%,end
ABBY: The triple coup that she used to do,

00:16:43.969 --> 00:16:45.904 line:95%,end
that we worked on,
to the developp,

00:16:45.971 --> 00:16:48.307 line:95%,end
to the inside arabesque--
she couldn't do it.

00:16:48.374 --> 00:16:49.975 line:95%,end
She couldn't remember
what she just did.

00:16:50.042 --> 00:16:52.745 line:95%,end
Then she goes upstairs
and is crying like a baby.

00:16:52.811 --> 00:16:54.947 line:95%,end
JILL: Of course she's crying
because she told me

00:16:55.014 --> 00:16:56.715 line:95%,end
how her feelings were hurt.

00:16:56.782 --> 00:16:57.816 line:95%,end
Oh, you know what?

00:16:57.883 --> 00:16:58.851 line:95%,end
I gave it to her.

00:16:58.917 --> 00:17:00.119 line:95%,end
She had the time.
- All right.

00:17:00.185 --> 00:17:00.919 line:95%,end
That was it.

00:17:00.986 --> 00:17:01.720 line:95%,end
All right.

00:17:01.787 --> 00:17:02.821 line:95%,end
I can't-- you know what?

00:17:02.888 --> 00:17:03.922 line:95%,end
We can't compete!

JILL: I'm pissed off at Abby
because Kendall still

has all that fire in her
belly and all that potential,

00:17:09.695 --> 00:17:11.730 line:95%,end
and I need Abby to see that again.

00:17:11.797 --> 00:17:14.133 line:95%,end
My goal is to get Kendall
at the top of the pyramid.

00:17:14.199 --> 00:17:15.801 line:95%,end
And I want Kendall to be a star.

00:17:15.868 --> 00:17:18.303 line:95%,end
We can't compete with that, here!

It's not just a regular old Abby.

egotistical Abby.

How can that be?

Here's the--
here's the problem.

It's the inflated, egotistical,
I can have any kid out there I want--

00:17:52.071 --> 00:17:53.505 line:95%,end

Hi. How are you?

Does anybody have a nail file?

Should we get our cat claws ready?

00:18:13.325 --> 00:18:18.897 line:95%,end
If I go with you, I have a 10-year-old
to keep my age down.

00:18:19.131 --> 00:18:22.868 line:95%,end
If I go with you, then I can
win in the 13 to 15 division.

00:18:23.235 --> 00:18:25.537 line:5%,start
I called back two dancers
from the audition--

00:18:25.604 --> 00:18:26.705 line:5%,start
Ally and Ava.

00:18:26.772 --> 00:18:30.642 line:5%,start
Originally, I was replacing
Brooke and Paige.

00:18:30.709 --> 00:18:35.314 line:95%,end
But after closer consideration,
I decided just to go with one dancer.

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:38.884 line:95%,end
Pass and just double out.

00:18:38.951 --> 00:18:40.119 line:95%,end
I like Ava.

00:18:40.185 --> 00:18:42.020 line:95%,end
I think she's a really pretty little girl,

00:18:42.087 --> 00:18:45.424 line:95%,end
and I think she's fabulous
for only being 10 years old.

00:18:45.491 --> 00:18:47.926 line:95%,end
But she doesn't have her said ariel, yet.

00:18:47.993 --> 00:18:51.263 line:95%,end
I need a kid that can tumble
as well as dance.

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:52.331 line:95%,end
OK.

00:18:52.397 --> 00:18:53.932 line:95%,end
Whatever happens today,

I don't want you to take it as the gospel.

00:18:56.935 --> 00:18:59.438 line:95%,end
Two weeks could go by
and we could call somebody back in.

00:18:59.505 --> 00:19:01.306 line:95%,end
- Right.
- OK?

00:19:01.373 --> 00:19:03.175 line:95%,end
And, by then,
you may have your side ariel.

00:19:03.242 --> 00:19:04.243 line:95%,end
Yes?

00:19:04.309 --> 00:19:06.445 line:95%,end
So I'm going to tell you that today
is not your day.

00:19:06.512 --> 00:19:07.946 line:95%,end
- OK.
- All right?

00:19:08.013 --> 00:19:09.748 line:95%,end
And you're going to go to Denver with us.

00:19:09.815 --> 00:19:10.949 line:95%,end
All right?

This is a big opportunity.

She is gorgeous to look at.

Another competition season, huh?

Since Nationals in LA,
where we encountered Abby Lee,

my special teams kind of blew up.

Justice isn't coming back.

00:20:21.353 --> 00:20:25.123 line:95%,end
would you be OK if you
weren't on the team for now?

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:26.425 line:95%,end
I mean, you know--

00:20:26.491 --> 00:20:27.492 line:95%,end
Yeah.

00:20:27.559 --> 00:20:33.065 line:95%,end
Do you think that it would be
a good idea if I used all boys?

00:20:33.131 --> 00:20:35.434 line:95%,end
Oh, no.
You have chocolate on your teeth.

00:20:36.335 --> 00:20:38.437 line:95%,end
Ew.
Ew.

00:20:38.503 --> 00:20:39.504 line:95%,end
Let me see.

00:20:39.571 --> 00:20:41.173 line:95%,end
Open up.

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:42.841 line:95%,end
OK, it's gone.

00:20:42.908 --> 00:20:44.610 line:95%,end
Now it's underneath my fingernail.

00:20:44.676 --> 00:20:47.613 line:95%,end
I think an all-boy team will win a lot.

00:20:47.679 --> 00:20:48.714 line:95%,end
Would win a lot?

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:50.115 line:95%,end
Yeah, I think you're right, honey.

00:20:50.182 --> 00:20:52.451 line:95%,end
I think that mommy's idea is brilliant.

00:20:52.517 --> 00:20:54.386 line:95%,end
Can you tell me that I
have a brilliant idea?

00:20:54.453 --> 00:20:55.887 line:95%,end
You know how I love to
hear that kind of stuff.

00:20:55.954 --> 00:20:57.189 line:95%,end
You have a brilliant idea.

00:20:57.256 --> 00:20:58.557 line:95%,end
[laughs]

00:21:00.626 --> 00:21:02.461 line:5%,start
ABBY: We're going to start working
right now.

00:21:02.527 --> 00:21:04.296 line:5%,start
This is the group number.
- OK.

00:21:04.363 --> 00:21:06.298 line:5%,start
And I'm just tipping you off.

00:21:06.365 --> 00:21:08.400 line:95%,end
Chloe was my lead in the group number

00:21:08.467 --> 00:21:09.701 line:95%,end
and now it's going to be you.

00:21:09.768 --> 00:21:10.769 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:21:10.836 --> 00:21:12.904 line:95%,end
So I'm sure Chloe's mother's
going to hate you but,

00:21:12.971 --> 00:21:14.473 line:95%,end
oh, well.

00:21:14.539 --> 00:21:18.043 line:5%,start
SHELLY: It was overwhelming
because it was-- it was all so new.

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:19.344 line:5%,start
And, you know, of
course, there's always

00:21:19.411 --> 00:21:21.546 line:5%,start
anxiety when you haven't
danced with a team before,

00:21:21.613 --> 00:21:23.982 line:5%,start
especially a team that
was so seasoned and--

00:21:24.049 --> 00:21:26.151 line:5%,start
and had been together so long.

00:21:26.218 --> 00:21:28.720 line:95%,end
So we're going to start you over here.

00:21:28.787 --> 00:21:31.890 line:95%,end
Originally, Chloe had the lead
as the angel.

00:21:31.957 --> 00:21:35.494 line:95%,end
But now, Chloe is not the
tallest member of the group.

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:38.263 line:95%,end
So I'm going with the tall
member, and that's Ally.

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:40.565 line:95%,end
This was Brooke's and it's so little.

00:21:40.632 --> 00:21:43.168 line:95%,end
I want to see if it fits
you or if it looks stupid.

00:21:44.636 --> 00:21:45.370 line:95%,end
That's cute.

00:21:45.437 --> 00:21:46.705 line:95%,end
Turn back around.

00:21:46.772 --> 00:21:50.309 line:95%,end
ALLY: I felt really bad because Abby
switched me out with Chloe's part.


00:21:50.375 --> 00:21:52.010 line:95%,end
Because I didn't want to
just come in and, like,

00:21:52.077 --> 00:21:55.514 line:95%,end
take her spot because she's
been here for a long time.

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:56.381 line:95%,end
Who are you?

00:21:56.448 --> 00:21:57.382 line:95%,end
I am Ally's mom.

00:21:57.449 --> 00:21:58.450 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Oh, I'm like--

00:21:58.517 --> 00:21:59.518 line:95%,end
no one introduced us.
HOLLY: Hi.

00:21:59.584 --> 00:22:00.519 line:95%,end
- Here's Holly.
- Holly.

00:22:00.585 --> 00:22:01.520 line:95%,end
Nice to meet you.
- Shelly.

00:22:01.586 --> 00:22:02.721 line:95%,end
Nice to meet you.
HOLLY: Shelly?

00:22:02.788 --> 00:22:03.422 line:95%,end
Yes, Shelly.
HOLLY: Oh, nice to meet you.

00:22:03.488 --> 00:22:03.922 line:95%,end
And that is Ally.

00:22:03.989 --> 00:22:05.791 line:95%,end
Oh, OK.

00:22:05.857 --> 00:22:07.426 line:95%,end
What is she working on?

00:22:07.492 --> 00:22:08.460 line:95%,end
I-- I really don't--

00:22:08.527 --> 00:22:09.728 line:95%,end
I really don't know.

00:22:09.795 --> 00:22:12.864 line:95%,end
One, two, three, four.

00:22:12.931 --> 00:22:13.932 line:95%,end
Smile, one--

00:22:13.999 --> 00:22:16.268 line:95%,end
Looks like she's
learning a solo.

00:22:16.335 --> 00:22:17.436 line:95%,end
I don't know.

00:22:17.502 --> 00:22:19.404 line:95%,end
Break into a big lunge down.

00:22:19.471 --> 00:22:21.907 line:95%,end
I don't know if this is so much a solo--

00:22:21.973 --> 00:22:23.842 line:95%,end
Oh, so it's a private?

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:26.311 line:95%,end
HOLLY: I don't think it's a private.

00:22:26.378 --> 00:22:29.448 line:95%,end
It looks like Chloe's part of the dance.

00:22:29.514 --> 00:22:30.982 line:95%,end
OK.

00:22:31.049 --> 00:22:33.785 line:5%,start
HOLLY: As Ally's executing
the dance movements,

00:22:33.852 --> 00:22:37.289 line:5%,start
it becomes really apparent
that she is not a demon.

00:22:37.356 --> 00:22:40.459 line:95%,end
She is an angel
because she's doing Chloe's part.

00:22:40.525 --> 00:22:41.626 line:95%,end
It's the featured part.

00:22:41.693 --> 00:22:43.128 line:95%,end
It's the part in the group dance.

00:22:43.195 --> 00:22:44.863 line:95%,end
Oh, my god.
Christi's going to freak.

00:22:45.864 --> 00:22:48.233 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Because Chloe's been
talking non-stop about--

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:49.534 line:95%,end
She's happy.

00:22:49.601 --> 00:22:51.303 line:95%,end
And she said to Miss Abby
yesterday-- remember?

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:53.171 line:95%,end
She goes, am I still
going to have my part?

00:22:53.238 --> 00:22:54.506 line:95%,end
That's exactly right.

00:22:54.573 --> 00:22:55.674 line:95%,end
She did.

00:22:55.741 --> 00:22:57.008 line:95%,end
Excuse me just one minute.

00:22:57.075 --> 00:22:58.443 line:95%,end
HOLLY: OK.

00:22:59.544 --> 00:23:03.281 line:95%,end
Abby's not that noble to pick
Ally because I think she--

00:23:03.348 --> 00:23:06.451 line:95%,end
she believes Ally is that
superior of a-- of a dancer.

00:23:06.518 --> 00:23:09.988 line:95%,end
I think Abby selects Ally to do
that part because she's getting

00:23:10.055 --> 00:23:14.326 line:95%,end
back at Chloe for missing part
of her beauty camp during break.

00:23:14.393 --> 00:23:15.627 line:95%,end
- Hi, Jilly!
- Hi!

00:23:15.694 --> 00:23:16.628 line:95%,end
Ugh.

00:23:16.695 --> 00:23:18.163 line:95%,end
JILL: What?

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:19.664 line:95%,end
MELISSA: This is the new girl's mom.

00:23:19.731 --> 00:23:21.099 line:95%,end
Let's not tell her what, and let's just

00:23:21.166 --> 00:23:22.667 line:95%,end
see if she figures it out.
JILL: What?

00:23:22.734 --> 00:23:24.636 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:23:24.703 --> 00:23:25.871 line:95%,end
Oh, she's learning the group.

00:23:25.937 --> 00:23:29.107 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Uh-huh, but-- yup,
and now keep watching, though.

00:23:29.174 --> 00:23:30.242 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Keep watching.

00:23:30.308 --> 00:23:31.543 line:95%,end
She's doing Chloe's part, isn't she?

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:32.544 line:95%,end
There you go.

00:23:32.611 --> 00:23:34.112 line:95%,end
That's it.

00:23:34.179 --> 00:23:35.447 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:23:35.514 --> 00:23:38.183 line:95%,end
JILL: I think Christi
is going to be so disappointed.

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:42.187 line:5%,start
I feel that this was Abby's way
of teaching Chloe a lesson.

00:23:42.254 --> 00:23:44.689 line:5%,start
Don't stay away from the studio
for three months.

00:23:44.756 --> 00:23:47.392 line:95%,end
Don't go on family vacations, nonstop.

00:23:47.459 --> 00:23:48.860 line:95%,end
And-- and come to class.

00:23:48.927 --> 00:23:49.795 line:95%,end

00:23:49.861 --> 00:23:51.129 line:95%,end

00:23:51.196 --> 00:23:54.199 line:95%,end
Piqu , coup , piqu , coup , soutenu.

00:23:54.266 --> 00:23:56.134 line:95%,end
- Hello!
- Hey!

00:23:56.201 --> 00:23:57.202 line:95%,end
How are you?
Over there.

00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:58.270 line:95%,end
Over here.

00:23:58.336 --> 00:23:59.871 line:95%,end
We're just going to slide--
new girl was in my spot.

00:23:59.938 --> 00:24:01.072 line:95%,end
- Oh, is she here?
- MELISSA: Just slide her down.

00:24:01.139 --> 00:24:01.907 line:95%,end
- CHRISTI: The mom?
- JILL: Just slide down.

00:24:01.973 --> 00:24:03.375 line:95%,end
- Yeah.
- ABBY: Down.

00:24:03.442 --> 00:24:04.876 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Oh, does she have the solo?

00:24:04.943 --> 00:24:06.912 line:95%,end
MELISSA: No, not so much.

00:24:06.978 --> 00:24:07.712 line:95%,end
The new girl?

00:24:07.779 --> 00:24:08.780 line:95%,end
No.

00:24:08.847 --> 00:24:10.215 line:95%,end
It's the group dance she's learning.

00:24:10.282 --> 00:24:11.650 line:95%,end
Why is she doing Chloe's part?

00:24:11.716 --> 00:24:12.884 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Uh-huh.

00:24:12.951 --> 00:24:14.553 line:5%,start
Chloe's your national title winner

00:24:14.619 --> 00:24:16.588 line:5%,start
and she's been here since she was two.

00:24:16.655 --> 00:24:18.423 line:95%,end
You know, you talk about
these girls missing

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:21.560 line:95%,end
three days for vacation--
well, Ally's missed 13 years.

00:24:23.228 --> 00:24:24.196 line:95%,end
Hi.

00:24:24.296 --> 00:24:25.597 line:95%,end
JILL: Hi.
HOLLY: Hi.

00:24:25.664 --> 00:24:26.865 line:95%,end
- How are you?
- We meet again.

00:24:27.132 --> 00:24:28.533 line:95%,end
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:31.570 line:95%,end
SHELLY: I had the opportunity
to meet the moms.

00:24:31.636 --> 00:24:36.007 line:5%,start
And, you know, it was--
it was, you know, scary at first

00:24:36.074 --> 00:24:37.108 line:5%,start
because I'm not from here.

00:24:37.175 --> 00:24:38.577 line:95%,end
I'm not from Pittsburgh.

00:24:38.643 --> 00:24:40.412 line:95%,end
I'm-- I'm from New Orleans.

00:24:40.479 --> 00:24:42.247 line:95%,end
I-- I really don't know anyone.

00:24:42.314 --> 00:24:43.515 line:95%,end
So it was a little--

00:24:43.582 --> 00:24:45.283 line:95%,end
I was-- I was timid, at first.

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:47.419 line:95%,end
JILL: I have to say I don't approve.

00:24:47.486 --> 00:24:50.589 line:95%,end
Nothing against-- and I know
there's nothing you can do.

00:24:50.655 --> 00:24:52.257 line:95%,end
We-- we all do what we're told.

00:24:52.324 --> 00:24:54.860 line:95%,end
But, you know, Chlo worked hard.

00:24:54.926 --> 00:24:56.428 line:95%,end
They all worked hard.

00:24:56.495 --> 00:24:59.431 line:95%,end
And they've danced here their whole lives.

00:24:59.498 --> 00:25:00.432 line:95%,end
Yeah.

00:25:00.499 --> 00:25:02.133 line:95%,end
I-- I mean, I--

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.535 line:95%,end
I can understand that.

00:25:03.602 --> 00:25:05.203 line:95%,end
It's understandable.

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:06.605 line:95%,end
I'm sorry.

00:25:06.671 --> 00:25:07.672 line:95%,end
You know what, Shelly?

00:25:07.739 --> 00:25:09.040 line:95%,end
If you feel so bad, why don't you

00:25:09.107 --> 00:25:10.442 line:95%,end
put your money where your mouth is

00:25:10.509 --> 00:25:12.043 line:95%,end
and go down and say something to Abby?

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:14.312 line:95%,end
Like, you know, it's not right
to take the lead away

00:25:14.379 --> 00:25:16.815 line:95%,end
from a child who's been
here since she was two.

00:25:18.149 --> 00:25:22.287 line:95%,end
ABBY: Chloe, the name of your music
is "Nobody's Perfect."

00:25:22.354 --> 00:25:25.123 line:95%,end
And that means even though
you won that national title,

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:27.058 line:95%,end
I didn't think your
performance was perfect.

00:25:27.125 --> 00:25:29.728 line:95%,end
You need to work on bringing
that back like straighter.

00:25:29.794 --> 00:25:31.463 line:95%,end
Don't bend it and pull it through.

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:34.933 line:95%,end
You need to be just as good as you
were then.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.434 line:95%,end
Chloe should have a solo, of course.

00:25:36.501 --> 00:25:39.638 line:95%,end
She is the reigning National Champion.

00:25:39.704 --> 00:25:41.773 line:95%,end
She needs to hold onto that title.

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:42.941 line:95%,end
She needs to move forward.

00:25:43.008 --> 00:25:44.009 line:95%,end
She needs to get better.

Chloe, you are the national title holder.

00:25:59.391 --> 00:26:03.295 line:95%,end
You have two more days
to fix this combination.

00:26:03.361 --> 00:26:04.829 line:95%,end
Do you understand that?

00:26:04.896 --> 00:26:07.999 line:95%,end
Two days and you're in Denver,
and everybody

00:26:08.066 --> 00:26:11.836 line:95%,end
in the whole country knows that
you're the national winner.

You're either going to look
better than you did or you

00:26:14.439 --> 00:26:15.874 line:95%,end
rested on your
laurels and you think

00:26:15.941 --> 00:26:19.144 line:95%,end
you don't have to work anymore
because you already won.

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:21.012 line:95%,end
It's up to you.


00:26:21.079 --> 00:26:22.681 line:95%,end
Go get Maddie.

00:26:28.753 --> 00:26:30.288 line:95%,end
I'm warning you up front--

00:26:30.355 --> 00:26:32.190 line:95%,end
you cry today, you're finished.

00:26:32.257 --> 00:26:33.058 line:95%,end
No solos.

00:26:33.124 --> 00:26:33.858 line:95%,end
Got it?

00:26:33.925 --> 00:26:36.761 line:95%,end
Drop over, come up.

00:26:36.828 --> 00:26:38.029 line:95%,end
Peace.

00:26:38.096 --> 00:26:42.367 line:95%,end
I give Maddie a solo because Maddie
had the best attendance over the break.

00:26:44.569 --> 00:26:46.037 line:95%,end
Breathe.

00:26:47.072 --> 00:26:48.974 line:95%,end
OK. You're a little early.

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:50.475 line:95%,end
You have time for a double compass.

00:26:50.542 --> 00:26:51.543 line:95%,end

00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:53.244 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I think Maddie was definitely
a little threatened.

00:26:53.311 --> 00:26:57.749 line:5%,start
So now that Ally's on the team,
you know, tensions are starting to--

00:26:57.816 --> 00:27:01.019 line:5%,start
you know, it's starting
already, first competition.

00:27:01.086 --> 00:27:04.022 line:95%,end
As we go on I want to get
a little more difficult.

00:27:04.089 --> 00:27:05.357 line:95%,end
I want it to be more mature.

00:27:05.423 --> 00:27:06.891 line:95%,end
You have two more days.

00:27:06.958 --> 00:27:08.193 line:95%,end
That's all you have.

00:27:08.259 --> 00:27:09.995 line:95%,end
And I want you to get a copy
of the music, Gianna.

00:27:10.061 --> 00:27:11.930 line:95%,end
So listen to the words,
listen to the story.

00:27:11.997 --> 00:27:13.465 line:95%,end
It's beautiful. OK?

00:27:13.531 --> 00:27:14.532 line:95%,end
All right, you're good.
You can go.

00:27:14.599 --> 00:27:15.333 line:95%,end
Thank you.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:16.935 line:95%,end
You're welcome.

ABBY: Now remember, Mackenzie,
you have come a long way, kiddo.

00:27:30.081 --> 00:27:32.717 line:95%,end
You were just a dumb little kid
doing your little thing

00:27:32.784 --> 00:27:35.387 line:95%,end
with the big sister who was amazing.

00:27:35.453 --> 00:27:37.622 line:95%,end
Now you have a national title.

00:27:38.957 --> 00:27:41.226 line:95%,end
Mackenzie has a solo this week, too.

00:27:41.292 --> 00:27:42.727 line:95%,end
It's called "Goodie Goodie."

00:27:42.794 --> 00:27:46.097 line:95%,end
It's sassy, it's cute,
it's age appropriate.

00:27:46.164 --> 00:27:48.133 line:95%,end
We're good.
We're good.

00:27:48.199 --> 00:27:49.934 line:95%,end
Good.
Good.

00:27:50.001 --> 00:27:51.536 line:95%,end
Not good.
Do the walk.

00:27:51.603 --> 00:27:54.806 line:95%,end
Big. Big, but really-- like,
you're looking down at the floor.

00:27:54.873 --> 00:27:56.441 line:95%,end
You need to look up in the air.

00:27:56.508 --> 00:27:58.543 line:95%,end
These two walks are really bad.

00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:02.614 line:95%,end
You need to be, like, sassy and really
swing your head when you're upstage.

00:28:02.681 --> 00:28:05.450 line:95%,end
Last year, at the end of the
season when you won your title,

00:28:05.517 --> 00:28:07.786 line:95%,end
you were hitting more than a split.

00:28:07.852 --> 00:28:09.287 line:95%,end
Now you're barely in a split.

00:28:09.354 --> 00:28:10.889 line:95%,end
Understand?

00:28:10.955 --> 00:28:13.925 line:95%,end
That's what I'm talking about,
about the end of the season you

00:28:13.992 --> 00:28:15.160 line:95%,end
were up here.

00:28:15.226 --> 00:28:17.429 line:95%,end
And now you're, like,
not quite up there.

00:28:17.495 --> 00:28:18.763 line:95%,end
OK?

00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:21.433 line:5%,start
MACKENZIE: The choreography
for this dance is hard.

00:28:21.499 --> 00:28:23.501 line:5%,start
And it makes me a little nervous.

00:28:23.568 --> 00:28:26.438 line:95%,end
I just told your moms this whole story.

00:28:26.504 --> 00:28:28.306 line:95%,end
Now I'm going to tell you, real quick.

00:28:28.373 --> 00:28:32.677 line:95%,end
You are not at the level you
were on last season,

00:28:32.744 --> 00:28:34.646 line:95%,end
when you won the National Championship.

00:28:34.713 --> 00:28:35.747 line:95%,end
You won a title.

00:28:35.814 --> 00:28:36.815 line:95%,end
You want a title.

00:28:36.881 --> 00:28:38.316 line:95%,end
Brooke won a title.

00:28:38.383 --> 00:28:42.654 line:95%,end
And you haven't stepped on stage
in how many weeks?

00:28:42.721 --> 00:28:47.125 line:95%,end
And now you're going to go all
the way to Denver and perform?

00:28:47.192 --> 00:28:47.926 line:95%,end
Really?

00:28:47.992 --> 00:28:48.693 line:95%,end
I'm crazy.

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:50.361 line:95%,end
I think I'm crazy.

00:28:50.428 --> 00:28:52.163 line:95%,end
So you're going to do this number for me.

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:56.367 line:95%,end
And if it's not perfect,
I will pull all the demons.

00:28:56.434 --> 00:28:59.337 line:95%,end
And, Ally, you will do the angel part
as a solo.

00:28:59.404 --> 00:29:00.839 line:95%,end
Understood?

00:29:00.905 --> 00:29:03.341 line:95%,end
That means you won't be dancing, at all.

00:29:03.408 --> 00:29:07.045 line:95%,end
HOLLY: She cannot possibly
be seriously considering scrapping

00:29:07.112 --> 00:29:10.048 line:95%,end
the group number and putting in someone
who just walked in off the street

00:29:10.115 --> 00:29:12.117 line:95%,end
and giving her a solo?

00:29:12.183 --> 00:29:13.618 line:95%,end
That's outrageous.

00:29:13.685 --> 00:29:17.555 line:95%,end
That means my child will have nothing
to do during this dance competition.

00:29:17.622 --> 00:29:20.425 line:5%,start
[music playing]

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:23.528 line:95%,end
MELISSA: So if we don't do this
group dance,

00:29:23.595 --> 00:29:25.230 line:95%,end
that means Nia is not dancing.
- Yeah.

00:29:25.296 --> 00:29:26.131 line:95%,end
Whoa!

00:29:26.197 --> 00:29:28.299 line:95%,end
That's wrong.

00:29:28.366 --> 00:29:30.368 line:95%,end
Her name is Abby Lee Miller.

00:29:30.435 --> 00:29:33.571 line:95%,end
She has wrong as her middle name.

00:29:33.638 --> 00:29:36.207 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:29:37.742 --> 00:29:39.344 line:95%,end
Get up.
I'm going to give you a hug.

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:40.411 line:95%,end
That was great.

00:29:40.478 --> 00:29:41.479 line:95%,end
[laughs]

00:29:41.546 --> 00:29:43.715 line:95%,end
Ally just did the number as a solo,
the group number.

00:29:43.782 --> 00:29:45.383 line:95%,end
So we're worried
that she's taking everybody

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:47.352 line:95%,end
out of the dance and just
putting your daughter as a solo.

00:29:47.418 --> 00:29:49.554 line:95%,end
Oh, gosh.
I hope that doesn't happen.

00:29:49.621 --> 00:29:51.055 line:95%,end
That means Nia won't
be dancing, at all.

00:29:51.122 --> 00:29:53.091 line:95%,end
HOLLY: At this point,
we're getting really close to going

00:29:53.158 --> 00:29:55.226 line:95%,end
to competition and don't want to waste
my time.

00:29:55.293 --> 00:29:57.896 line:95%,end
And I know as much
as I hate to do it,

00:29:57.962 --> 00:30:01.533 line:95%,end
I'm going to have to go downstairs
and talk to Abby about this.

00:30:01.599 --> 00:30:02.400 line:95%,end
Abby!

00:30:02.467 --> 00:30:03.601 line:95%,end
ABBY: What?

00:30:03.668 --> 00:30:05.703 line:95%,end
I don't want to go all across the country

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:09.174 line:95%,end
to have my child not dance
in a group or a solo.

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:11.709 line:95%,end
ABBY: Suddenly, Holly really cares.

00:30:11.776 --> 00:30:14.746 line:95%,end
I mean, she doesn't want to go
all the way to Denver

00:30:14.813 --> 00:30:16.214 line:95%,end
if Nia doesn't have a solo.

00:30:16.281 --> 00:30:17.048 line:95%,end
Well, you know what?

00:30:17.115 --> 00:30:18.483 line:95%,end
Too bad.

00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:20.885 line:95%,end
You're part of the team,
and this is what we're doing.

00:30:20.952 --> 00:30:22.954 line:95%,end
Don't keep bitching away when
your kid's not in a number!

00:30:23.021 --> 00:30:24.155 line:95%,end
I'm not.

00:30:24.222 --> 00:30:25.390 line:95%,end
ABBY: They should've been here, training.

00:30:25.456 --> 00:30:27.091 line:95%,end
HOLLY: But my thing is,
Abby, you're not God.

00:30:27.158 --> 00:30:28.459 line:95%,end
I'm just-- all I'm asking--

00:30:28.526 --> 00:30:29.861 line:95%,end
Then what are you doing in here,
wasting my time?

00:30:29.928 --> 00:30:32.096 line:95%,end
All I'm asking you,
is Nia in the group dance or not?

00:30:32.163 --> 00:30:32.964 line:95%,end
That's all I'm asking.

00:30:33.031 --> 00:30:34.165 line:95%,end
ABBY: Ask me, then.

00:30:34.232 --> 00:30:36.267 line:95%,end
The last time Abby pulled this stunt, Nia

00:30:36.334 --> 00:30:38.069 line:95%,end
did not dance in a group number.

00:30:38.136 --> 00:30:41.039 line:95%,end
If she's going to Denver,
I am expecting that she's

00:30:41.105 --> 00:30:42.273 line:95%,end
going to do the group number.

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:44.209 line:95%,end
ABBY: I don't know if
that's going to happen.

Hello!

SHELLY: Wow.
- Yeah.

00:30:59.924 --> 00:31:04.262 line:95%,end
OK. Can I get a dozen of these
to go, in a box with--

00:31:04.329 --> 00:31:07.899 line:95%,end
Ally came onto this competition
team in a whirlwind.

00:31:07.966 --> 00:31:09.734 line:5%,start
Her and her mom haven't even had time

00:31:09.801 --> 00:31:11.836 line:5%,start
to adjust to living in Pittsburgh.

00:31:11.903 --> 00:31:13.605 line:5%,start
I want to get to know them better,

00:31:13.671 --> 00:31:15.173 line:5%,start
and see what they're all about.

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:17.575 line:95%,end
What do you think of the moms, altogether?

00:31:17.642 --> 00:31:19.077 line:95%,end
I mean, they've been nice.

00:31:19.143 --> 00:31:22.447 line:95%,end
You know, they're very honest,
you know, very forthcoming.

00:31:22.513 --> 00:31:23.815 line:95%,end
But they've been--
they've been--

00:31:23.882 --> 00:31:25.817 line:95%,end
Well, they think
you're a big dance mom--

00:31:25.884 --> 00:31:27.018 line:95%,end
I'm not.
[laughs]

00:31:27.085 --> 00:31:29.487 line:95%,end
--and you're just being
sweet and nice and--

00:31:29.554 --> 00:31:30.555 line:95%,end
Yeah.

00:31:30.622 --> 00:31:32.690 line:95%,end
--that you don't want to make waves
and blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:31:32.757 --> 00:31:33.625 line:95%,end
And I'm like--

00:31:33.691 --> 00:31:34.859 line:95%,end
- No.
- --I don't know.

00:31:34.926 --> 00:31:36.427 line:95%,end
Because, you know,
you have an older child,

00:31:36.494 --> 00:31:38.596 line:95%,end
so you've been through all this crap.
- Yeah.

00:31:38.663 --> 00:31:43.001 line:95%,end
ABBY: Shelley has an older daughter
who danced competitively for years.

00:31:43.067 --> 00:31:46.037 line:95%,end
She's been through all the hoops before.

00:31:46.104 --> 00:31:50.508 line:95%,end
I don't think these mothers
are going to intimidate her, at all.

00:31:50.575 --> 00:31:53.011 line:95%,end
So she's really excited
about dancing this weekend.

00:31:53.077 --> 00:31:54.212 line:95%,end
I'm nervous.

00:31:54.279 --> 00:31:56.948 line:95%,end
I hope Ally-- you know, she's never
had the two-day challenge before,

00:31:57.015 --> 00:31:58.349 line:95%,end
so I'm hoping she stands up to it.

00:31:58.416 --> 00:31:59.350 line:95%,end
She'll be fine.

00:31:59.417 --> 00:32:01.486 line:95%,end
But what-- what
should I expect?

00:32:01.552 --> 00:32:02.954 line:95%,end
My biggest advice to you--

00:32:04.589 --> 00:32:06.624 line:95%,end
never let them see you sweat.

00:32:07.625 --> 00:32:09.694 line:95%,end
Never let them see you cry

00:32:10.528 --> 00:32:11.663 line:95%,end
because you're vulnerable.

00:32:11.729 --> 00:32:13.097 line:95%,end
Think before you speak.

00:32:13.164 --> 00:32:15.733 line:95%,end
And, whatever you say, it's a statement.

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:17.535 line:95%,end
You know, put a period on the end of it.

00:32:17.602 --> 00:32:21.239 line:95%,end
Don't let them come down on you
and talk about you and this and that.

00:32:21.306 --> 00:32:24.342 line:95%,end
They have driven away more customers.

00:32:24.409 --> 00:32:25.777 line:95%,end
Nip it in the bud.

Ugh!

ABBY (VOICEOVER): The team
is certainly not ready to go to Denver.

00:32:43.761 --> 00:32:46.197 line:95%,end
I think the group dance could be good

00:32:46.264 --> 00:32:49.801 line:95%,end
if they nail it
or it could be a mess if they screw it up.

[cheering and applause]

00:32:50.935 --> 00:32:52.270 line:95%,end
Come on, girls.

00:32:53.237 --> 00:32:55.740 line:95%,end
Hopefully, all eyes will be on Ally.

00:32:55.807 --> 00:32:57.241 line:95%,end
She's going to look stunning.

00:32:57.308 --> 00:33:00.912 line:95%,end
And, hopefully, the judges won't

Oh, my goodness!

00:33:04.082 --> 00:33:07.919 line:95%,end
Oh, finally, we have a dance studio!

00:33:08.786 --> 00:33:10.688 line:95%,end
- Yeah!
- Yes! We get the mirrors!

00:33:10.755 --> 00:33:15.393 line:95%,end
All right, girls, remember you
are the National Champions,

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:17.028 line:95%,end
so on your best behavior.

00:33:17.095 --> 00:33:19.263 line:95%,end
I don't want to see any of that baby,
bratty crying.

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:20.331 line:95%,end
Got it?

00:33:21.833 --> 00:33:23.001 line:95%,end
I'm serious.

00:33:23.067 --> 00:33:24.802 line:5%,start
I'm nervous I'm going to forget my dance.

00:33:24.869 --> 00:33:27.271 line:95%,end
ABBY: Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go! Come on!

00:33:27.338 --> 00:33:29.273 line:95%,end
Abby, are solos first?

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:30.908 line:95%,end
ABBY: Solos are first.

00:33:30.975 --> 00:33:34.912 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Well, since solos are first,
did you make--

00:33:34.979 --> 00:33:36.948 line:95%,end
can we get some guidance
about the group number?

00:33:37.015 --> 00:33:38.082 line:95%,end
Because--

00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:39.717 line:95%,end
I did not even think about it, Holly.

00:33:39.784 --> 00:33:42.320 line:95%,end
I haven't even thought about
it until I see everybody today.

00:33:42.387 --> 00:33:43.454 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Well, that's nice.

00:33:43.521 --> 00:33:46.290 line:95%,end
But you won't see Nia perform today
because she doesn't have a solo.

00:33:46.357 --> 00:33:48.893 line:95%,end
We did come all the way over
here as part of the team,

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.962 line:95%,end
so I don't want it to be in vain.

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:53.431 line:95%,end
This is a team.

00:33:53.498 --> 00:33:55.133 line:95%,end
This is my team.

00:33:55.199 --> 00:33:57.468 line:95%,end
When I know what I'm doing with the group

00:33:57.535 --> 00:33:58.736 line:95%,end
I'll let you know, Holly.

00:33:58.803 --> 00:34:02.774 line:95%,end
Until then, stop chirping about it.

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:05.009 line:95%,end
You're only making yourself
look desperate.

00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:09.280 line:95%,end
Chloe, you are the national winner.

00:34:09.347 --> 00:34:10.748 line:95%,end
And I have stressed that to you.

00:34:10.815 --> 00:34:13.017 line:95%,end
And even though your mother
is insisted that you did not

00:34:13.084 --> 00:34:15.653 line:95%,end
miss at all over the break,
I'm still telling you,

00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:19.123 line:95%,end
you're not where you were
at the end of last season.

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:20.792 line:95%,end
And that's what breaks are for.

00:34:20.858 --> 00:34:21.659 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:34:21.726 --> 00:34:22.894 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: Abby rules by fear.

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:25.963 line:5%,start
And she made it clear that each
of those girls had something to fear.

00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:27.598 line:95%,end
And, for Chloe, it was you're only

00:34:27.665 --> 00:34:28.699 line:95%,end
as good as your last dance.

00:34:28.766 --> 00:34:29.567 line:95%,end
Well, you know what?

00:34:29.634 --> 00:34:30.835 line:95%,end
Her last dance was pretty good.

00:34:30.902 --> 00:34:33.738 line:95%,end
[cheering and applause]

00:34:35.273 --> 00:34:36.207 line:95%,end
ABBY: Uh-uh.

00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:37.341 line:95%,end
Right there, posture.

00:34:37.408 --> 00:34:39.444 line:95%,end
Get those arms behind you.

00:34:42.246 --> 00:34:44.015 line:95%,end
I don't know, but--

00:34:44.082 --> 00:34:45.817 line:95%,end
I miss my friend.

00:34:46.451 --> 00:34:48.519 line:95%,end
Yeah. I miss her, too.

00:34:48.586 --> 00:34:50.988 line:95%,end
Well, we all do.
I don't know about Abby.

00:34:51.055 --> 00:34:52.156 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: She's such a witch.

00:34:52.223 --> 00:34:53.491 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Kelly is just Kelly.

00:34:53.558 --> 00:34:55.159 line:5%,start
I mean, it's just part of our group.

00:34:55.226 --> 00:34:57.662 line:5%,start
We might not all get along all the time,

00:34:57.728 --> 00:35:01.532 line:5%,start
but at the end of the day,
we are a dysfunctional family.

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:03.501 line:95%,end
It's weird.

00:35:03.568 --> 00:35:04.769 line:95%,end
Today is weird.

00:35:04.836 --> 00:35:06.471 line:95%,end
MELISSA: That's why we keep saying
we're missing one.

00:35:06.537 --> 00:35:07.672 line:95%,end
It's Kelly.

00:35:07.738 --> 00:35:08.873 line:95%,end
It's weird.

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:10.108 line:95%,end
Like, I'm sitting here and I'm looking.

00:35:10.174 --> 00:35:12.877 line:95%,end
And, like, it's weird
not to have Kelly here.

00:35:12.944 --> 00:35:15.413 line:95%,end
I'm sorry, Shelly, it's still her seat.


00:35:20.084 --> 00:35:20.751 line:5%,start
[music playing]

00:35:20.818 --> 00:35:21.586 line:5%,start
[cheering and applause]

00:35:23.454 --> 00:35:27.825 line:95%,end
It's very clear that I'm in Kelly's seat.

00:35:27.892 --> 00:35:30.728 line:95%,end
And Ally's in Paige and Brooke's seat.

00:35:30.795 --> 00:35:32.196 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Ally's in Brooke's jacket.

00:35:32.263 --> 00:35:33.264 line:95%,end
SHELLY: Yeah. Yeah.

00:35:33.331 --> 00:35:35.066 line:95%,end
I don't even know Kelly.

00:35:35.133 --> 00:35:37.068 line:95%,end
I don't really know the history behind it

00:35:37.135 --> 00:35:38.603 line:95%,end
or why she didn't come back.

00:35:38.669 --> 00:35:43.407 line:95%,end
But, if it's Kelly's choice, then I know--

00:35:43.474 --> 00:35:45.076 line:95%,end
I don't know what to say.

00:35:45.143 --> 00:35:47.245 line:95%,end
Well, I'll tell you one thing
you could say.

00:35:47.311 --> 00:35:50.414 line:95%,end
If she tries to make
that group dance a solo,

00:35:50.481 --> 00:35:53.050 line:95%,end
you should stand up
and say my daughter is not doing it.

00:35:53.117 --> 00:35:54.752 line:95%,end
But I'm not the teacher.

00:35:54.819 --> 00:35:57.788 line:95%,end
Like, I don't tell the algebra teacher
how to teach algebra,

00:35:57.855 --> 00:36:00.258 line:95%,end
so why would I tell a dance teacher
how to teach dance

00:36:00.324 --> 00:36:01.492 line:95%,end
or how to make those decisions?

00:36:01.559 --> 00:36:03.060 line:95%,end
Telling her you would
rather do the group

00:36:03.127 --> 00:36:05.029 line:95%,end
not a solo isn't telling the dance teacher

00:36:05.096 --> 00:36:06.430 line:95%,end
how to teach dance.
- No, you are.

00:36:06.497 --> 00:36:08.199 line:95%,end
If that's what she chose to do--

00:36:08.266 --> 00:36:11.102 line:95%,end
now, I'm not going to tell her what to do

00:36:11.169 --> 00:36:12.436 line:95%,end
with her creative license.

00:36:12.503 --> 00:36:14.105 line:5%,start
JILL: I don't know what Shelly is up to,

00:36:14.172 --> 00:36:17.308 line:5%,start
but this is really heartbreaking to me.

00:36:17.375 --> 00:36:21.779 line:95%,end
I'm not sure Shelly is going to last
with this group of dance moms.

00:36:21.846 --> 00:36:24.081 line:95%,end
I can't predict it.
It doesn't look good.

00:36:30.788 --> 00:36:31.722 line:95%,end
She's no dummy.

00:36:31.789 --> 00:36:32.490 line:95%,end
You put the--

00:36:32.557 --> 00:36:33.624 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: No, she's not.

00:36:33.691 --> 00:36:35.092 line:95%,end
She knows exactly what she's doing.

00:36:35.159 --> 00:36:38.095 line:95%,end
She's here for one purpose,
one purpose only.

00:36:38.563 --> 00:36:40.097 line:95%,end
ABBY: How's it going in there?

00:36:40.164 --> 00:36:41.165 line:95%,end
OK.

00:36:41.232 --> 00:36:44.402 line:95%,end
Just-- if you want to just
give me peace right now

00:36:44.468 --> 00:36:45.570 line:95%,end
and let me get through
this first competition--

00:36:45.636 --> 00:36:46.737 line:95%,end
Tell them they're doing the group?

00:36:46.804 --> 00:36:48.606 line:95%,end
--please just tell them
they're doing the group.

00:36:48.673 --> 00:36:50.775 line:95%,end
HOLLY: I can't believe that
she said that, as a mom,

00:36:50.841 --> 00:36:53.911 line:95%,end
she would not question
a teacher's decision.

00:36:53.978 --> 00:36:55.379 line:95%,end
You're the mother.

00:36:55.446 --> 00:36:58.583 line:95%,end
You get to decide what's morally
right and what's morally wrong.

00:36:58.649 --> 00:37:01.285 line:95%,end
If you know a teacher
is doing something that's wrong,

00:37:01.352 --> 00:37:02.820 line:95%,end
you get to be able to say--

00:37:02.887 --> 00:37:04.589 line:95%,end
instruct the teachers, like, that's wrong.

00:37:04.655 --> 00:37:06.490 line:95%,end
You're sending the wrong
message to my child.

00:37:06.557 --> 00:37:07.758 line:95%,end
I really want it to be a group.

00:37:07.825 --> 00:37:08.759 line:95%,end
- Well, you know what?
- It's just so beautiful.

00:37:08.826 --> 00:37:09.794 line:95%,end
It's a group.
It's a group.

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:11.195 line:95%,end
There's no doubt that it's a group.

00:37:11.262 --> 00:37:12.697 line:95%,end
It's just that I got to keep them--

00:37:12.763 --> 00:37:13.631 line:95%,end
- I know.
- --in control.

00:37:13.698 --> 00:37:15.066 line:95%,end
I know.

00:37:15.132 --> 00:37:16.601 line:95%,end
I can't have a studio where
the mothers run the show.

00:37:16.667 --> 00:37:17.668 line:95%,end
I know.

00:37:17.735 --> 00:37:18.970 line:95%,end
- That does not work for me.
- I know.

00:37:19.036 --> 00:37:20.037 line:95%,end
I know.

00:37:20.104 --> 00:37:23.908 line:95%,end
I have to say that I am not sure

00:37:25.843 --> 00:37:28.312 line:95%,end
Shelly fits in.

00:37:30.548 --> 00:37:32.783 line:95%,end
Like, when she speaks,
birds fly out of her mouth.

00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:34.318 line:95%,end
When I speak, fire comes out of mine.

I just wanted to talk
to you for a minute

Oh, I know you're not the same Chloe.

Oh-- you're not.

to Maddie and Kendall,

00:39:33.537 --> 00:39:35.306 line:95%,end
are you going to let Chloe beat you again?

00:39:35.373 --> 00:39:36.574 line:95%,end
It's not always about winning.

You know, this is your first dance back,

so don't think of it as, you know,
I better go out there and I better win.

Think of it, oh, this is like,
a victory performance.

00:40:03.701 --> 00:40:05.336 line:5%,start
I'm a little bit nervous.

00:40:05.403 --> 00:40:08.372 line:5%,start
I think Miss Abby's putting
kind of a lot of pressure on me

00:40:08.439 --> 00:40:10.174 line:5%,start
because I won Nationals.

00:40:10.241 --> 00:40:12.176 line:95%,end
And she wants me to go out there
and win, again.

00:40:12.243 --> 00:40:14.545 line:95%,end
ANNOUNCER: Once again,
this is act number 10 in our Elite

00:40:14.612 --> 00:40:16.013 line:95%,end
Junior Contemporary Solos.

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:18.382 line:95%,end
Please welcome to the stage,
Chloe, with "Nobody's Perfect."

[music playing]

00:40:27.591 --> 00:40:31.328 line:5%,start
(SINGING) It's the mistake you
make that make you who you are.

00:40:31.395 --> 00:40:36.200 line:95%,end
The bigger chance you take
just might take you far.

00:40:36.267 --> 00:40:40.704 line:95%,end
You learn more in this life when you fall.

00:40:40.771 --> 00:40:45.209 line:95%,end
Don't let that stop you,
now, stop you at all.

00:40:45.276 --> 00:40:52.283 line:95%,end
Don't get down on yourself
or want to be somebody else.

00:40:54.251 --> 00:41:00.291 line:95%,end
We all know deep inside,
nobody's perfect.

00:41:02.159 --> 00:41:05.129 line:95%,end
Nobody's perfect.

00:41:06.564 --> 00:41:08.899 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: I am really,
really proud of my daughter

00:41:08.966 --> 00:41:12.069 line:5%,start
because I think that she
is knocking it out of the park

00:41:12.136 --> 00:41:14.405 line:5%,start
not just technically,
but I think she is finally

00:41:14.472 --> 00:41:15.840 line:5%,start
dancing from her heart.

00:41:15.906 --> 00:41:17.174 line:95%,end
And I think you can see it.

00:41:17.241 --> 00:41:21.645 line:95%,end
(SINGING) Don't get down on yourself

00:41:21.712 --> 00:41:24.782 line:95%,end
or want to be somebody else.

00:41:24.849 --> 00:41:26.217 line:95%,end
[cheering and applause]

00:41:26.283 --> 00:41:32.523 line:95%,end
(SINGING) We all know, deep inside,
nobody's perfect.

00:41:34.325 --> 00:41:37.661 line:95%,end
Nobody's perfect.

00:41:44.802 --> 00:41:47.638 line:95%,end
[cheering and applause]

00:41:56.213 --> 00:41:57.948 line:5%,start
- I didn't even know.
- I didn't know that.

00:41:58.015 --> 00:41:59.416 line:95%,end
Yeah. I didn't even know.

00:41:59.483 --> 00:42:02.253 line:95%,end
CHLOE: During my dance I forgot,
like, two steps.


00:42:02.319 --> 00:42:04.755 line:95%,end
And I kept going and thought on my feet.

00:42:04.822 --> 00:42:07.291 line:95%,end
And, I mean, there's definitely things
that I can improve on.

00:42:07.358 --> 00:42:09.426 line:95%,end
But, overall, I thought I did pretty well.

00:42:09.493 --> 00:42:10.294 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:42:10.361 --> 00:42:12.429 line:95%,end
Woo-hoo!

00:42:12.496 --> 00:42:13.597 line:95%,end
Bravo!
Bravo!

00:42:13.664 --> 00:42:14.398 line:95%,end
Bravo!

00:42:14.465 --> 00:42:15.466 line:95%,end
Very nice.

00:42:15.533 --> 00:42:16.800 line:95%,end
Great performance, Chloe. Great.

00:42:16.867 --> 00:42:17.601 line:95%,end
Thank you.

00:42:17.668 --> 00:42:18.702 line:95%,end
Beautiful.

00:42:18.769 --> 00:42:20.104 line:95%,end
Great, great, great, great, great.

00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:22.940 line:95%,end
So, Melissa, she definitely
improved over the break.

00:42:23.007 --> 00:42:24.975 line:95%,end
Either that or she's
been paying attention

00:42:25.042 --> 00:42:28.312 line:95%,end
to little Miss Ally over there.

00:42:30.414 --> 00:42:33.017 line:95%,end
Chloe, the turns--
you didn't do the right turns.

00:42:33.083 --> 00:42:34.184 line:95%,end
You didn't do the--

00:42:34.251 --> 00:42:35.352 line:95%,end
down.

00:42:35.419 --> 00:42:37.988 line:95%,end
You did another turn that was amazing.

00:42:38.055 --> 00:42:41.325 line:95%,end
But, Chloe, someday it's going to matter.

00:42:41.392 --> 00:42:45.963 line:95%,end
Someday you need to remember the
choreography the way it is given to you.

00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:47.798 line:95%,end
If you change something
in the choreography--

00:42:47.865 --> 00:42:50.768 line:95%,end
if you forget it just
put something else in--

00:42:50.834 --> 00:42:55.439 line:95%,end
in a real show when you
are a professional, that doesn't work.

00:42:55.506 --> 00:42:58.809 line:95%,end
That's get fired,
hire somebody else.

00:42:58.876 --> 00:43:00.010 line:95%,end
Understood?

00:43:00.077 --> 00:43:01.412 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I guess Chloe is the new Paige,

00:43:01.478 --> 00:43:03.647 line:95%,end
you know, the punching bag
for all of Abby's insults.

00:43:03.714 --> 00:43:05.182 line:95%,end
I think that, more than anything,

00:43:05.249 --> 00:43:08.185 line:95%,end
Abby is jealous of Chloe
because Chloe has a heart of gold

00:43:08.252 --> 00:43:09.720 line:95%,end
and Abby is dead inside.

00:43:10.888 --> 00:43:12.856 line:95%,end
[cheering and applause]

ABBY: Don't let that hair bother you.

00:43:17.795 --> 00:43:18.696 line:95%,end
Hi!

00:43:18.762 --> 00:43:22.333 line:5%,start
Hey. How are you?
- ABBY: Good. How are you?

00:43:22.399 --> 00:43:24.034 line:5%,start
Long time no see.

00:43:24.101 --> 00:43:25.502 line:5%,start
This is the guy from high school?

00:43:25.569 --> 00:43:28.906 line:5%,start
[laughs] I got a surprise visit
from an old friend of mine.

00:43:28.973 --> 00:43:29.707 line:95%,end
Ladies--

00:43:29.773 --> 00:43:31.108 line:95%,end
You know him?

00:43:31.175 --> 00:43:33.544 line:95%,end
Kelly-- remember the guy
she's always talking about?

00:43:33.611 --> 00:43:35.045 line:95%,end
- It was good to see you.
- See you.

00:43:35.112 --> 00:43:36.413 line:95%,end
- Take care.
- Thanks.

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:37.748 line:95%,end
Hmm.

00:43:37.815 --> 00:43:39.550 line:95%,end
Was that the boy
you stole from Abby?

00:43:39.617 --> 00:43:40.384 line:95%,end
[laughs]

00:43:40.451 --> 00:43:41.352 line:95%,end
Is there-- oh, OK.

00:43:41.418 --> 00:43:42.686 line:95%,end
There's the history there, now.

00:43:42.753 --> 00:43:43.487 line:95%,end
Uh-huh.

00:43:43.554 --> 00:43:44.388 line:95%,end
Oh.

00:43:44.455 --> 00:43:45.322 line:95%,end
ABBY: This is him.

00:43:45.389 --> 00:43:46.423 line:95%,end
Kelly who?

00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:48.859 line:95%,end
Kelly-- ditzy blonde, like, hair.

00:43:48.926 --> 00:43:50.194 line:95%,end
Airhead.

00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:51.061 line:95%,end
You remember.

00:43:51.128 --> 00:43:51.929 line:95%,end
Forgot the routines?

00:43:51.996 --> 00:43:53.063 line:95%,end
[laughter]
- Yes.

00:43:53.130 --> 00:43:54.298 line:95%,end
Oh, got it.

00:43:54.365 --> 00:43:55.399 line:95%,end
You got a beautiful daughter, by the way.

00:43:55.466 --> 00:43:57.601 line:95%,end
- So you live here now?
- I live in Parker, yes.

00:43:57.668 --> 00:43:59.703 line:95%,end
How do all these people
know you out here now?

00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:00.771 line:95%,end
What?

00:44:00.838 --> 00:44:03.273 line:95%,end
It's like, I'm walking down the hall
and everyone's, "Abby, Abby, Abby, Abby."

00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:04.908 line:95%,end
ABBY: I'm somebody, now.
- And these girls--

00:44:04.975 --> 00:44:05.609 line:95%,end
- You know--
- And these girls, too.

00:44:05.676 --> 00:44:07.544 line:95%,end
--I was nothing--
I was nothing in high school.

00:44:07.611 --> 00:44:10.214 line:95%,end
Now I'm somebody. I'm a dance teacher.

00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:11.582 line:95%,end
It's hot in here.

00:44:11.649 --> 00:44:16.587 line:95%,end
Kelly has the mothers believing
that she dated him or went out with him.

00:44:16.654 --> 00:44:18.255 line:95%,end
In the meantime, she was 12.

00:44:18.322 --> 00:44:20.391 line:95%,end
He didn't even remember who she was.

00:44:20.457 --> 00:44:22.459 line:95%,end
- It's nice to see you.
- Can we get together?

00:44:22.526 --> 00:44:23.427 line:95%,end
Tonight?

00:44:23.494 --> 00:44:24.428 line:95%,end
ABBY: Maybe tonight.

00:44:24.495 --> 00:44:26.230 line:95%,end
Can I leave, please?

00:44:26.296 --> 00:44:27.898 line:95%,end
Would you mind?
MELISSA: No, we're fine.

00:44:27.965 --> 00:44:29.266 line:95%,end
Yes, we would.
CHRISTI: No, we wouldn't mind.

00:44:29.333 --> 00:44:30.234 line:95%,end
You haven't finished working.
MELISSA: Look at me.

00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:31.535 line:95%,end
I'm like, you're fine.
[laughs]

00:44:31.602 --> 00:44:33.470 line:95%,end
ABBY: Ally, you want to come out
with Mark and I?

00:44:33.537 --> 00:44:34.972 line:95%,end
We're going to go and watch some numbers.

00:44:35.039 --> 00:44:36.740 line:95%,end
I'm going to talk to him.
You want to go in the theater?

00:44:37.374 --> 00:44:38.776 line:95%,end
OK.
- HOLLY: Bye.

00:44:38.842 --> 00:44:40.110 line:95%,end
Come back, Abby.

00:44:41.311 --> 00:44:44.181 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I don't understand why
she wouldn't take our girls to watch.

00:44:44.248 --> 00:44:45.716 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Because she's wooing her.

00:44:45.783 --> 00:44:47.551 line:95%,end
I really do think she's trying to woo her.

00:44:47.618 --> 00:44:49.887 line:95%,end
And I have something to say.

00:44:49.953 --> 00:44:51.188 line:95%,end
He did date Kelly.

00:44:51.255 --> 00:44:53.590 line:95%,end
He's pretending he didn't,
and he-- they did date.

00:44:53.657 --> 00:44:55.159 line:95%,end
Like, I know for a fact they dated.

00:44:55.225 --> 00:44:56.593 line:95%,end
I thought they did, too.
- JILL: I know they did!

00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:59.063 line:95%,end
Like he probably is afraid
to admit it in front of her

00:44:59.129 --> 00:45:02.332 line:95%,end
because she was so psycho jealous
she tried to slash his tires over it.

00:45:02.399 --> 00:45:03.400 line:95%,end
You know that?

00:45:03.467 --> 00:45:04.835 line:95%,end
Like, she went ballistic over it.

00:45:04.902 --> 00:45:06.437 line:95%,end
Abby liked him.

00:45:06.503 --> 00:45:07.337 line:95%,end
He knows who Kelly is.

00:45:07.404 --> 00:45:08.472 line:95%,end
Yeah.

00:45:08.539 --> 00:45:11.275 line:95%,end
JILL: Did you see, all of a sudden I think
she was trying to hold her stomach in.

00:45:11.341 --> 00:45:12.142 line:95%,end
She got skinny!

00:45:12.209 --> 00:45:12.976 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Jill!

00:45:13.043 --> 00:45:14.344 line:95%,end
Jill!

00:45:14.411 --> 00:45:16.113 line:95%,end
She actually got thin.
Did you notice her outfit today?

00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:17.181 line:95%,end
She looks really skinny.

00:45:17.247 --> 00:45:18.148 line:95%,end
No, I don't think she got thin.

00:45:18.215 --> 00:45:19.316 line:95%,end
She's lost some weight.

00:45:19.383 --> 00:45:20.517 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Yeah, thinner.

00:45:20.584 --> 00:45:21.585 line:95%,end
OK.

00:45:21.652 --> 00:45:23.087 line:95%,end
Like, yeah. No.

OK?

00:45:37.267 --> 00:45:38.502 line:95%,end
First solo of the season, this is yours.

00:45:38.569 --> 00:45:39.570 line:95%,end
You got this.
- OK.

00:45:39.636 --> 00:45:40.137 line:95%,end

Then she struts her stuff
for the magazines.

We all want to be just like her.

She may be over-rated,
but one thing's for sure.

00:46:33.557 --> 00:46:36.560 line:95%,end
She's so opinionated!

00:46:37.127 --> 00:46:40.063 line:95%,end
She's very complicated!

from the first eight count

an amazing performance

00:47:15.532 --> 00:47:18.435 line:95%,end
the number was good.

00:47:18.502 --> 00:47:20.604 line:95%,end
It wasn't fabulous.

00:47:20.971 --> 00:47:23.373 line:95%,end
- There's Kendall!
- Good job, Kendall!

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:24.775 line:95%,end
- Good job, Kendall K!
- You did great, Kendall.

00:47:24.842 --> 00:47:25.876 line:95%,end
- Come here, Kendall.
- You did really well, honey.

00:47:25.943 --> 00:47:26.510 line:95%,end
- You did awesome!
- You did it.

00:47:26.577 --> 00:47:27.277 line:95%,end
It feel good?

00:47:27.344 --> 00:47:28.078 line:95%,end
Huh?

00:47:28.145 --> 00:47:29.279 line:95%,end
You all right?

00:47:29.346 --> 00:47:30.113 line:95%,end
You settled down?

00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:30.981 line:95%,end
All right.

00:47:31.048 --> 00:47:32.783 line:95%,end
Kendall, what did you think?

00:47:32.850 --> 00:47:33.717 line:95%,end
I thought it was good.

00:47:33.784 --> 00:47:34.952 line:95%,end
I thought it was entertaining.

00:47:35.018 --> 00:47:35.819 line:95%,end
I thought it was fun.

00:47:35.886 --> 00:47:37.120 line:95%,end
But, you know what?

00:47:37.187 --> 00:47:39.656 line:95%,end
You were the one that was
there during the break.

00:47:39.723 --> 00:47:41.158 line:95%,end
You were the one that was improving.

00:47:41.225 --> 00:47:42.726 line:95%,end
You're the one that had the privates.

00:47:42.793 --> 00:47:46.530 line:95%,end
I think you should've blown
Maddie and Chloe out of the water.

00:47:48.198 --> 00:47:50.801 line:95%,end
That's what I think.
Are you in agreement?

00:47:50.868 --> 00:47:51.902 line:95%,end
Absolutely.

00:47:51.969 --> 00:47:53.570 line:95%,end
Good answer, Jill.

00:47:53.637 --> 00:47:54.504 line:95%,end
You're learning.

00:47:54.571 --> 00:47:55.572 line:95%,end
Wow.

00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:01.144 line:95%,end
So I'm glad you put the group costume
on because you can do the group dance.

00:48:01.211 --> 00:48:02.579 line:95%,end
I have to think about the team.

00:48:02.646 --> 00:48:05.315 line:95%,end
And sometimes, Holly,
it's better to not dance and sit

00:48:05.382 --> 00:48:09.987 line:95%,end
in the audience than go out
and not be ready and look like crap.

00:48:10.053 --> 00:48:13.357 line:5%,start
I tried to tell Holly,
just wait and let me see.

00:48:13.423 --> 00:48:14.992 line:95%,end
She didn't get it through her head

00:48:15.058 --> 00:48:19.129 line:95%,end
that I was strategically
watching the other competitors.

00:48:19.196 --> 00:48:21.498 line:95%,end
Those moms may think they know it all,

00:48:21.565 --> 00:48:23.700 line:95%,end
but they don't know half of what I do.

00:48:24.735 --> 00:48:26.036 line:95%,end
All right, let's focus.

00:48:26.103 --> 00:48:28.705 line:95%,end
Nia, just feel everyone around you.

00:48:28.772 --> 00:48:30.507 line:95%,end
If you're too fast, slow down.

00:48:32.476 --> 00:48:34.344 line:95%,end
You nervous, Ally?

00:48:34.411 --> 00:48:36.346 line:95%,end
Nervous in just getting
out there and doing

00:48:36.413 --> 00:48:40.017 line:95%,end
the dance well or nervous
in judges not liking you?

00:48:40.083 --> 00:48:41.351 line:95%,end
What?
What kind of nervous?

00:48:41.418 --> 00:48:43.120 line:5%,start
Letting me down?

00:48:43.186 --> 00:48:46.490 line:5%,start
The pressure that Abby put on me


00:48:46.556 --> 00:48:50.027 line:5%,start
was very stressful because I don't

00:48:50.093 --> 00:48:51.962 line:5%,start
want to screw the dance up.

00:48:52.029 --> 00:48:56.233 line:95%,end
I'm just a little scared
that I won't be able to do it.

00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:57.868 line:95%,end
ANNOUNCER: Act number 20.

00:48:57.935 --> 00:49:00.137 line:95%,end
This is in our
Elite Junior Contemporary Small Group.

00:49:00.203 --> 00:49:04.107 line:95%,end
Please welcome to the stage
"Angels and Demons."

00:49:04.574 --> 00:49:07.210 line:95%,end
[cheering and applause]

[music playing]

00:49:30.867 --> 00:49:35.405 line:95%,end
(SINGING) I woke up this
morning thinking what to wear.

00:49:35.472 --> 00:49:38.475 line:95%,end
Don't know if I should be me.

00:49:38.542 --> 00:49:40.944 line:95%,end
I'm a little scared.

00:49:41.011 --> 00:49:46.416 line:95%,end
My soul has been captured
but I'm in no pain

00:49:46.483 --> 00:49:51.321 line:95%,end
because I'm no angel.

00:49:52.055 --> 00:49:55.692 line:95%,end
I have two faces.

00:49:57.627 --> 00:50:02.766 line:95%,end
I put one on for you,
put one on for me.

00:50:02.833 --> 00:50:08.372 line:95%,end
These angels and demons
won't set me free.

00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:11.908 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I thought
the demons were amazing.

00:50:11.975 --> 00:50:15.245 line:95%,end
And I was watching the demons
because the angel had her own part.

00:50:15.312 --> 00:50:16.046 line:95%,end
And, you know what?

00:50:16.113 --> 00:50:17.280 line:95%,end
My daughter was a demon.

00:50:17.347 --> 00:50:19.816 line:95%,end
So maybe if she was an angel,
I could have said the angel was amazing.

00:50:19.883 --> 00:50:20.984 line:95%,end
But I wasn't watching.

00:50:21.051 --> 00:50:24.554 line:95%,end
(SINGING) --angel!

00:50:24.654 --> 00:50:29.326 line:95%,end
I have two faces.

00:50:30.394 --> 00:50:35.198 line:95%,end
I put one on for you, and one for me.

00:50:35.932 --> 00:50:40.971 line:95%,end
These angels and demons
won't set me

00:50:42.339 --> 00:50:45.942 line:95%,end
free.

00:50:47.377 --> 00:50:50.213 line:95%,end
[cheering and applause]

00:50:52.682 --> 00:50:56.753 line:95%,end
ANNOUNCER: That was act number 20,
"Angels and Demons."

00:50:57.454 --> 00:50:59.156 line:95%,end
When Abby does one of these claps,
that means it's good.

00:50:59.222 --> 00:51:00.190 line:95%,end
Yeah.

00:51:00.257 --> 00:51:02.659 line:95%,end
ABBY: I thought for the first time
out this season

00:51:02.726 --> 00:51:04.795 line:95%,end
the group was pretty darn amazing onstage.

00:51:04.861 --> 00:51:06.963 line:95%,end
Ally was just gorgeous.

00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:09.866 line:95%,end
Her dancing was angelic.

00:51:09.933 --> 00:51:13.437 line:95%,end
I think Ally sold the role of the Angel.

00:51:13.503 --> 00:51:14.838 line:95%,end
[cheering]

00:51:14.905 --> 00:51:16.306 line:95%,end
ABBY: Yay!

00:51:16.373 --> 00:51:18.108 line:95%,end
Hallelujah!

00:51:18.175 --> 00:51:20.110 line:95%,end
Very nice!
Very nice!

00:51:20.177 --> 00:51:23.313 line:95%,end
And my new angel, yay!

00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:25.115 line:95%,end
Oh, my god. You was stunning.

00:51:25.182 --> 00:51:27.617 line:95%,end
She was just this pretty little angel.
It was fabulous.

00:51:27.684 --> 00:51:28.852 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:51:28.919 --> 00:51:29.953 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Abby comes in the dressing room,

00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:33.256 line:95%,end
and I think it's so funny that she gives
Ally all the credit for the group dance.

00:51:33.323 --> 00:51:36.293 line:5%,start
Like, wouldn't you want to give your
dancers credit, that you've trained?

00:51:36.359 --> 00:51:38.662 line:5%,start
Isn't it your name and your reputation?

00:51:38.728 --> 00:51:41.465 line:95%,end
ABBY: Mackenzie, I made some changes
in your solo and you're up.

00:51:41.531 --> 00:51:43.333 line:95%,end
So I think you need
to get those socks off

00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:46.670 line:95%,end
and we need to warm up
and go through those changes.

00:51:46.736 --> 00:51:48.505 line:95%,end
And what happens if you forget?

00:51:48.572 --> 00:51:52.075 line:95%,end
You cannot be a national title holder
and run off the stage

00:51:52.142 --> 00:51:53.310 line:95%,end
because you forgot your dance.

00:51:53.376 --> 00:51:56.580 line:95%,end
There will be none of that this season.

00:51:56.646 --> 00:51:58.515 line:95%,end
Melissa, if she runs off that stage

00:51:58.582 --> 00:52:00.417 line:95%,end
she can keep on running
right back to Pittsburgh.

00:52:00.484 --> 00:52:01.485 line:95%,end
OK.


00:52:05.155 --> 00:52:06.156 line:5%,start
[music playing]

00:52:07.257 --> 00:52:08.725 line:5%,start
MACKENZIE: I can't forget the solo.

00:52:08.792 --> 00:52:11.528 line:5%,start
I want to win like Maddie won at my age.

00:52:13.296 --> 00:52:14.397 line:95%,end
Kenz, you know it.

00:52:14.464 --> 00:52:15.665 line:95%,end
GIANNA: Let's go from the top.

00:52:15.732 --> 00:52:17.234 line:95%,end
Here.

00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:18.368 line:95%,end
I'll get the song.

00:52:18.435 --> 00:52:20.003 line:95%,end
--and she's going to be great.

00:52:20.070 --> 00:52:22.305 line:95%,end
Before Mackenzie went on stage,

00:52:22.372 --> 00:52:25.175 line:5%,start
we all prayed so that Mackenzie
wouldn't forget her dance

00:52:25.242 --> 00:52:27.043 line:5%,start
and she would run off and cry.

00:52:27.110 --> 00:52:29.613 line:95%,end
Because I don't want Mackenzie
to forget her dance,

00:52:29.679 --> 00:52:31.381 line:95%,end
and I don't want Abby to yell at her.

00:52:31.448 --> 00:52:34.417 line:95%,end
ANNOUNCER: All right. Next up on stage
in our Elite Mini Acro Solo,

Goodie goodie.

00:52:49.299 --> 00:52:53.069 line:95%,end
Goodie goodie, I want plenty.

Coming back for more.

Goodie goodie.

Goodie goodie, give me plenty.

Goodie goodie, I want plenty.

MELISSA: Mackenzie comes out on stage.

00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:22.532 line:95%,end
Her turns were good,
her tricks were great,

00:53:22.599 --> 00:53:24.634 line:5%,start
then all of a sudden her
bow flies out of her hair.

00:53:24.701 --> 00:53:26.836 line:95%,end
(SINGING) I want plenty.

00:53:26.903 --> 00:53:28.505 line:95%,end
Coming back for more.

00:53:28.572 --> 00:53:30.807 line:95%,end
Go!
Come on.

Yum, yum.

00:53:35.979 --> 00:53:37.714 line:95%,end
Give me some.

Kenz, you did it!

00:53:50.393 --> 00:53:51.161 line:5%,start
No.

00:53:51.228 --> 00:53:53.330 line:5%,start
She is, Mackenzie.

00:53:53.797 --> 00:53:59.436 line:5%,start
ABBY: , Melissa you should have learned
from the very first competition we did,

00:53:59.502 --> 00:54:02.772 line:5%,start
the headpiece gets sewed in the head.

00:54:03.707 --> 00:54:06.676 line:95%,end
That bow fell on the floor and everybody

00:54:06.743 --> 00:54:11.181 line:95%,end
in the audience watched the bow
instead of watching Mackenzie.

00:54:11.248 --> 00:54:13.617 line:95%,end
Mackenzie was even
watching the bow.

00:54:13.683 --> 00:54:15.819 line:95%,end
That's why she forgot her dance.

00:54:15.885 --> 00:54:17.854 line:95%,end
Thanks, Melissa.

00:54:17.921 --> 00:54:21.891 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Well, Melissa, I still thought
that Mackenzie's dance was great.

00:54:21.958 --> 00:54:24.628 line:95%,end
The caliber of the types of moves
that she did,

00:54:24.694 --> 00:54:25.862 line:95%,end
and her performance was strong.

00:54:25.929 --> 00:54:27.197 line:95%,end
MELISSA: It was.

00:54:27.664 --> 00:54:28.965 line:95%,end
I hear little feet.

MELISSA: Honey, you were great!

Honey, your bow fell out.

00:54:33.136 --> 00:54:33.803 line:5%,start
Don't--

00:54:36.006 --> 00:54:37.674 line:95%,end
You fixed it.
And, you know what?

00:54:37.741 --> 00:54:39.876 line:95%,end
Don't cry when Miss Abby yells.
It's OK.

00:54:39.943 --> 00:54:41.044 line:95%,end
She's going to yell at me.

00:54:41.111 --> 00:54:42.178 line:95%,end
It's OK.

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:47.517 line:95%,end
Mackenzie, what's going on?

00:54:47.584 --> 00:54:49.052 line:95%,end
I thought we talked about no crying.

MELISSA: She didn't.

00:54:51.087 --> 00:54:52.422 line:95%,end
You were crying offstage in the wings.

00:54:52.489 --> 00:54:53.690 line:95%,end
Yes, you were.

00:54:54.991 --> 00:54:57.460 line:95%,end
All right.
Are we ready for awards?

HOLLY: We'll never hear
the end of Abby's mouth

00:55:05.235 --> 00:55:07.404 line:5%,start
if the girls come in second
or if they lose.

00:55:07.971 --> 00:55:10.440 line:95%,end
That's going to be miserable for everyone.

00:55:10.507 --> 00:55:13.009 line:95%,end
And we will hear I told you so.

00:55:13.076 --> 00:55:15.412 line:95%,end
I told you your girls weren't good enough.

00:55:15.478 --> 00:55:17.747 line:95%,end

do not come in first place.

00:55:18.948 --> 00:55:20.417 line:5%,start

Oh, I'm so glad.

00:56:11.901 --> 00:56:14.304 line:5%,start
They call fifth place, and it's Kendall.

00:56:14.371 --> 00:56:17.607 line:5%,start
And I'm very happy, don't get me wrong,

00:56:17.674 --> 00:56:20.176 line:5%,start
that Kendall is in the top five.

00:56:20.243 --> 00:56:23.446 line:95%,end
I was hoping for a higher position.

00:56:23.513 --> 00:56:25.949 line:95%,end
And, I'm just being honest,
that's what I want.

00:56:26.015 --> 00:56:28.485 line:95%,end
It's not bad to want that for your child.

CHRISTI: I think Chloe's going to be

00:56:42.465 --> 00:56:44.634 line:95%,end
at the bottom of the pyramid
next week because Abby looks

00:56:44.701 --> 00:56:46.870 line:95%,end
for any excuse she
can to tear her down.

00:56:46.936 --> 00:56:49.305 line:5%,start
And it doesn't matter
that Chloe got second place.

00:56:49.372 --> 00:56:51.007 line:5%,start
Abby's only going to look at the negative

00:56:51.074 --> 00:56:52.909 line:5%,start

ever does with Chloe.

Chloe, you let Maddie get back on top.

00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:30.046 line:95%,end
You weren't here over the break.
You didn't train.

00:57:30.113 --> 00:57:31.247 line:95%,end
You didn't improve.

00:57:31.314 --> 00:57:32.949 line:95%,end
Do you want to traipse
all over the country

00:57:33.016 --> 00:57:36.152 line:95%,end
or do you want to be the
best dancer that you can be?

00:57:36.219 --> 00:57:38.121 line:95%,end
It's time for you to decide.

00:57:38.188 --> 00:57:43.226 line:95%,end

and I'm proud of the girls.

00:58:33.042 --> 00:58:35.645 line:95%,end
I had to put a winning number
back on the stage.

00:58:35.712 --> 00:58:38.515 line:95%,end
Coming off of a national victory,

00:58:39.916 --> 00:58:41.918 line:95%,end
you can't rest on your laurels.

00:58:41.985 --> 00:58:43.219 line:95%,end
So we did it.

00:58:43.286 --> 00:58:44.888 line:95%,end
The girls went out there,
they were beautiful,

00:58:44.954 --> 00:58:48.057 line:95%,end
it was a great number,

00:58:49.592 --> 00:58:51.594 line:95%,end
You know, the-- I think
the girls were amazing.

00:58:51.661 --> 00:58:54.130 line:95%,end
And I think that dance was fabulous.

00:58:54.197 --> 00:58:56.733 line:95%,end
But, like, what happens next week?

00:58:56.799 --> 00:58:57.800 line:95%,end
You know, like, we go back.

00:58:57.867 --> 00:58:59.269 line:95%,end
Do we have pyramid?

00:58:59.335 --> 00:59:02.038 line:95%,end
When you're featured, it's easier
to get to the top of the pyramid.

00:59:02.105 --> 00:59:03.439 line:95%,end
[cheering]

00:59:03.506 --> 00:59:05.608 line:95%,end

Wow!

That was another clean sweep!

Kenzie, don't get a big head.

00:59:16.019 --> 00:59:17.420 line:95%,end
It's the beginning of the season.

00:59:17.487 --> 00:59:19.756 line:95%,end
There weren't that many people
against you.

00:59:19.822 --> 00:59:21.324 line:95%,end
Understood?

00:59:21.391 --> 00:59:24.427 line:95%,end
Thank you, Ally,
for being a new addition to our team.

00:59:24.494 --> 00:59:27.196 line:95%,end
Girls, do you see what it's
like to have somebody that's

00:59:27.263 --> 00:59:31.334 line:95%,end
inspiring and wants to work hard
and is there?

00:59:31.401 --> 00:59:33.102 line:95%,end
You know, that just isn't
Brooke and Paige.

00:59:33.169 --> 00:59:34.170 line:95%,end
Sorry.

00:59:34.237 --> 00:59:37.006 line:95%,end
But maybe they're reacting
to the way you talk to them.

00:59:37.073 --> 00:59:38.841 line:95%,end
Maybe you should
have been more encouraging.

00:59:38.908 --> 00:59:40.643 line:95%,end
Maybe I should have done a lot of things.

00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:41.511 line:95%,end
But, you know what?

00:59:41.578 --> 00:59:43.012 line:95%,end
Maybe I should get a thank you.

00:59:43.079 --> 00:59:45.148 line:95%,end
Year after year, her kid won a title.

00:59:45.214 --> 00:59:47.517 line:95%,end
Now she [bleep] all over that title.

00:59:47.584 --> 00:59:48.551 line:95%,end
Excuse me, ladies.

00:59:48.618 --> 00:59:49.819 line:95%,end
I don't swear in front of children.

00:59:49.886 --> 00:59:50.954 line:95%,end
But, you know what?

00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:53.189 line:95%,end
That's what they did over the title,

00:59:53.256 --> 00:59:57.527 line:95%,end
over the competition
that was holding the title, everything.

00:59:57.594 --> 01:00:00.330 line:95%,end
And you don't do that,
not in this business.

01:00:00.396 --> 01:00:01.998 line:95%,end
And you just curse in front
of our children, and you--

01:00:02.065 --> 01:00:03.700 line:95%,end
ABBY: That's right.
- Yeah, that's right.

01:00:03.766 --> 01:00:05.034 line:95%,end
Nice role model, Abby.

01:00:05.101 --> 01:00:07.136 line:95%,end
Hey, hit the road, Jack.

01:00:07.203 --> 01:00:09.205 line:95%,end
There's always another kid, always.

01:00:09.272 --> 01:00:11.541 line:95%,end
You're always so eager
to get rid of people.

01:00:11.608 --> 01:00:14.243 line:95%,end
This entire team has made a
commitment and we've been--

01:00:14.310 --> 01:00:15.878 line:95%,end
ABBY: Sacrifice,
sacrifice, sacrifice!

01:00:15.945 --> 01:00:16.713 line:95%,end
I leave my husband.

01:00:16.779 --> 01:00:17.947 line:95%,end
I leave my other daughter.

01:00:18.014 --> 01:00:19.415 line:95%,end
Sacrifice, sacrifice!
It's all OK until you--

01:00:19.482 --> 01:00:21.584 line:95%,end
You wouldn't know because
you don't have anybody else!

01:00:21.651 --> 01:00:22.752 line:95%,end
That's right, sweetheart.

01:00:22.819 --> 01:00:24.520 line:95%,end
You walk out that door, keep walking.

01:00:24.587 --> 01:00:25.722 line:95%,end
You're finished.

01:00:25.788 --> 01:00:27.757 line:95%,end
This week has been quite nice
without Kelly.

01:00:27.824 --> 01:00:30.893 line:95%,end
Now if I could just find a way
to get rid of Christi.

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:34.764 line:95%,end
I'm sorry I swore,
but you've all heard worse.

01:00:34.831 --> 01:00:37.333 line:95%,end
Girls, great job.

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:38.468 line:95%,end
You're dismissed.

01:00:38.534 --> 01:00:40.069 line:95%,end
I'm going to go have dinner.

01:00:41.871 --> 01:00:43.840 line:95%,end
I have an old friend I saw today.

01:00:48.311 --> 01:00:49.779 line:95%,end
I'm so glad you came over here today.

01:00:49.846 --> 01:00:51.748 line:95%,end
That that was a surprise.

01:00:51.814 --> 01:00:53.916 line:95%,end
All right.
Well, let's wrap it up.

01:00:53.983 --> 01:00:55.118 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Oh, what about Kendall's shoes?

01:00:55.184 --> 01:00:57.420 line:95%,end
I heard the fat lady singing in the hall.
It's time to go.

CHRISTI: We need to do some
sort of initiation.

01:01:10.967 --> 01:01:12.935 line:95%,end
We could put E6000 in her eyelash glue

01:01:13.002 --> 01:01:14.971 line:95%,end
because she's wearing eyelashes.

01:01:16.005 --> 01:01:17.540 line:95%,end
ABBY: There's some kids on thin ice.

01:01:17.607 --> 01:01:20.009 line:95%,end
Why you have to do this,
I don't understand.

01:01:20.076 --> 01:01:21.811 line:95%,end
Because you get too big for your britches,
that's what happens.

[cheering]

01:01:23.112 --> 01:01:24.514 line:95%,end
You are more worried
about your friendships

with all of these women than
your own kids, and you know it.

She cheats! She fakes it!

01:01:32.655 --> 01:01:33.890 line:5%,start
You pick on the children!

You're replaced! That's it!

Finished. Done.

See what happens to people?
