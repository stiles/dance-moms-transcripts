JEFF: Coming up on
"The Smoke Before the Fire"--

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:04.904 line:5%,start
They're selling their children.

00:00:04.971 --> 00:00:07.640 line:5%,start
JEFF: Dance moms like you never
seen them before.

00:00:07.707 --> 00:00:09.743 line:5%,start
In her mind she is God.

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.579 line:5%,start
Abby has always had a pretty big ego.

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:15.415 line:5%,start
Maddie's success was not quite
as important

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:16.883 line:5%,start
as her friendship
with the rest of the moms.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.319 line:5%,start
Holly, put that bitch on blast.

00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:21.187 line:5%,start
Dance class is cheaper than rehab.

00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:23.957 line:5%,start
- You fell off the curb.
- She pushed me off the curb.

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:25.392 line:5%,start
I told you, you should have
sued the crap out of her.

00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:28.762 line:5%,start
People love Chloe and it drive her crazy.

00:00:28.828 --> 00:00:31.664 line:5%,start
All the moms have had
some Botox and filler.

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:35.168 line:95%,end
JEFF: Last season,
"Dance Moms" ended in chaos.

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:36.036 line:95%,end
ABBY: I'm done!

00:00:36.102 --> 00:00:39.072 line:95%,end
JEFF: And now, on a special
we call "The Smoke Before the Fire,"

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:42.208 line:95%,end
we've brought Abby and the moms together
to see what's going on

00:00:42.275 --> 00:00:45.078 line:95%,end
as they head into the launch
of season three.

00:00:45.145 --> 00:00:48.314 line:95%,end
Over the next hour, everyone
will take their turn in the hot seat,

00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:51.985 line:95%,end
as our studio audience ask questions
you all want answers to.

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:55.555 line:95%,end
(SINGING) Living on the dance floor.

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:58.591 line:95%,end
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.030 line:5%,start
Hello. I'm Jeff Collins.

00:01:04.097 --> 00:01:06.266 line:5%,start
I'm the executive producer
of "Dance Moms."

00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:09.803 line:95%,end
I know you guys are excited to
start asking some questions,

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.504 line:95%,end
so why don't we get to it?

00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:15.108 line:95%,end
First up, the lady who started it all,
Abby Lee Miller.

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:17.177 line:95%,end
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

00:01:20.713 --> 00:01:23.283 line:95%,end
So, Abby, how does it feel
becoming a little bit famous here?

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:26.719 line:95%,end
I've been doing this for a long time,
Jeff, 30 years. Kids know me.

00:01:26.786 --> 00:01:29.389 line:95%,end
I go to a dance convention, I walk in,
they know me.

00:01:29.456 --> 00:01:32.459 line:95%,end
They know me because I've had winners,
so it's not weird.

00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:36.596 line:95%,end
This is what the moms say, though,
that you have a big inflated ego,

00:01:36.663 --> 00:01:38.832 line:95%,end
that you're more difficult
than ever to deal with.

00:01:38.898 --> 00:01:41.534 line:95%,end
If they think I've changed, they just
don't know me that well.

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:43.303 line:95%,end
All right. Well, I got a little
bit of a curve ball for you.

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.872 line:95%,end
So for the first time in the history
of "Dance Moms,"

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:49.175 line:95%,end
we're going to let the studio audience
ask questions to the cast

00:01:49.242 --> 00:01:51.144 line:95%,end
and to you directly. Are you ready?

00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:53.246 line:95%,end
- ABBY: Yes.
- Who's got a question for Abby?

00:01:53.313 --> 00:01:54.881 line:95%,end
Abby, I was just curious

00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:57.117 line:95%,end
because everybody's always
talking about your love life.

00:01:57.183 --> 00:01:58.785 line:95%,end
Do you have a boyfriend?

00:01:58.852 --> 00:02:01.488 line:95%,end
I have somebody that
cares about me and loves me

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:04.791 line:95%,end
and has a shoulder
for me to lean on.

00:02:04.858 --> 00:02:05.925 line:95%,end
Let's leave it at that.

00:02:05.992 --> 00:02:08.695 line:95%,end
Is that the guy you had your hand
on his butt in the tabloid picture?

00:02:09.863 --> 00:02:11.664 line:95%,end
Maybe, maybe not.

00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:13.700 line:95%,end
JEFF: Who else has
got a question for Abby?

00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:16.803 line:95%,end
Hi, Abby. I was just wondering,
do you really believe that the mothers

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.906 line:95%,end
actually don't appreciate the opportunity
you've given their children?

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:23.943 line:95%,end
I don't think they would appreciate
an opportunity if it landed in their lap.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.314 line:95%,end
They never were respectful. And I think
some of the moms, more so than others.

00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:30.884 line:95%,end
But as a whole, no.
Me, me, me, me, me.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.552 line:95%,end
I, I, I, I, I.

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:34.120 line:95%,end
So, speaking of some
of the other dance moms,

00:02:34.187 --> 00:02:35.989 line:95%,end
tell me about your relationship
with Holly right now.

00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:39.592 line:95%,end
Well, you know, Holly claims to be
a teacher, an educator always.

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.695 line:95%,end
But she left her job.
Now she's a dance mom.

00:02:42.762 --> 00:02:46.733 line:95%,end
She just always wants Nia
to process it

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.736 line:95%,end
and to figure it out and this and that.

00:02:49.802 --> 00:02:52.038 line:95%,end
And I'm like, Holly,
we have 10 seconds here

00:02:52.105 --> 00:02:53.840 line:95%,end
to get on that stage
and do that number.

00:02:53.907 --> 00:02:55.842 line:95%,end
We don't have time to process it.

00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:59.312 line:95%,end
Good luck, Holly.
Holly, put that bitch on blast.

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.447 line:5%,start
JEFF: Speaking of the mom
who's always referred to

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:04.450 line:95%,end
as the rational one,
do you guys like to meet Holly?

00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:06.519 line:95%,end
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:14.561 line:95%,end
- Hello.
- How are you?

00:03:14.627 --> 00:03:15.995 line:95%,end
How are you?

00:03:16.062 --> 00:03:19.365 line:95%,end
Abby and I were just
talking about her relationship with you.

00:03:19.432 --> 00:03:21.901 line:95%,end
And so I want to hear
your side of the story.

00:03:21.968 --> 00:03:24.571 line:95%,end
Right now I think the two of us
get along fairly well.

00:03:24.637 --> 00:03:28.007 line:95%,end
There are times I know
that I get on Abby's nerves,

00:03:28.074 --> 00:03:30.276 line:95%,end
and I also know that Abby really
doesn't really care what I think.

00:03:30.343 --> 00:03:32.378 line:95%,end
But I still feel
that it's important for me

00:03:32.445 --> 00:03:35.715 line:95%,end
to raise my concerns
or my perspective.

00:03:35.782 --> 00:03:38.284 line:95%,end
I want the audience to know
that even though

00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:43.089 line:95%,end
Holly may be angry and upset
and think I crossed some line,

00:03:43.156 --> 00:03:46.226 line:95%,end
she has a more ladylike
way of saying it.

00:03:46.292 --> 00:03:48.328 line:95%,end
- Her presentation is easier.
- Yes.

00:03:48.394 --> 00:03:51.097 line:95%,end
So it still goes in one ear
and right out the other. It's fine.

00:03:51.164 --> 00:03:54.067 line:95%,end
But at least she
doesn't come screaming,

00:03:54.133 --> 00:03:56.903 line:95%,end
you know, swearwords at me constantly.


00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.106 line:95%,end
Because Abby's a teacher and I was raised
to respect a teacher.

00:04:00.173 --> 00:04:02.008 line:95%,end
But that doesn't mean
teachers are always perfect.

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:03.643 line:95%,end
I was never perfect as a teacher.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.446 line:95%,end
And I think one of the things
I was disappointed this summer

00:04:06.512 --> 00:04:10.516 line:95%,end
was that Abby-- Although she did
great things professionally on her own,

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:11.985 line:95%,end
the children missed her.

00:04:12.051 --> 00:04:15.121 line:95%,end
Do you think she got a big head
from being photographed in the tabloids?

00:04:15.188 --> 00:04:19.158 line:95%,end
I think Abby has always had
a pretty big ego.

00:04:19.225 --> 00:04:21.127 line:95%,end
So is the hair.

00:04:21.194 --> 00:04:22.829 line:95%,end
Are ready to take some questions
from the audience?

00:04:22.895 --> 00:04:24.397 line:95%,end
- I'd be happy to.
JEFF: Yes.

00:04:24.464 --> 00:04:28.234 line:95%,end
Hi, Holly. I wanted to ask you which
one of your fellow dance moms

00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:31.271 line:95%,end
has made being the rational one
most difficult for you.

00:04:31.337 --> 00:04:33.373 line:95%,end
Oh, my gosh. Ooh.

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:35.808 line:95%,end
There are times you get caught
up in the emotions

00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:37.510 line:95%,end
and you catch us off guard,

00:04:37.577 --> 00:04:40.046 line:95%,end
and you don't see the best sides
of us at all times.

00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:42.715 line:95%,end
And every one of us, every week I think--

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:45.385 line:95%,end
See, that's her politically correct
answer.

00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:47.720 line:95%,end
- She's not going to give you the name.
- All right, Holly.

00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:50.023 line:95%,end
Thank you so much for taking
your turn in the hot seat.

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:51.891 line:95%,end
Thank you, everyone. Thank you.

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.960 line:95%,end
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

00:04:57.664 --> 00:04:58.798 line:95%,end
All right.
Well, I've got a question for you.

00:04:58.865 --> 00:05:00.967 line:95%,end
You're not the only one
who's been out and about.

00:05:01.034 --> 00:05:03.703 line:95%,end
Because the dance moms
have been out with their kids

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.439 line:95%,end
doing what's called meet and greets
without you.

00:05:06.506 --> 00:05:07.440 line:95%,end
- Yes.
- And I understand--

00:05:07.507 --> 00:05:10.376 line:95%,end
I don't know if it's so much
without me or behind my back.

00:05:10.443 --> 00:05:12.445 line:95%,end
[GROANS]

00:05:12.512 --> 00:05:14.247 line:95%,end
Let me explain with a meet and greet is
because

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:16.349 line:95%,end
I don't think they really know.

00:05:16.416 --> 00:05:19.986 line:95%,end
After you've purchased a ticket
to the show and you come and see it,

00:05:20.053 --> 00:05:23.523 line:95%,end
you come to the stage door
and the cast comes out

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:28.428 line:95%,end
and meets you, says hello,
takes pictures with you for free.

00:05:28.494 --> 00:05:29.829 line:95%,end
That's what a meet and greet is.

00:05:29.896 --> 00:05:31.831 line:95%,end
So what have the moms been doing
that's so much different?

00:05:31.898 --> 00:05:34.000 line:95%,end
- They're selling their children.
- Really?

00:05:34.067 --> 00:05:35.268 line:95%,end
Yes. It's like the zoo.

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:37.203 line:95%,end
You know how you pay money
and you go in the zoo

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.872 line:95%,end
and you watch them in a cage?
You take a picture of the animal.

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:41.007 line:95%,end
That's kind of how it is.

00:05:41.074 --> 00:05:43.009 line:95%,end
What's wrong with them making
a few bucks?

00:05:43.076 --> 00:05:44.744 line:95%,end
They're already making a few bucks.

00:05:44.811 --> 00:05:46.079 line:95%,end
Kelly's never had a job in her life.

00:05:46.145 --> 00:05:48.081 line:95%,end
I think she worked at the
Clinique counter for two weeks.

00:05:49.315 --> 00:05:51.250 line:95%,end
We've got a few more
questions from the audience.

00:05:51.317 --> 00:05:52.952 line:95%,end
Yes, ma'am.

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:55.421 line:95%,end
Abby, you have attacked Kelly
multiple times on the blog

00:05:55.488 --> 00:05:57.357 line:95%,end
saying that you wish
she'd leave your studio.

00:05:57.423 --> 00:05:59.225 line:95%,end
- Do you still feel that way, and why?
- Yes.

00:05:59.292 --> 00:06:01.160 line:95%,end
I think that I'm never
going to please Kelly.

00:06:01.227 --> 00:06:04.197 line:95%,end
And I think she wants her kids
to be mediocre.

00:06:04.263 --> 00:06:06.299 line:95%,end
Her kids have been
blessed with a talent.

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:08.468 line:95%,end
And I think for them
not to use that talent

00:06:08.534 --> 00:06:11.070 line:95%,end
and not to pursue it is very wasteful.

00:06:11.137 --> 00:06:12.905 line:95%,end
And I don't agree with her parenting.

00:06:12.972 --> 00:06:14.173 line:95%,end
One last question for Abby.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.842 line:95%,end
They say you wrote the editor

00:06:15.908 --> 00:06:17.944 line:95%,end
saying that Christi was pimping
out Chloe.

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.612 line:95%,end
- Did you write this letter?
- Yes.

00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:20.713 line:95%,end
AUDIENCE MEMBER:
Why do you feel that way?

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.949 line:95%,end
I think Chloe needs to be in dance class,

00:06:23.015 --> 00:06:27.053 line:95%,end
not having a spa treatment
with some kid for 85 bucks.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.422 line:95%,end
JEFF: All right. Let's find out
what Christi has to say.

00:06:30.022 --> 00:06:31.491 line:95%,end
You guys ready for Christi?

00:06:31.557 --> 00:06:33.559 line:95%,end
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

00:06:38.264 --> 00:06:42.201 line:95%,end
So, Christi, how do you really feel
about Abby?

00:06:42.268 --> 00:06:45.037 line:95%,end
Well, I'm not surprised
that Abby said the things she said

00:06:45.104 --> 00:06:47.607 line:95%,end
because Abby makes things up
in her own mind.

00:06:47.673 --> 00:06:50.676 line:95%,end
She doesn't bother to find out
the truth and ask questions.

00:06:50.743 --> 00:06:52.812 line:95%,end
So that's her perception of reality.

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:55.615 line:95%,end
And the reality that we know
is completely different.

00:06:55.681 --> 00:06:57.984 line:95%,end
We could sit here
and explain it to Abby all day,

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:01.521 line:95%,end
but it's not going to change
her opinion of what is true.

00:07:01.587 --> 00:07:05.258 line:95%,end
Because in her mind she is God.
And she tells us every day.

00:07:05.324 --> 00:07:09.429 line:95%,end
So is it true over the break you guys were
out doing lots of meet and greets?

00:07:09.495 --> 00:07:11.330 line:95%,end
Let me explain a few things
about the meet and greets.

00:07:11.397 --> 00:07:13.599 line:95%,end
You know, Abby has one
perception of what a meet and greet is.

00:07:13.666 --> 00:07:15.101 line:95%,end
- No. I know what a meet and greet is.
- No.

00:07:15.168 --> 00:07:16.702 line:95%,end
You know what your version
of a meet and greet is.

00:07:16.769 --> 00:07:18.271 line:95%,end
That is the real version
of a meet and greet.

00:07:18.337 --> 00:07:20.506 line:95%,end
No. It's my turn. Quiet.

00:07:20.573 --> 00:07:22.141 line:95%,end
Contrary to what Abby believes,

00:07:22.208 --> 00:07:25.111 line:95%,end
the children are really
who America wants to see, not her.

00:07:25.178 --> 00:07:27.580 line:95%,end
And so we were taking our
children out to these meet and greets,

00:07:27.647 --> 00:07:31.884 line:95%,end
and 5,000, 6,000 people were showing up.
It was an unsafe environment.

00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:35.421 line:95%,end
We started doing a ticketed event,
where somebody had a ticket.

00:07:35.488 --> 00:07:37.757 line:95%,end
- And what Abby has been--
- Somebody buys a ticket.

00:07:37.824 --> 00:07:39.192 line:95%,end
- Yes. Somebody buys a ticket.
- Clear that up.

00:07:39.258 --> 00:07:41.727 line:95%,end
But let's explain
what the money is going to, Abby.

00:07:41.794 --> 00:07:44.197 line:95%,end
Okay, the money is going
to paying for security.

00:07:44.263 --> 00:07:46.299 line:95%,end
The hair, the shoes.
- Excuse me.

00:07:46.365 --> 00:07:49.068 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: People want to see our kids.
So you know what?

00:07:49.135 --> 00:07:52.438 line:95%,end
She was off in LA, you know, being a star.


00:07:52.505 --> 00:07:54.407 line:95%,end
- All right.
- Wait a minute! Wait a minute.

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:56.042 line:95%,end
How dare you?
JEFF: okay.

00:07:56.108 --> 00:07:59.111 line:95%,end
I have a woman sitting right up there
that was at a dinner party with me

00:07:59.178 --> 00:08:02.682 line:95%,end
when somebody walked over and said,
"Abby, are you feeling better?"

00:08:02.748 --> 00:08:04.083 line:95%,end
And I said, "What are you talking about?"

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:05.785 line:95%,end
She said, "We went to a meet and greet

00:08:05.852 --> 00:08:09.755 line:95%,end
and Christi announced to everyone
that you were ill,

00:08:09.822 --> 00:08:11.891 line:95%,end
and you were in your room
and you couldn't participate."

00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.860 line:95%,end
- That's a complete lie. I never said--
- No, it's not.

00:08:13.926 --> 00:08:16.195 line:95%,end
No, it is, Abby. Again, you're making
things up in your own head.

00:08:16.262 --> 00:08:19.332 line:95%,end
Because I don't talk about you in my meet
and greets because you are nothing!

00:08:20.399 --> 00:08:23.970 line:95%,end
All right, guys. So, Christi.
Take a breath. Take a deep breath.

00:08:24.036 --> 00:08:26.772 line:95%,end
- Oh, she's really upset.
- I know she is.

00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:28.574 line:95%,end
- It's your turn to be in the hot seat.
- Yeah.

00:08:28.641 --> 00:08:31.511 line:95%,end
So who is first up asking
a question for Christ?

00:08:31.577 --> 00:08:34.714 line:95%,end
Hi, I noticed that you blocked Abby
from your Twitter feed. Why?

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:36.215 line:95%,end
Yes. Wouldn't you block that?

00:08:36.282 --> 00:08:38.384 line:95%,end
Because I deal with
her comments every day.

00:08:38.451 --> 00:08:40.553 line:95%,end
I don't want to go home at night
and listen to her comments online.

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.655 line:95%,end
Because she was obsessed
with my Twitter for a while.

00:08:42.722 --> 00:08:44.690 line:95%,end
Everything I would Tweed,
she would comment on.

00:08:44.757 --> 00:08:45.925 line:95%,end
- I don't want to deal with it.
- All right.

00:08:45.992 --> 00:08:48.261 line:95%,end
Who else has a question for Christi?
Sir.

00:08:48.327 --> 00:08:51.097 line:95%,end
You said on the show that your husband

00:08:51.163 --> 00:08:55.668 line:95%,end
referred to Abby's studio
as the Antichrist of childhood.

00:08:55.735 --> 00:08:57.303 line:95%,end
- Yes.
- Why did he say that?

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.038 line:95%,end
And what does he think of the show?

00:08:59.105 --> 00:09:01.874 line:95%,end
My husband thinks that
everything that she stands for--

00:09:01.941 --> 00:09:04.176 line:95%,end
And Abby hates my husband.
I will be the first to say it.

00:09:04.243 --> 00:09:07.780 line:95%,end
She hates him because he told her that
she is too nonsensical to even talk to.

00:09:07.847 --> 00:09:08.781 line:95%,end
And that really struck a chord.

00:09:08.848 --> 00:09:10.449 line:95%,end
No, I hate him because he
doesn't support your child

00:09:10.516 --> 00:09:12.351 line:95%,end
or come and watch her dance, ever.

00:09:12.418 --> 00:09:15.221 line:95%,end
And he showed up in Las Vegas
at a black tie banquet

00:09:15.288 --> 00:09:16.489 line:95%,end
with a pair of shorts and flip-flops on.

00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:18.558 line:95%,end
My husband never came to that banquet.
She's making things up.

00:09:18.624 --> 00:09:20.927 line:95%,end
He sat outside because he
was too cheap to buy a ticket to walk in!

00:09:20.993 --> 00:09:22.662 line:95%,end
You're full of [BLEEP], Abby.

00:09:22.728 --> 00:09:24.830 line:95%,end
You know nothing
of what you're talking about.

00:09:24.897 --> 00:09:29.068 line:95%,end
How much money in the world would it take

00:09:29.135 --> 00:09:33.172 line:95%,end
to send your kid back to someplace
that you felt that way about?

00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:37.410 line:95%,end
Huh? If it feel--
If he feels that strongly--

00:09:37.476 --> 00:09:39.979 line:95%,end
If my dad felt that strongly,
I wouldn't be back there.

00:09:40.046 --> 00:09:43.683 line:95%,end
You're perfect and everybody else
is stupid and not perfect.

00:09:43.749 --> 00:09:45.618 line:95%,end
All right. So the next dance mom
were about to bring out

00:09:45.685 --> 00:09:48.220 line:95%,end
has a 30-year history with Abby.

00:09:48.287 --> 00:09:50.656 line:95%,end
Question on everyone's mind,
including my own--

00:09:50.723 --> 00:09:54.293 line:95%,end
is she staying at the Abby Lee
Dance Studio or is she going?

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.828 line:95%,end
Kelly, come on out.

00:09:55.895 --> 00:09:57.897 line:95%,end
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.703 line:95%,end
Kelly. How are you?
KELLY: Yes? I'm fine, thank you.

00:10:03.769 --> 00:10:04.971 line:95%,end
JEFF: It's great to see you.
- You, too.

00:10:05.037 --> 00:10:08.507 line:95%,end
All right, Kelly. We ended last season
and you were very, very angry.

00:10:08.574 --> 00:10:10.509 line:95%,end
We didn't know
if you were coming back.

00:10:10.576 --> 00:10:13.179 line:95%,end
Would you really leave
the Abby Lee Dance Studio?

00:10:13.245 --> 00:10:16.782 line:95%,end
As a mom I just feel like
I'm taking my kids there

00:10:16.849 --> 00:10:20.019 line:95%,end
for an extracurricular activity
to get their spirits broke.

00:10:20.086 --> 00:10:23.222 line:95%,end
For the past 42 weeks,
my kid has been shown bad.

00:10:23.289 --> 00:10:25.658 line:95%,end
- What do you have to say about that?
- Like, they look at me like I'm crazy.

00:10:25.725 --> 00:10:30.029 line:95%,end
Because I flip out. But, like,
how much do you think I can take?

00:10:30.096 --> 00:10:33.366 line:95%,end
JEFF: So, Abby, do you feel like that's
an accurate answer? Do you buy that?

00:10:33.432 --> 00:10:35.968 line:95%,end
You know, it's hard to give you
a quick little short answer.

00:10:36.035 --> 00:10:37.703 line:95%,end
It's 30 years of history.

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:41.607 line:95%,end
I think Kelly was pretty, she was tall,

00:10:41.674 --> 00:10:45.111 line:95%,end
she had a mom and dad who didn't butt in.

00:10:45.177 --> 00:10:48.014 line:95%,end
And I think she could have done something
with her dancing

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.783 line:95%,end
besides work at the mall, get married,
have two kids.

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:53.085 line:95%,end
But she decided
that she wanted to be a mom.

00:10:53.152 --> 00:10:54.053 line:95%,end
- And that's fine.
- So what's wrong with that?

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.921 line:95%,end
So now she has three beautiful children.

00:10:55.988 --> 00:10:58.324 line:95%,end
She brings Brooke to the dance studio,
carries her on her hip

00:10:58.391 --> 00:11:01.794 line:95%,end
till she's nine years old,
and Brooke was a star.

00:11:01.861 --> 00:11:04.430 line:95%,end
Brooke and I have a very close
relationship.

00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:06.899 line:95%,end
And we still get along great,
Brooke and I.

00:11:06.966 --> 00:11:10.002 line:95%,end
If Brooke doesn't want to work
and Brooke wants to work on her academics

00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:12.672 line:95%,end
or this or that or with everything,
I respect that.

00:11:12.738 --> 00:11:15.908 line:95%,end
That's fine and dandy. Don't take a spot
up on the competition team

00:11:15.975 --> 00:11:19.779 line:95%,end
if you want to do other things,
give that spot up

00:11:19.845 --> 00:11:23.783 line:95%,end
and let some young kid that really wants
to do this for a living do it.

00:11:23.849 --> 00:11:25.885 line:95%,end
- All right. Okay, understood.
- And I think that's selfish.

00:11:25.951 --> 00:11:28.921 line:95%,end
So, Kelly, tell us where your
relationship is right now with Christi.

00:11:28.988 --> 00:11:30.456 line:95%,end
What's going on?
How are you guys doing?

00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:35.795 line:95%,end
I think that Melissa and Christi
have started a new jewelry line,

00:11:35.861 --> 00:11:38.698 line:95%,end
and I kind of feel left out of that.

00:11:38.764 --> 00:11:42.068 line:95%,end
- Yeah. Why wasn't it your kid?
- I know nothing about that.


00:11:45.304 --> 00:11:47.139 line:95%,end
So I'm sitting here
with Abby Lee Miller.

00:11:47.206 --> 00:11:50.576 line:95%,end
So, Abby, you've never shied
away from criticizing Chloe.

00:11:50.643 --> 00:11:52.912 line:95%,end
Why are you so critical of Chloe?

00:11:52.978 --> 00:11:54.413 line:95%,end
Because, once again--

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:58.284 line:95%,end
meeting, greeting, selling, jewelry line--

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:01.153 line:95%,end
the poor kid can barely
do a left split anymore.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:03.522 line:95%,end
I have put tons and tons of work
into Chloe.

00:12:03.589 --> 00:12:07.159 line:95%,end
Two years ago, that kid was Junior
Miss Dance of Pennsylvania.

00:12:07.226 --> 00:12:10.196 line:5%,start
She has regressed. It's horrible.

00:12:10.262 --> 00:12:11.764 line:5%,start
My daughter is amazing.

00:12:11.831 --> 00:12:15.901 line:95%,end
She just wants her not to ever have any
opportunities from the show.

00:12:15.968 --> 00:12:17.336 line:95%,end
JILL: She will, and she does.
- But she won't!

00:12:17.403 --> 00:12:19.371 line:95%,end
- If Abby keeps saying that about her.
- You know what?

00:12:19.438 --> 00:12:23.409 line:95%,end
Look what Abby's saying about her kids.
People are going to get it.

00:12:23.476 --> 00:12:26.178 line:95%,end
Hopefully, Chloe is going
to come out here and be strong

00:12:26.245 --> 00:12:28.814 line:95%,end
and wonderful
and do what she knows to do best.

00:12:28.881 --> 00:12:32.585 line:95%,end
All right. Let's welcome Chloe, performing
her national title winning dance,

00:12:32.651 --> 00:12:34.653 line:95%,end
"I Love Only Silence."

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:36.722 line:5%,start
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

00:12:39.925 --> 00:12:44.630 line:5%,start
(SINGING) I love only silence here.

00:12:44.697 --> 00:12:47.233 line:95%,end
There is noise all the time.

00:12:48.934 --> 00:12:52.371 line:95%,end
I love sunny landscapes.

00:12:52.438 --> 00:12:56.175 line:95%,end
I love the sky.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:02.748 line:95%,end
Pale blue, pale pink
or a calm white--

00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:09.488 line:95%,end
Here the buildings are so high.

00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:16.729 line:95%,end
Pale blue, pale pink or a calm white--

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:25.237 line:95%,end
here the buildings are so high
that one sees nothing.

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:42.021 line:95%,end
Oh, if I-- oh, if I-- if I
could rise up and

00:13:42.087 --> 00:13:44.723 line:95%,end
annihilate all those ambitious countries.

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:48.327 line:95%,end
Oh, if I-- oh, if I-- if I
could rise up and

00:13:48.394 --> 00:13:51.197 line:95%,end
annihilate all those ambitious countries.

00:13:51.263 --> 00:13:58.270 line:95%,end
I await the great
woman who will save.

00:13:58.671 --> 00:14:05.678 line:95%,end
I await the great
woman who will save.

00:14:06.111 --> 00:14:13.118 line:95%,end
I await the great
woman who will save.

00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.960 line:95%,end
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

00:14:24.063 --> 00:14:26.232 line:95%,end
Chloe, that was fantastic.
Absolutely fantastic.

00:14:26.298 --> 00:14:27.900 line:95%,end
Yay! Beautiful.

00:14:27.967 --> 00:14:31.337 line:95%,end
So, Abby, last year we noticed
that there was a shift

00:14:31.403 --> 00:14:33.939 line:95%,end
about to happen between you and Melissa.

00:14:34.006 --> 00:14:36.375 line:95%,end
Melissa gets close to people very quickly.

00:14:36.442 --> 00:14:39.345 line:95%,end
I should have been smarter.
I should have been guarded.

00:14:39.411 --> 00:14:42.581 line:95%,end
We've got a few more questions from
the audience on the subject of Melissa.

00:14:42.648 --> 00:14:45.084 line:95%,end
So who's got a question for Abby?

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:48.053 line:95%,end
Hi, Abby. Now that Melissa
doesn't work at the desk,

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.822 line:95%,end
do you still give Maddie
special treatment?

00:14:49.889 --> 00:14:52.591 line:95%,end
First of all, Maddie never
received special treatment

00:14:52.658 --> 00:14:54.293 line:95%,end
because Melissa worked at the desk.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.529 line:95%,end
Maddie received special treatment
because Maddie's a special kid.


00:14:57.596 --> 00:15:01.834 line:95%,end
She was on time. She was prepared.
She was well rehearsed.

00:15:01.901 --> 00:15:05.170 line:95%,end
That kid walked into the studio
and she was a sponge.

00:15:05.237 --> 00:15:09.008 line:95%,end
Those were open to every child.
She's the one that took advantage of them.

00:15:09.074 --> 00:15:11.310 line:95%,end
Now, I know that you have
every intention in the world

00:15:11.377 --> 00:15:13.178 line:95%,end
of turning Maddie into a star.

00:15:13.245 --> 00:15:15.714 line:95%,end
- I want a whole studio full of stars.
- I know, but Maddie in particular.

00:15:15.781 --> 00:15:18.250 line:95%,end
A dream is for your choreography

00:15:18.317 --> 00:15:21.553 line:95%,end
to look better than you ever imagined,
and Maddie does that.

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:23.756 line:95%,end
She takes it and she makes it her own.

00:15:23.822 --> 00:15:25.858 line:95%,end
- Not too many kids do that.
- All right.

00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:28.294 line:95%,end
Let's see who else has a question for you.
Yes?

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:32.965 line:95%,end
I was wondering currently, is Melissa's
loyalty to you or the other moms?

00:15:33.032 --> 00:15:35.434 line:95%,end
Her loyalty is definitely
to the other moms.

00:15:35.501 --> 00:15:38.070 line:95%,end
What do you mean that her loyalty
is with the moms instead of you?

00:15:38.137 --> 00:15:41.941 line:95%,end
Melissa is a great dance mom.
She's there, she helps all the children.

00:15:42.007 --> 00:15:44.910 line:95%,end
She's even paid for other kids lessons
who couldn't afford it.

00:15:44.977 --> 00:15:47.646 line:95%,end
So now it's become more important

00:15:47.713 --> 00:15:52.184 line:95%,end
for her to be friends and chums
with the girlfriends

00:15:52.251 --> 00:15:55.721 line:95%,end
than it is to be a good mom for Maddie.

00:15:55.788 --> 00:15:58.490 line:95%,end
Who defines what a good mom is?

00:15:58.557 --> 00:16:01.126 line:95%,end
You know what? You know what I think
the definition of a good mom is?

00:16:01.193 --> 00:16:04.363 line:95%,end
The way your child is. And Maddie's
a good kid, so you're a great mom.

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:06.198 line:95%,end
- Thank you, Christi.
- She's a [BLEEP].

00:16:06.265 --> 00:16:10.002 line:95%,end
When you put your kids second and
your girlfriend's first, that's a problem.

00:16:10.069 --> 00:16:12.271 line:95%,end
All right. Before you say too much more,
why don't we just bring Melissa out

00:16:12.338 --> 00:16:13.138 line:95%,end
and find out what she has to say?

00:16:13.205 --> 00:16:14.840 line:95%,end
Sure. Bring her out.

00:16:14.907 --> 00:16:18.844 line:95%,end
Please, Melissa,
don't you sit there and cower to her.

00:16:18.911 --> 00:16:20.713 line:95%,end
Stand up for yourself.

00:16:20.779 --> 00:16:22.781 line:95%,end
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

00:16:27.152 --> 00:16:28.887 line:95%,end
- Hi, Melissa. Thanks for coming.
- Thank you.

00:16:28.954 --> 00:16:31.857 line:95%,end
It's really good to see you.
All right, so let's just cut to the chase.

00:16:31.924 --> 00:16:36.061 line:95%,end
Are you closer with the moms now or are
you still as close as you were to Abby?

00:16:36.128 --> 00:16:41.233 line:95%,end
I am closer to the moms.
And, you know, it makes my life easier.

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:44.036 line:95%,end
Because I would go home at night
and Maddie goes, Mom,

00:16:44.103 --> 00:16:46.338 line:95%,end
why didn't the moms ask you
to go to dinner with them?

00:16:46.405 --> 00:16:49.708 line:95%,end
Why are you always sitting by yourself?
And it hurts my kids.

00:16:49.775 --> 00:16:51.810 line:95%,end
Are you ready to take some questions
from the audience?

00:16:51.877 --> 00:16:55.080 line:95%,end
All right. So who has a question
for Melissa? Yes.

00:16:55.147 --> 00:16:59.752 line:95%,end
Hi, Melissa. I was wondering-- do you have
any fears about this upcoming season?

00:16:59.818 --> 00:17:04.423 line:95%,end
And is there anything that can happen
that you might be afraid of?

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:06.525 line:95%,end
One of my biggest fears--

00:17:06.592 --> 00:17:10.162 line:95%,end
I actually dream about this at night,
is Mackenzie getting hurt.

00:17:10.229 --> 00:17:14.299 line:95%,end
But if she has her arms by her ears
and does it correctly, she won't get hurt.

00:17:14.366 --> 00:17:16.702 line:95%,end
But if she doesn't listen,
she might get hurt.

00:17:16.769 --> 00:17:18.804 line:95%,end
And she doesn't listen
quite like Maddie does.

00:17:18.871 --> 00:17:21.573 line:95%,end
- Mackenzie's her own little self.
- All right.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.675 line:95%,end
Well, god forbid, we don't want anything
to happen to Mackenzie.

00:17:23.742 --> 00:17:26.879 line:95%,end
- So who has a question for Melissa?
- Hi, Melissa.

00:17:26.945 --> 00:17:28.914 line:95%,end
Will you get married on the show?

00:17:28.981 --> 00:17:30.983 line:95%,end
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

00:17:32.017 --> 00:17:34.720 line:95%,end
Would you guys like to see
Melissa get married on the show?

00:17:34.787 --> 00:17:36.789 line:95%,end
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

00:17:37.923 --> 00:17:42.294 line:95%,end
Could you-- I mean, can you imagine
how perfect that would be,

00:17:42.361 --> 00:17:45.597 line:95%,end
seeing Maddie and Mackenzie walk down
the aisle standing next to their mother?

00:17:45.664 --> 00:17:47.766 line:95%,end
It would be a lovely thing.
So, come on, Melissa.

00:17:47.833 --> 00:17:51.170 line:95%,end
- Are you gonna get married on the show?
- I don't know.

00:17:51.236 --> 00:17:53.238 line:95%,end
I'm going to get married pretty soon,
hopefully.

00:17:53.305 --> 00:17:55.240 line:95%,end
- And, woo, how about that bridal party?
- One more time.

00:17:55.307 --> 00:17:57.076 line:95%,end
One more time, come on.

00:17:57.142 --> 00:17:59.144 line:95%,end
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:03.816 line:95%,end
Yup. That's gonna be one drunk reception.


00:18:05.984 --> 00:18:09.555 line:95%,end
So our next answer got a standing ovation
the last time she did this number.

00:18:09.621 --> 00:18:13.325 line:95%,end
So let's give it up for Nia performing
"Working Girl."

00:18:13.392 --> 00:18:15.527 line:95%,end
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:31.743 --> 00:18:34.179 line:95%,end
(SINGING) Hi. I heard y'all was hiring.

00:18:34.246 --> 00:18:35.881 line:95%,end
Yeah. You see, my name is Laquifa.

00:18:35.948 --> 00:18:37.649 line:95%,end
Can you see this tattoo
right here on my chest?

00:18:37.716 --> 00:18:40.519 line:95%,end
I get my credentials
from the street, baby.

00:18:42.087 --> 00:18:45.557 line:95%,end
Clock the hair. Clock the hair.
Clock the mug. Clock the mug.

00:18:45.624 --> 00:18:48.961 line:95%,end
Clock the nails, clock my skirt.
You better get into to it.

00:18:49.027 --> 00:18:52.364 line:95%,end
Clock the bag. Clock the bag.
Clock the shoes. Clock the shoes.

00:18:52.431 --> 00:18:55.901 line:95%,end
Now punch the clock.
It's time to work.

00:18:55.968 --> 00:18:59.171 line:95%,end
Move over, amateurs,
taking mine, taking yours.

00:18:59.238 --> 00:19:02.474 line:95%,end
Uh, someone better hold my purse.
Mm-hmm.

00:19:02.541 --> 00:19:06.812 line:95%,end
Figure it out like Nancy Drew.
Catch on quick like hallelu.

00:19:06.879 --> 00:19:10.048 line:95%,end
Come on, check me, boo.
Not you. I'm a pro.

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:14.219 line:95%,end
Pro. I'm a pro.

00:19:14.286 --> 00:19:17.856 line:95%,end
Uh, I am a professional pro.

00:19:17.923 --> 00:19:21.393 line:95%,end
I'm a pro. I'm a pro.

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:24.463 line:95%,end
I am a professional. Work.

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:27.866 line:95%,end
I came to work. Uh-huh.
I came to work.

00:19:27.933 --> 00:19:31.537 line:95%,end
I told y'all I was a professional.
Work. Uh-huh.

00:19:31.603 --> 00:19:34.339 line:95%,end
I came to work. I came to work.

00:19:34.406 --> 00:19:39.111 line:95%,end
Uh-huh.
See, I am a professional. yes.

00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:41.180 line:95%,end
Haters cannot touch my drive.

00:19:41.246 --> 00:19:44.283 line:95%,end
References? I'm a pro.

00:19:44.349 --> 00:19:47.286 line:95%,end
Pro. I'm a pro.

00:19:47.352 --> 00:19:51.790 line:95%,end
I am a professional pro.
What? I'm a pro.

00:19:51.857 --> 00:19:54.826 line:95%,end
What? I came to work. Uh-huh.
Can you see my badge?

00:19:54.893 --> 00:19:58.063 line:95%,end
I am a professional

00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:00.265 line:95%,end
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

00:20:00.332 --> 00:20:03.001 line:95%,end
It was good. I couldn't see all of it.

00:20:03.068 --> 00:20:06.605 line:5%,start
It's, like, high energy. Nia does well
with high energy, I think.

00:20:07.406 --> 00:20:09.141 line:95%,end
That was fantastic.

00:20:10.175 --> 00:20:11.777 line:95%,end
So, Abby, let's talk Jill.

00:20:11.843 --> 00:20:15.314 line:95%,end
So I heard that recently
Jill has been doing a lot

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:17.749 line:95%,end
to try to get in your good graces.

00:20:17.816 --> 00:20:19.551 line:95%,end
Yes. Jill's a good customer.

00:20:19.618 --> 00:20:21.887 line:95%,end
She pays her bills on time.
She does what she's supposed to.

00:20:21.954 --> 00:20:24.489 line:95%,end
So is she trying to work her way
to the top of the mom pyramid

00:20:24.556 --> 00:20:25.958 line:95%,end
to become your favorite mom?

00:20:26.024 --> 00:20:29.561 line:95%,end
I think she wouldn't mind filling the void
that Melissa left.

00:20:29.628 --> 00:20:31.196 line:95%,end
- Seems like it.
- Mm-hmm.

00:20:31.263 --> 00:20:33.865 line:95%,end
So because Kendall
has been at the studio,

00:20:33.932 --> 00:20:37.035 line:95%,end
what should we expect to see
from her this upcoming season?

00:20:37.102 --> 00:20:40.706 line:95%,end
While the other kids are stagnating,
Kendall is improving.

00:20:40.772 --> 00:20:44.743 line:95%,end
Kendall is only nine years old,
so you have to keep that into perspective.

00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:47.479 line:95%,end
She is a beautiful child.

00:20:47.546 --> 00:20:50.949 line:95%,end
So I think we're going to see
Kendall kind of break out of her shell

00:20:51.016 --> 00:20:53.585 line:95%,end
and maybe move on up that pyramid.

00:20:53.652 --> 00:20:56.588 line:95%,end
All right. So the one thing I can
say about our next guest

00:20:56.655 --> 00:20:58.690 line:95%,end
is she's unpredictable.

00:20:58.757 --> 00:21:00.259 line:95%,end
She's sometimes provocative.

00:21:00.325 --> 00:21:03.695 line:95%,end
And every time I see her she's got
a new hairdo and a new dress on.

00:21:03.762 --> 00:21:06.098 line:95%,end
- Let's meet Jill.
- Am I supposed to be down there?

00:21:06.164 --> 00:21:08.533 line:95%,end
- Be the bitchy Jill.
- Yeah. It takes a while.

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:09.668 line:95%,end
- Be the bitchy Jill.
- Look at me.

00:21:09.735 --> 00:21:13.372 line:95%,end
I'm a total wrinkled mess
and I hate my hair today.

00:21:13.438 --> 00:21:15.941 line:95%,end
Well, you could change the hair color
on your way down.

00:21:16.008 --> 00:21:17.743 line:95%,end
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:17.809 --> 00:21:20.779 line:95%,end
You change that as much
as you change studios!

00:21:20.846 --> 00:21:22.848 line:95%,end
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

00:21:25.951 --> 00:21:29.021 line:95%,end
- It's me. I'm good. It's good to see you.
- How are you?

00:21:29.087 --> 00:21:32.257 line:95%,end
See, I told you, she always has
a new dress and a new hairdo.

00:21:32.324 --> 00:21:34.326 line:95%,end
I know, and it's not a good hair day,
I'm just saying.

00:21:34.393 --> 00:21:36.528 line:95%,end
All right, so let's cut right to the
chase.

00:21:36.595 --> 00:21:39.831 line:95%,end
Why are you trying so hard to
become Abby's new favorite mom?

00:21:39.898 --> 00:21:42.901 line:95%,end
This is who I am. I'm a dance mom.

00:21:42.968 --> 00:21:46.004 line:95%,end
And my goal is to get
the best for my children.

00:21:46.071 --> 00:21:49.975 line:95%,end
When I first met Abby she said,
"I am the best for your children.

00:21:50.042 --> 00:21:54.346 line:95%,end
Bring them to me, I'll make them stars.
I'll do what I can for them."

00:21:54.413 --> 00:21:59.418 line:95%,end
And so far, she has. Now, her delivery
sometimes is a little rough.

00:21:59.484 --> 00:22:01.853 line:95%,end
And we've had-- you know,
it gets a little volatile.

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:06.391 line:95%,end
But I was really pleased to hear you say
how you have seen Kendall grow.

00:22:06.458 --> 00:22:07.893 line:95%,end
I needed Abby to see that.

00:22:07.959 --> 00:22:10.829 line:95%,end
And I think it took a while,
maybe a whole season,


00:22:10.896 --> 00:22:14.966 line:95%,end
for her to realize
Kendall really has a lot of potential.

00:22:15.033 --> 00:22:18.170 line:95%,end
So because Kendall was in class--
kudos to you. Good girl.

00:22:18.236 --> 00:22:21.239 line:95%,end
Well, she wants to be there, though.
I mean, she wants to dance.

00:22:21.306 --> 00:22:22.874 line:95%,end
But it take-- you know-- It takes two.

00:22:22.941 --> 00:22:27.479 line:95%,end
So she just said that those other kids
don't really want to be there.

00:22:27.546 --> 00:22:29.181 line:95%,end
- That's what I heard.
JILL: Did I say--

00:22:29.247 --> 00:22:30.849 line:95%,end
JEFF: All right. Back to--
so back to Kendall.

00:22:30.916 --> 00:22:33.452 line:95%,end
Where do you expect to see Kendall
on that pyramid this season?

00:22:33.518 --> 00:22:35.320 line:5%,start
At the top.

00:22:35.387 --> 00:22:38.423 line:5%,start
Okay. But the whole time that Kendall's
in class,

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:41.460 line:95%,end
Jill's visiting mommy at Candy Apples.

00:22:41.526 --> 00:22:42.928 line:95%,end
Jill's a studio hopper.

00:22:42.994 --> 00:22:46.298 line:95%,end
I think every kid in there--
correct me if I'm wrong--

00:22:46.365 --> 00:22:49.634 line:95%,end
have been at the top of that pyramid
except one, Kendall.

00:22:49.701 --> 00:22:51.536 line:95%,end
JEFF: All right. Well, let's hope
that happens this season.

00:22:51.603 --> 00:22:54.740 line:95%,end
JEFF: So, Jill, everybody's taken their
turn in the hot seat. It's your turn.

00:22:54.806 --> 00:22:58.443 line:95%,end
- I know.
- So who has a question for Jill?

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:04.182 line:95%,end
Hi, Jill. Kendall beat Chloe at one of
the competitions prior to Nationals.

00:23:04.249 --> 00:23:07.018 line:95%,end
So why was she able to compete
during Nationals?

00:23:07.085 --> 00:23:10.822 line:95%,end
That's a good question, before Nationals,

00:23:10.889 --> 00:23:12.891 line:95%,end
the plan was you had solo week.

00:23:12.958 --> 00:23:17.028 line:95%,end
Whoever did well that week
got the solo for Nationals.

00:23:17.095 --> 00:23:20.031 line:95%,end
And Kendall, as you know,
had beaten Chloe.

00:23:20.098 --> 00:23:22.300 line:95%,end
She should have had the solo,
and she didn't get it.

00:23:22.367 --> 00:23:25.303 line:95%,end
All right, so let's take one more question
who else has a question for Jill?

00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:29.341 line:95%,end
Hi, Jill. On the show you state how much
money spent on counseling.

00:23:29.408 --> 00:23:31.943 line:95%,end
Would you suggest that
for any other dance moms?

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:35.247 line:95%,end
Well, actually, it--
it was kind of a joke.

00:23:35.313 --> 00:23:38.150 line:95%,end
I really don't send my kid to counseling.

00:23:38.216 --> 00:23:41.420 line:95%,end
- Hey. Dance class is cheaper than rehab.
JILL: Than rehab.

00:23:42.654 --> 00:23:45.924 line:95%,end
These questions have been way too easy.
You ready for one more?

00:23:45.991 --> 00:23:47.659 line:95%,end
All right, come on.
Somebody ask a tough one.

00:23:47.726 --> 00:23:51.062 line:95%,end
Hi, Jill. The bloggers are obsessed
with your many looks on the show.

00:23:51.129 --> 00:23:54.166 line:95%,end
Well, those many looks go
with those many personalities.

00:23:54.232 --> 00:23:57.869 line:95%,end
I was just curious--
have you had any work done?

00:23:57.936 --> 00:24:01.206 line:95%,end
- Well, I-- I know. Wow.
- Whoa! Whoa.

00:24:01.273 --> 00:24:04.609 line:95%,end
I have not had surgery.

00:24:04.676 --> 00:24:07.946 line:95%,end
And if I did, I wouldn't look like this.
I'd look amazing.

00:24:08.013 --> 00:24:12.083 line:95%,end
You know, just your typical--
and I think all the moms on the show

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:13.985 line:95%,end
have had some Botox and filler.

00:24:14.052 --> 00:24:16.121 line:95%,end
Yeah. We talk about it. I mean--

00:24:17.322 --> 00:24:18.190 line:95%,end
I'm not a mom.

00:24:18.256 --> 00:24:20.225 line:95%,end
All right, so I've got a question
for Abby.

00:24:20.292 --> 00:24:23.495 line:95%,end
So, Abby, what's going on between
you and Cathy right now?

00:24:23.562 --> 00:24:26.298 line:95%,end
I don't-- is she still eating my dust?
I don't know.

00:24:26.364 --> 00:24:29.234 line:95%,end
We went to Nationals. We won.

00:24:29.301 --> 00:24:33.705 line:95%,end
She conceded. She said, hey,
the number was excellent.

00:24:33.772 --> 00:24:38.310 line:95%,end
She walked out. Frankly,
I thought I'd never see her again.

00:24:38.376 --> 00:24:39.544 line:95%,end
JEFF: And then what happened?

00:24:39.611 --> 00:24:41.780 line:95%,end
Well, you invited her to come on the show.

00:24:43.048 --> 00:24:44.850 line:95%,end
That's for sure, I did.

00:24:44.916 --> 00:24:48.854 line:95%,end
So our next guest is someone I like to
call the Sue Sylvester of "Dance Moms."

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:50.956 line:95%,end
She burns up the blogs
when she's on the show.

00:24:51.022 --> 00:24:53.558 line:95%,end
She's our favorite little Candy Apple.

00:24:53.625 --> 00:24:56.895 line:95%,end
All the way from Canton, Ohio,
it's time for Cathy.

00:24:56.962 --> 00:24:58.964 line:95%,end

JEFF: Razzle dazzle.
- Having a bad hair day, honey.

00:25:11.309 --> 00:25:14.045 line:95%,end
- So are you.
- You're having a bad hair day.

00:25:14.112 --> 00:25:16.882 line:95%,end
I hate the bitch. I hate her.

00:25:16.948 --> 00:25:19.484 line:95%,end
JEFF: We've missed you, Cathy.
- You missed me? Oh, good.

00:25:19.551 --> 00:25:21.219 line:95%,end
- Well, I did, anyway.
- I haven't.

00:25:21.286 --> 00:25:22.220 line:95%,end
- I know you haven't.
- So listen.

00:25:22.287 --> 00:25:24.122 line:95%,end
So before we get to it-- so, Cathy,

00:25:24.189 --> 00:25:26.791 line:95%,end
you had a very difficult
competition season last year.

00:25:26.858 --> 00:25:30.862 line:95%,end
And yet you are
determined to beat Abby.

00:25:30.929 --> 00:25:34.399 line:95%,end
And she just said before you came out here
that you were eating her dust.

00:25:34.466 --> 00:25:36.768 line:95%,end
So are you going to beat her this year
or what?

00:25:36.835 --> 00:25:43.308 line:95%,end
Well, there's opportunities for me
to have my group compete against her.

00:25:43.375 --> 00:25:49.047 line:95%,end
But that one single little win
just burned my fire.

00:25:49.114 --> 00:25:53.785 line:95%,end
So it's just made it ignite,
and I got a taste of that victory.

00:25:53.852 --> 00:25:55.554 line:95%,end
You know,
every dog has their day, so--

00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:58.690 line:95%,end
I think she might beat you this year.
What're you going to do she beats you?

00:25:58.757 --> 00:26:02.627 line:95%,end
The way these kids are rehearsing
and missing class

00:26:02.694 --> 00:26:04.729 line:95%,end
and away every weekend
doing that their thing--

00:26:04.796 --> 00:26:07.132 line:95%,end
absolutely she probably can beat me.

00:26:07.198 --> 00:26:08.433 line:95%,end
And don't you love
the way she framed that?

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:10.268 line:95%,end
The way she's gonna beat you because she
has--

00:26:10.335 --> 00:26:13.872 line:95%,end
- Sure. She's got a justifiable excuse.
- --creatively, artistically? No.

00:26:13.939 --> 00:26:14.873 line:95%,end
Oh.


00:26:16.007 --> 00:26:18.910 line:95%,end
I'm here on the stage with Abby, Jill
and Cathy.

00:26:18.977 --> 00:26:21.713 line:95%,end
But first we have another performance,
and it's from the little girl

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:25.183 line:95%,end
that Abby says makes her invincible
when it comes to the competitions.

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:28.353 line:95%,end
So, Abby, I'm going to let you do
the introduction for this one.

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:34.059 line:95%,end
I would love to introduce Maddie
performing "Piece of My Heart."

(SINGING) I wonder if you
ever thought of me

00:26:51.876 --> 00:26:56.214 line:95%,end
and how I'm doing.

00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:02.754 line:95%,end
And I wonder if you ever said,

00:27:02.821 --> 00:27:05.390 line:95%,end
"Gosh, I miss her,

00:27:05.457 --> 00:27:09.728 line:95%,end
and I just threw it away."

00:27:15.433 --> 00:27:18.670 line:95%,end
But it's all right.

00:27:18.737 --> 00:27:25.744 line:95%,end
'Cause you still have
that little piece of my heart.

00:27:28.747 --> 00:27:35.754 line:95%,end
And it's all right 'cause I was strong

00:27:36.521 --> 00:27:39.758 line:95%,end
and I let you go.

00:27:39.824 --> 00:27:44.396 line:95%,end
But you will always have

00:27:44.462 --> 00:27:48.933 line:95%,end
that little piece

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.504 line:95%,end
in my heart.

00:27:57.742 --> 00:28:02.747 line:95%,end
I wonder if you ever
thought of me

00:28:04.382 --> 00:28:09.988 line:95%,end

[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

00:28:24.803 --> 00:28:28.206 line:95%,end
JEFF: Thank you, Maddie.
That was absolutely fantastic.

00:28:28.273 --> 00:28:31.176 line:95%,end
- Cathy, you just saw Maddie perform.
- Mm-hmm.

00:28:31.242 --> 00:28:33.278 line:95%,end
Tell us your professional opinion.

00:28:33.344 --> 00:28:36.514 line:95%,end
I definitely think that Maddie
is a natural talent.

00:28:36.581 --> 00:28:39.084 line:95%,end
There's no doubt about that.
But, you know, I just think that Abby

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:40.785 line:95%,end
puts a lot of stock in Maddie.

00:28:40.852 --> 00:28:44.255 line:95%,end
And I think that maybe sometimes she
should look beyond her horizons

00:28:44.322 --> 00:28:46.257 line:95%,end
to other dancers and maybe not--

00:28:46.324 --> 00:28:48.526 line:95%,end
- Do you mean from other studios?
- No, not from other studios.

00:28:48.593 --> 00:28:50.428 line:95%,end
Because that, my dear,
would be soliciting,

00:28:50.495 --> 00:28:52.397 line:95%,end
which you always accuse me of.

00:28:53.398 --> 00:28:54.999 line:95%,end
Not at other dance studios.

00:28:55.066 --> 00:28:57.535 line:95%,end
You have some fine talent
in your own studio

00:28:57.602 --> 00:29:01.873 line:95%,end
that maybe get off the moms
and try to focus more on the kids.

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:04.275 line:5%,start
Cathy, you have never
said anything in the world

00:29:04.342 --> 00:29:06.511 line:5%,start
that I agree with,
and I agree with that.

00:29:06.578 --> 00:29:08.880 line:95%,end
Cathy, everybody's taken
their turn in the hot seat.

00:29:08.947 --> 00:29:10.515 line:95%,end
- It's your turn to be in the hot seat.
- Oh, gosh.

00:29:10.582 --> 00:29:12.751 line:95%,end
JEFF: So who has a question for Cathy?

00:29:13.752 --> 00:29:17.422 line:95%,end
Hi. There's some rumors out there
that Christi

00:29:17.489 --> 00:29:19.858 line:95%,end
choked you at last year's Nationals.

00:29:19.924 --> 00:29:22.327 line:95%,end
- You want me-- you want me to answer?
- That's a hot question.

00:29:22.393 --> 00:29:24.295 line:95%,end
Okay, yes.

00:29:24.362 --> 00:29:26.231 line:95%,end
And I told you you should
have sued the crap out of her.

00:29:26.297 --> 00:29:28.900 line:95%,end
JILL: Yeah, but why,
why did Christi choke you?

00:29:28.967 --> 00:29:30.068 line:95%,end
- Who instigated it?
- Christi-- All right.

00:29:30.135 --> 00:29:31.970 line:95%,end
It was our last competition of the season.

00:29:32.036 --> 00:29:34.272 line:95%,end
- They had just lost badly.
- Okay.

00:29:34.339 --> 00:29:36.441 line:95%,end
- I'll just let her answer.
- Go ahead.

00:29:36.508 --> 00:29:40.044 line:95%,end
The ALDC girls were chanting, you know,

00:29:40.111 --> 00:29:42.313 line:95%,end
rotten apples
and all the apple jokes that we hear.

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:44.949 line:95%,end
We were changing one, two, three, we
are Abby Lee, which we do all the time.

00:29:45.016 --> 00:29:47.986 line:95%,end
- No. No, you were not.
- Outside in front of the theater.

00:29:48.052 --> 00:29:49.387 line:95%,end
ABBY: Yes, we were.
- After we had won.

00:29:49.454 --> 00:29:53.191 line:95%,end
- You were yelling ALDC, ALDC.
- It was a celebratory chant.

00:29:53.258 --> 00:29:56.594 line:95%,end
No, it was not. It was directed
directly to us. Anyhow--

00:29:56.661 --> 00:29:58.596 line:95%,end
Do you want me to answer the question?

00:29:58.663 --> 00:30:00.799 line:95%,end
Then you need to tell these ladies--
Oh, excuse me.

00:30:00.865 --> 00:30:03.501 line:95%,end
You need to tell these broads
to shut up.

00:30:03.568 --> 00:30:07.138 line:95%,end
Okay.
So, anyhow, as I was saying--

00:30:07.205 --> 00:30:08.973 line:95%,end
Do they even use that word,
broad, anymore?


00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:10.842 line:95%,end
- That's, like, from the olden days.
- It's from the 1920s.

00:30:10.909 --> 00:30:13.845 line:95%,end
Well, you're not too far behind me,
and neither are you.

00:30:13.912 --> 00:30:17.749 line:95%,end
Okay. So, anyhow,
Christi was on me, you know,

00:30:17.816 --> 00:30:20.385 line:95%,end
on those sparkly
high heels that she wears.

00:30:21.386 --> 00:30:23.354 line:95%,end
And I had a bottle of water,
and I thought,

00:30:23.421 --> 00:30:26.090 line:95%,end
oh, if she comes near me
it's going on her.

00:30:26.157 --> 00:30:29.194 line:95%,end
Because Sparky needs cooled down.
So I unscrewed the lid--

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:32.397 line:95%,end
Well, you also know when you throw
the water on the witch they melt.

00:30:32.463 --> 00:30:34.399 line:95%,end
You're right. Thank you.
And there she was,

00:30:34.465 --> 00:30:36.434 line:95%,end
and I turned around
and threw the water at her.

00:30:36.501 --> 00:30:39.671 line:95%,end
And then she did this.
You know, if you watch the show,

00:30:39.737 --> 00:30:41.940 line:95%,end
this is always in people's noses.

00:30:42.006 --> 00:30:44.609 line:95%,end
- You know, always in people's noses.
- All right. They get the point.

00:30:44.676 --> 00:30:48.446 line:95%,end
And I slapped her hand away
and she came after me.

00:30:48.513 --> 00:30:51.115 line:95%,end
You wait. I'm going to choke that bitch
when we go out there.

00:30:51.182 --> 00:30:53.685 line:95%,end
[LAUGHS]

00:30:53.751 --> 00:30:55.320 line:95%,end
- I'm kidding.
- I know you are.

00:30:55.386 --> 00:30:56.187 line:95%,end
I'm like, please don't say that.

00:30:56.254 --> 00:30:58.356 line:95%,end
Can you choke Abby instead of Cathy?

00:30:58.423 --> 00:31:00.725 line:95%,end
And I had bruises on my clavicle bone.

00:31:00.792 --> 00:31:04.696 line:95%,end
- Well, she-- you fell off the curb.
- Well, she pushed me off the curb.

00:31:04.762 --> 00:31:07.398 line:95%,end
- But she didn't come after you.
- Yes, she most certainly did.

00:31:07.465 --> 00:31:09.767 line:95%,end
She pushed me right into a tree.

00:31:11.035 --> 00:31:13.538 line:95%,end
I just want to know where were my cameras?

00:31:14.739 --> 00:31:20.211 line:95%,end
But what did they say about her
choreographer who was chastising--

00:31:20.278 --> 00:31:22.347 line:95%,end
KELLY: And swearing at our kids.
- --and swearing at the kids.

00:31:22.413 --> 00:31:25.149 line:95%,end
Who else has a question
for Cathy in the audience?

00:31:25.216 --> 00:31:27.852 line:95%,end
Hi, Cathy. Are we going to see
Vivi dance again?

00:31:27.919 --> 00:31:30.622 line:95%,end
I would love to see Vivi blossom
into a fabulous dancer,

00:31:30.688 --> 00:31:34.459 line:95%,end
and I'm going to use all of my resources
to help her go at her own pace.

00:31:34.525 --> 00:31:37.061 line:95%,end
No word from you?

00:31:37.128 --> 00:31:40.965 line:95%,end
Hey, when you show up with Vivi
and we put her against Mackenzie,

00:31:41.032 --> 00:31:42.901 line:95%,end
that's all the words I need.

00:31:45.169 --> 00:31:49.874 line:95%,end
I think the biggest mistake you ever made
was taking Vivian out of my studio.

00:31:49.941 --> 00:31:52.644 line:95%,end
Oh, but Abby, I own my own dance studio.

00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:54.212 line:95%,end
I know. I teach lots of other dance--

00:31:54.279 --> 00:31:58.149 line:95%,end
I'm not going to-- I'm not going to leave
my child with you.

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:00.485 line:95%,end
So how about one more
question for Cathy?

00:32:00.551 --> 00:32:02.487 line:95%,end
Does anybody else have a question?

00:32:03.054 --> 00:32:06.524 line:95%,end
We've been reading that you are going
to get new dancers to try and beat Abby.

00:32:06.591 --> 00:32:07.659 line:95%,end
Is this true?

00:32:07.725 --> 00:32:10.929 line:95%,end
What I need to focus on is what
I'm going to be doing this season.

00:32:10.995 --> 00:32:12.563 line:95%,end
And I'm exploring my options.

00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:14.966 line:95%,end
How many of you guys love it
when Cathy is on the show?

00:32:15.033 --> 00:32:16.768 line:95%,end
I mean, come on.

00:32:17.635 --> 00:32:19.971 line:95%,end
I think you're the one
that should be called Sparky.

00:32:21.906 --> 00:32:23.875 line:95%,end
So, ladies, let's switch gears
here for a second.

00:32:23.942 --> 00:32:25.910 line:95%,end
It's time for one of my favorite dancers.

00:32:25.977 --> 00:32:28.146 line:95%,end
And I can't help it,
because she's the youngest one.

00:32:28.212 --> 00:32:30.815 line:95%,end
Give it up for Mackenzie,
who has a solo for us.

00:32:30.882 --> 00:32:32.884 line:95%,end

I feel fine.

I feel fine and dandy.

You got me making daisy chains.

Daisy. Yeah, I do.

00:33:38.282 --> 00:33:43.688 line:95%,end
You got me making daisy chains for you.

00:33:43.755 --> 00:33:46.190 line:95%,end
For you.

00:33:46.257 --> 00:33:48.326 line:95%,end
I made you a bracelet.

00:33:50.628 --> 00:33:53.431 line:95%,end
Yes, you do.

and all the moms

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:04.342 line:95%,end
have been reunited on the stage.

00:34:04.409 --> 00:34:07.745 line:95%,end
And they are preparing for a season
of big reveals,

00:34:07.812 --> 00:34:10.348 line:95%,end
big alliances, and new rivalries.

00:34:11.582 --> 00:34:13.818 line:95%,end
This next introduction is
for a group performance.

00:34:13.885 --> 00:34:15.987 line:95%,end
It's all of our girls here together

00:34:16.054 --> 00:34:19.957 line:95%,end
performing one of Abby's award winning
controversial group numbers,

00:34:20.024 --> 00:34:22.226 line:95%,end
"My Final Text."

00:34:22.293 --> 00:34:23.995 line:95%,end

JEFF: okay, there you have it, the
National Grand Champion winning routine.

00:36:08.332 --> 00:36:10.134 line:95%,end
So, Abby, this next question is for you.

00:36:10.201 --> 00:36:13.171 line:95%,end
So we just finished doing the competition
elimination show this summer,

00:36:13.237 --> 00:36:14.872 line:95%,end
where you got to eliminate people.

00:36:14.939 --> 00:36:16.908 line:95%,end
If we could change the rules around

00:36:16.974 --> 00:36:21.512 line:95%,end
and you could eliminate one of these moms,
who would you eliminate today?

00:36:23.981 --> 00:36:26.717 line:95%,end
I think that would be a five-way tie.

00:36:26.784 --> 00:36:29.787 line:95%,end
I'd keep the kids
and I'd send them all packing.

00:36:30.755 --> 00:36:34.492 line:95%,end
Moms, do you think Abby would be
as successful as she is without your kids?

00:36:34.559 --> 00:36:37.695 line:95%,end
I think that it's a symbiotic
relationship,

00:36:37.762 --> 00:36:41.666 line:95%,end
that Abby needs our girls just as much
as our girls need Abby.

00:36:41.732 --> 00:36:44.602 line:95%,end
In the world, people know your name

00:36:44.669 --> 00:36:46.604 line:95%,end
because of what the girls have
been able to produce

00:36:46.671 --> 00:36:48.139 line:95%,end
based on what you have taught them.

00:36:48.206 --> 00:36:50.174 line:95%,end
Whoa! Wait a minute!

00:36:50.241 --> 00:36:53.444 line:95%,end
Are there dance teachers here?
A lot of people knew Abby's Girls.

00:36:53.511 --> 00:36:56.681 line:95%,end
I had Abby's Girls before
you guys were even pregnant.

00:36:56.747 --> 00:36:58.950 line:95%,end
- And giving birth to children.
- But they were Abby's Girls.

00:36:59.016 --> 00:37:00.184 line:95%,end
They weren't Abby.

00:37:00.251 --> 00:37:03.621 line:95%,end
So, Christi, when you were
out here before and you left,

00:37:03.688 --> 00:37:05.856 line:95%,end
you seemed visibly upset.

00:37:05.923 --> 00:37:09.927 line:95%,end
I sat there and I watched this woman
rip my daughter apart,

00:37:09.994 --> 00:37:11.696 line:95%,end
again, on national television.

00:37:11.762 --> 00:37:14.999 line:95%,end
She had nothing negative to say
about Nia, Mackenzie or Maddie.

00:37:15.066 --> 00:37:16.701 line:95%,end
She had horrible things about Chloe

00:37:16.767 --> 00:37:19.036 line:95%,end
because she is jealous
that Chloe has a fan base.

00:37:19.103 --> 00:37:20.538 line:95%,end
And I will tell you this.

00:37:20.605 --> 00:37:23.741 line:95%,end
People love Chloe
and it drives her crazy.

00:37:23.808 --> 00:37:26.577 line:95%,end
She's the underdog. Everybody loves
the underdog. Look at Rocky.

00:37:26.644 --> 00:37:29.280 line:95%,end
So, Christi, do you ever feel like
that you take things too far?

00:37:29.347 --> 00:37:31.415 line:95%,end
Is it true that you tried to choke Cathy?


00:37:31.482 --> 00:37:34.051 line:95%,end
No. There-- there was a lot of
stuff going on that night.

00:37:34.118 --> 00:37:36.454 line:95%,end
I think it was Tanya
who pushed you off the curb.

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:38.155 line:95%,end
I lunged for you, like this.

00:37:38.222 --> 00:37:41.425 line:95%,end
But I think it was Tanya
who actually put the fingers on you.

00:37:41.492 --> 00:37:44.495 line:95%,end
No. Tanya was the one that pushed--
that got you off of me.

00:37:44.562 --> 00:37:46.130 line:95%,end
No, Cathy.
I never connected with you.

00:37:46.197 --> 00:37:47.465 line:95%,end
Tanya was the one that got you off of me.

00:37:47.531 --> 00:37:49.934 line:95%,end
Abby can't wait to have me arrested.
I know.

00:37:50.001 --> 00:37:53.738 line:95%,end
So does anybody else have anything they
wanna get off their chest before we leave?

00:37:53.804 --> 00:37:55.539 line:95%,end
- Everyone's replaceable.
- Yes.

00:37:55.606 --> 00:37:57.141 line:95%,end
I know. Replace me.

00:37:57.208 --> 00:37:59.944 line:95%,end
- Melissa, you've been awfully quiet.
- You know I, always try to find light.

00:38:00.011 --> 00:38:03.781 line:95%,end
And I said I always have a love for Abby.

00:38:03.848 --> 00:38:05.650 line:95%,end
My kids adore her.

00:38:05.716 --> 00:38:09.420 line:95%,end
I think anybody that watches
the show can agree

00:38:09.487 --> 00:38:13.324 line:95%,end
that Paige is probably the one
that Abby picks on the most.

00:38:13.391 --> 00:38:17.528 line:95%,end
And, like, Paige had her communion.

00:38:17.595 --> 00:38:21.766 line:95%,end
We wrote out 200 invitations,
and to her grandma,

00:38:21.832 --> 00:38:25.703 line:95%,end
and to everybody.
And Paige just wrote everybody's name.

00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:28.806 line:95%,end
And for Abby's
she put a big heart on it.

00:38:28.873 --> 00:38:32.677 line:95%,end
And, like, because all Paige wants
is Abby's approval,

00:38:32.743 --> 00:38:35.479 line:95%,end
even though she's mean to her.

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:37.548 line:95%,end
We've got to wrap this up right here.

00:38:37.615 --> 00:38:39.717 line:95%,end
So, hopefully, we're going
to be able to resolve some of these things

00:38:39.784 --> 00:38:41.319 line:95%,end
in the season that's coming up.

00:38:41.385 --> 00:38:43.254 line:95%,end
Now, look, I know tonight
things got a little heated.

00:38:43.321 --> 00:38:45.022 line:95%,end
But this was only the beginning.

00:38:45.089 --> 00:38:47.825 line:95%,end
It's time to take a look at an
exclusive sneak preview

00:38:47.892 --> 00:38:50.394 line:95%,end
of what will be one of the
most volatile, chaotic,

00:38:50.461 --> 00:38:53.297 line:95%,end
drama-filled seasons of
"Dance Moms" yet to come.

00:38:53.364 --> 00:38:55.333 line:95%,end
So thanks for all of you
ladies for being here.

00:39:11.749 --> 00:39:13.551 line:95%,end
I have two spots.

No. I don't want to go back.
