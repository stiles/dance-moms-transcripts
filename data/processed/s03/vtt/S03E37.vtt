But what happens to your
feet on the side aerial?

What happens to your knees
on those turns in second?

And next, Brooke.

You go out on stage, headpiece falls off.

- Right.
- She-- the duet is two people.

00:02:34.254 --> 00:02:36.156 line:95%,end
Why would she be on the
bottom of the pyramid?

Kendall, maybe your mother
should keep your mouth shut.

She wants to be part of this team.

better dancer two years ago.

CHRISTI: Chloe is Abby's
reigning National Champion.

00:03:09.622 --> 00:03:12.892 line:5%,start
And if she can't see that
Chloe just wants to please her,

that's Abby's problem.

And next, Asia.

00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:22.535 line:95%,end
Asia, I thought you did a great dance
in the duet, as the doll.

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:25.471 line:95%,end
In the group routine
I thought you were a hot mess.

And next, Mackenzie.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.846 line:95%,end
You won the overall high score
in the mini division

00:03:34.647 --> 00:03:37.217 line:95%,end
and you fell on your head
and ruined the whole line

why Jill is looking so smug.

is going to beat Chloe out

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:01.167 line:95%,end
for this solo at nationals.

00:05:01.234 --> 00:05:02.969 line:95%,end
Chloe is the reigning National Champion.

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:04.437 line:95%,end
She beat Maddie last year.

00:05:04.504 --> 00:05:06.506 line:95%,end
I'm pretty sure that
she can take on Kendall.

00:05:06.873 --> 00:05:10.376 line:95%,end
Asia, you should be the automatic shoo-in.

00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:13.479 line:95%,end
But last week you made some mistakes.

00:05:14.914 --> 00:05:17.850 line:95%,end
Mackenzie, your solo won the overall.

00:05:19.619 --> 00:05:21.754 line:95%,end
Both of you will be learning
the same choreography.

00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:23.623 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Mackenzie has better technique,

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.825 line:95%,end
but she doesn't perform
the same way Asia does.

00:05:25.925 --> 00:05:28.661 line:5%,start
So Asia will probably be
the one that is picked.

00:05:29.262 --> 00:05:33.800 line:95%,end

learning the same choreography.

to have a fair chance.

be a level playing field.

your jacket on at all times.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.236 line:95%,end
Don't you want people to
know who you represent?

00:08:23.302 --> 00:08:26.539 line:95%,end
OK. You get that jacket and
you sleep with that jacket

The group number is called "Voodoo,"

It's like, I would give this
to a senior company somewhere,

00:08:39.051 --> 00:08:41.320 line:95%,end

that have never,

00:08:41.387 --> 00:08:43.155 line:95%,end
ever done my style before.

00:08:43.222 --> 00:08:45.591 line:95%,end

really challenging for them.

CATHY: Like, are they pliÃ©ing
down to the rond de jambe

00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:51.030 line:95%,end

in relevÃ© out of their turn?

one more pliÃ© to window there.

- Uh-huh.

--are you staying in relevÃ©
or are you pliÃ©ing to rond de

jambe?
- I would love it--

00:08:59.705 --> 00:09:01.140 line:95%,end
CATHY: Staying up in relevÃ©.
- --staying up on relevÃ©.

00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:02.375 line:95%,end
CATHY: Yeah.

00:09:02.441 --> 00:09:03.976 line:95%,end
But if we need to pliÃ©
pop, I'm not mad at it.

are you-- are you excited

about Payton?

00:09:09.148 --> 00:09:10.650 line:95%,end
I know you want Payton to have a solo.

tell us who our soloists are.

00:09:20.426 --> 00:09:23.596 line:95%,end
I have to say, if she's only
giving out X many of solos,

00:09:24.096 --> 00:09:28.367 line:95%,end
I find it wrong that
she would give one of those solo spots

to Payton, who's not even
really a member on the team.

Can I tell you something?

I-- I think it's official
that we are on the team.

I don't give a crap if I'm on your team

to do a solo, let her do a solo.

who's going to get the solo.

00:10:07.039 --> 00:10:09.809 line:95%,end

from the style of the dance,
who it's going to be for.

00:13:36.415 --> 00:13:39.785 line:95%,end
You can't take Paige's choreography

just having other girls dance

is a fabulous opportunity.

- Maddie.

her national title--

00:14:22.394 --> 00:14:24.830 line:95%,end
because she's still better than
Chloe beat Maddie last year--

00:14:25.231 --> 00:14:26.866 line:95%,end
more so than even the group number.

00:14:26.966 --> 00:14:28.267 line:95%,end
I really--
- Do you really feel that way?

00:14:28.334 --> 00:14:29.468 line:95%,end
Yes, because she--

00:14:29.535 --> 00:14:30.669 line:95%,end
She's had so many wins since nationals.

00:14:30.736 --> 00:14:32.204 line:95%,end
I think you still have that in your head.

00:14:32.271 --> 00:14:33.873 line:95%,end
No, no. She said it to-- Leslie--

00:14:33.973 --> 00:14:35.174 line:95%,end

00:14:37.977 --> 00:14:39.545 line:95%,end
would she be spending an
hour and a half working

00:14:39.612 --> 00:14:41.013 line:95%,end
on Maddie's solo?

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.314 line:95%,end
No!

00:14:42.381 --> 00:14:43.916 line:95%,end

I will see the light.

Abby isn't fooling anyone
with the whole Maddie, Nia, Paige,

like, solo focus session.

00:14:51.156 --> 00:14:54.660 line:95%,end
We know it's Maddie's solo,
and it's obvious to everyone in the room.

00:14:54.727 --> 00:14:57.029 line:95%,end
I know that dance--

00:14:57.563 --> 00:15:00.733 line:95%,end
there's no chance in hell
that Paige will get that. Or Nia.

00:15:00.799 --> 00:15:03.302 line:95%,end
LESLIE: So you think Maddie's
definitely getting this solo, then?

00:15:03.369 --> 00:15:05.304 line:95%,end
I-- I don't--
I don't definitely know anything.

MELISSA: But I'm just saying--

00:15:06.572 --> 00:15:07.773 line:95%,end
LESLIE: While you
were in there, Christi said

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:10.809 line:95%,end
that her Chloe was definitely not going
to get the solo.

00:15:10.876 --> 00:15:13.379 line:95%,end

between Leslie and Christi.

00:21:35.394 --> 00:21:37.963 line:95%,end
I just-- I'm just not going to sit here
and play the game with them.

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:42.034 line:95%,end
I'd rather just go and do what
we need to do, and take her.

00:21:42.167 --> 00:21:43.969 line:95%,end
Well, I'm heartbroken
and you're killing me

00:21:44.069 --> 00:21:45.404 line:95%,end
that you're taking her away.

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:48.907 line:95%,end
Because we had a good run
and she's leaving undefeated.

00:21:49.741 --> 00:21:51.977 line:95%,end
Well, I feel bad. Are you-- are you going
to tell her or am I going to tell her?

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:54.346 line:95%,end
We can both go in there. I mean--

00:21:56.882 --> 00:21:59.217 line:95%,end
ABBY: Girls, I have an
announcement to make.

00:21:59.785 --> 00:22:04.856 line:95%,end
It is with great sadness, Asia has
to cut her trip short

00:22:05.757 --> 00:22:08.393 line:95%,end
and not participate
in our national finals.

00:22:10.329 --> 00:22:13.098 line:95%,end

Don't make me cry.

00:22:15.934 --> 00:22:17.302 line:95%,end
Bye.

ABBY: How could two mothers
representing the Abby Lee Dance Company

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:23.909 line:95%,end
go out in the middle of Bourbon Street

00:22:23.975 --> 00:22:26.478 line:95%,end
and get into a scuffle with each other?

00:22:26.745 --> 00:22:28.647 line:95%,end
Well, well, well.

00:22:28.714 --> 00:22:30.315 line:95%,end
Had a rough morning already.

00:22:30.382 --> 00:22:31.717 line:95%,end
You're succeeded in driving

00:22:31.783 --> 00:22:34.353 line:95%,end
yet another dancer away
from the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:22:34.419 --> 00:22:36.521 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: We were out.
It was nothing to do with you

00:22:36.588 --> 00:22:38.657 line:95%,end
or the Abby Lee Dance Company or the kids.

00:22:38.724 --> 00:22:41.860 line:95%,end
ABBY: You are all here because
the Abby Lee Dance Company is

00:22:41.927 --> 00:22:43.428 line:95%,end
attending a national finals.

00:22:44.796 --> 00:22:47.799 line:95%,end
To say the least,
it was unsportsmanlike behavior.

00:22:48.233 --> 00:22:50.135 line:95%,end
Christi, you're out.

00:22:50.736 --> 00:22:52.037 line:95%,end
Chloe is gone for this week.

00:22:52.804 --> 00:22:55.774 line:95%,end
Leslie, you have to take Payton home.


00:22:55.974 --> 00:22:57.743 line:95%,end
You're gone.

00:22:59.144 --> 00:23:00.379 line:95%,end
Hot damn.

KELLY: Here it is the day before nationals

00:23:03.048 --> 00:23:04.983 line:5%,start
and we're down three kids.

00:23:05.117 --> 00:23:07.085 line:5%,start
I don't understand why
Abby couldn't have just

00:23:07.152 --> 00:23:09.721 line:95%,end
left the kids in the dance
and made the moms leave.

00:23:09.788 --> 00:23:12.491 line:95%,end
We are back to square one,
to the drawing board.

00:23:12.557 --> 00:23:14.826 line:95%,end
OK? So we need
everybody's brains together.

00:23:14.893 --> 00:23:17.562 line:95%,end
We can't dwell on the past.
We need to move forward.

00:23:17.629 --> 00:23:18.730 line:95%,end
Things happen for a reason.

00:23:18.797 --> 00:23:23.335 line:95%,end
I would rather take a loss
at the national competition

00:23:24.169 --> 00:23:28.507 line:95%,end
than to let these two women
stay here one more minute.

00:23:29.007 --> 00:23:34.713 line:95%,end
And now I am down
three dancers with 24 hours

down to business.

This is our last day.
Nationals are tomorrow.

00:23:44.055 --> 00:23:47.325 line:5%,start
So, guys, let's get up.
Let's do the group dance.

00:23:47.492 --> 00:23:49.461 line:5%,start
It's going to be amazing. OK?

00:23:49.528 --> 00:23:50.729 line:5%,start
Let's work some magic!

00:23:50.796 --> 00:23:53.498 line:5%,start
Our group number this week is "Voodoo."

00:23:53.665 --> 00:23:56.067 line:5%,start
I like dark, mysterious things.

00:23:56.168 --> 00:23:58.570 line:5%,start
And we're in New Orleans, so what--

00:23:59.004 --> 00:24:04.176 line:5%,start
what an appropriate number to do
but, you know, mystic magic voodoo.

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:08.480 line:95%,end
Big line, ha. Good.
That's going chest-- turn this way.

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:10.682 line:95%,end
Hey, Blake, I don't
want to step on your toes.

00:24:10.749 --> 00:24:12.050 line:95%,end
BLAKE: Yes. Please.
- I just have a question.

00:24:12.184 --> 00:24:14.686 line:95%,end
Do you think it would look
better for-- for continuity

00:24:14.753 --> 00:24:17.956 line:95%,end
and visualness
if Zack was the very first one?

00:24:18.056 --> 00:24:19.891 line:95%,end
Switch spots once with her.

00:24:20.125 --> 00:24:21.660 line:95%,end
Or is there some way-- BLAKE: Yeah.

00:24:21.726 --> 00:24:24.062 line:95%,end
--that you could put him
in the-- in the middle?

00:24:24.129 --> 00:24:25.397 line:95%,end
Lucas, can you grow?

00:24:25.497 --> 00:24:26.598 line:95%,end
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:26.665 --> 00:24:29.601 line:95%,end
- Can you grow today?
- How about some "Drink Me" juice?

00:24:29.935 --> 00:24:32.370 line:95%,end
Obviously, there's always work to be done.

00:24:32.571 --> 00:24:36.174 line:95%,end
Blake and I are just literally
nit picking right now,

00:24:36.308 --> 00:24:37.709 line:95%,end
making things sharper.

00:24:37.776 --> 00:24:39.911 line:95%,end
But I'm happy with the way
our group dance looks.

00:24:40.045 --> 00:24:41.813 line:95%,end
Abby can't compete with this.

00:24:42.447 --> 00:24:43.615 line:95%,end
BLAKE: Very good.

00:24:43.682 --> 00:24:46.251 line:5%,start
Not-- not bad for our first time through.

00:24:48.119 --> 00:24:50.422 line:5%,start
ABBY: Today has been quite interesting.

00:24:50.489 --> 00:24:55.060 line:95%,end
Sometimes when adults are out and
they're in adult places, things happen.

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:59.364 line:95%,end
You came here to attend
a national competition.

00:24:59.431 --> 00:25:03.401 line:95%,end
I am very, very upset that these women

00:25:03.468 --> 00:25:06.137 line:95%,end
chose to do this at our nationals.

00:25:06.204 --> 00:25:08.373 line:95%,end
All right. Let's see what we have.

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:10.876 line:95%,end
There is no time for rest.

00:25:10.942 --> 00:25:14.346 line:95%,end
I have to re-block the entire group
number.

Yes.

We are down three team members.

00:25:26.925 --> 00:25:28.860 line:95%,end
We have to pull out a win.

00:25:28.927 --> 00:25:30.629 line:95%,end
You have a solo tomorrow.

Last year you didn't
win that national title.

00:25:33.932 --> 00:25:35.500 line:95%,end
I think you should have.

00:25:35.967 --> 00:25:39.871 line:95%,end
Kendall, Chloe's absence
means you get the solo.

00:25:40.105 --> 00:25:42.974 line:95%,end
You have an opportunity.
Don't throw it away.

00:25:44.042 --> 00:25:48.280 line:95%,end
Brooke, I'm not having you do the solo
that you and Payton worked on.

You held your national title all year.

I'm not even going to mess with that. OK?

00:25:57.856 --> 00:26:00.292 line:95%,end
Abby said she is
eliminating Brooke's solo.

00:26:00.358 --> 00:26:03.361 line:95%,end
But I knew from the second
that I heard that music

00:26:03.461 --> 00:26:05.230 line:95%,end
that that solo wasn't meant for Brooke.

00:26:05.297 --> 00:26:07.899 line:95%,end
ABBY: Mackenzie, you have a solo tomorrow.

MELISSA: I just feel relief. Asia's gone.

00:26:10.435 --> 00:26:12.971 line:5%,start
I think it's going to
help Mackenzie relax more,

00:26:13.038 --> 00:26:15.373 line:5%,start
and Mackenzie deserves
a solo at nationals.
