<i>Previously on Dance Moms...</i>

00:00:03.136 --> 00:00:04.337 line:5%,start
I just take Kelly back.

00:00:04.404 --> 00:00:05.472 line:5%,start
I know, that's the plan.

00:00:05.538 --> 00:00:06.873 line:5%,start
Girls, where are you?

00:00:07.774 --> 00:00:10.176 line:5%,start
I'm going to replace the entire team!

00:00:10.243 --> 00:00:12.012 line:5%,start
They are replacing... our kids.

00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:15.215 line:5%,start

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:17.217 line:5%,start
<i>You have to win!</i>

00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:19.052 line:5%,start
Do you want to be there
for Miss Abby?

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:20.120 line:5%,start
Yeah!

00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:21.554 line:5%,start
Nowhere else to go.

00:00:21.988 --> 00:00:24.924 line:5%,start
Second is not good enough
for the Abby Lee Dance Company!

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:27.560 line:5%,start
Thank God for you, Sophia.
Thank God!

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:30.864 line:5%,start
<i>Coming up on Dance Moms'</i>

00:00:30.997 --> 00:00:32.198 line:5%,start
Well, well, well...

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.601 line:5%,start
While you all were at the parking lot

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:36.069 line:5%,start
Sophia was in here!

00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:37.704 line:5%,start
Sophia!

00:00:38.138 --> 00:00:39.472 line:5%,start
You were doing your solo...

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:41.074 line:5%,start
I think she is fabulous!

00:00:41.808 --> 00:00:43.810 line:5%,start
...quite, she is gonna beat
our kids every time...

00:00:45.178 --> 00:00:47.113 line:5%,start
Maddie, I think before Sophia was here

00:00:47.414 --> 00:00:48.715 line:5%,start
you hit those accents.

00:00:48.848 --> 00:00:51.451 line:5%,start
You just seem like,
a daylight a dollar short.

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:53.686 line:5%,start
Chloe is a product of you.

00:00:53.787 --> 00:00:56.289 line:5%,start
Chloe was awful today!

00:00:57.557 --> 00:00:59.559 line:5%,start
What are we do to our kids?

SOPHIA:<i> Hello!</i>
ABBY LEE: Hi, sweetie, how are you?

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:21.681 line:95%,end
Go ahead in. You can start warming up.

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:23.083 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE:<i> Last week was really tough.</i>

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:24.651 line:5%,start
I pulled a replacement team in.

00:01:24.717 --> 00:01:25.718 line:95%,end
Hi.

00:01:25.785 --> 00:01:28.288 line:95%,end
Go ahead right through into the den,
and the girls can start stretching.

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:32.025 line:95%,end
Even though we got second,
I would much rather work with these kids.

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:36.229 line:95%,end
Pretty soon, those old moms will just be
a distant memory.

00:01:38.898 --> 00:01:40.500 line:95%,end
Real dance moms are here.

00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:45.738 line:5%,start
Melissa's a high-maintenance friend.

00:01:46.973 --> 00:01:47.974 line:5%,start
Well...

00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:51.411 line:5%,start
I realize now that the way Abby
treats my girls is never gonna change.

00:01:51.478 --> 00:01:53.880 line:5%,start
<i>But they miss the studio,</i>
<i>and they even miss Abby.</i>

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:56.616 line:95%,end
<i>I know the last person</i>
<i>Abby wants to see is me,</i>

00:01:56.683 --> 00:01:58.418 line:95%,end
but the other moms won't come
back without me,

00:01:58.485 --> 00:02:01.121 line:95%,end
and all of our girls are dying
to be at dance again.

00:02:01.187 --> 00:02:02.288 line:95%,end
You're part of the team.

00:02:02.355 --> 00:02:04.424 line:95%,end
That's the whole point
of this whole thing.

00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:06.659 line:95%,end
CHRISTI:<i> It's great that Kelly</i>
<i>wants to be back on the team.</i>

00:02:06.726 --> 00:02:09.896 line:95%,end
The problem is, it's too late.
Abby's replaced us.

00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:13.166 line:95%,end
And now we have to go crawling back
to Abby, begging her to take us all back.

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:15.902 line:95%,end
I'm not signing a thing until your name is
on it and you're walking through the door.

00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:17.737 line:95%,end
And I think we all need to stick to that.

00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:20.006 line:95%,end
[phone line ringing]

00:02:21.441 --> 00:02:23.243 line:95%,end
Hi, Shelly? This is Abby.

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:26.779 line:95%,end
It's about a half an hour into rehearsal,
and I don't have Ally.

00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:28.915 line:95%,end
She is not the kind of kid
that's gonna be late.

00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:32.318 line:95%,end
I'm calling to find out where Ally is.
She was supposed to be here at 4:00.

00:02:33.753 --> 00:02:36.189 line:95%,end
She is in New Orleans!

00:02:36.256 --> 00:02:37.690 line:95%,end
All the way back home.

00:02:37.757 --> 00:02:39.058 line:95%,end
How did this get screwed up?

00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:48.101 line:95%,end
Your daughter came in second place--

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:50.703 line:95%,end
probably the reason the team
came in second place--

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.005 line:95%,end
and now she's gonna come in and be mad,

00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:53.706 line:95%,end
and you're just like, "It's all good."

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:58.912 line:5%,start
Ally could not be blamed
for that group dance.

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:00.547 line:95%,end
She was magnificent.

00:03:00.647 --> 00:03:01.781 line:95%,end
Give my best to Ally.

00:03:01.948 --> 00:03:03.850 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE:<i> They were blaming her</i>

00:03:04.117 --> 00:03:06.186 line:95%,end
<i>for the group dance</i>
<i>coming in second? Crazy.</i>

00:03:06.452 --> 00:03:08.388 line:95%,end
Oh, my God. Here we go again.

00:03:08.488 --> 00:03:10.290 line:95%,end
Same old story.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.859 line:95%,end
Jealousy is an ugly disease.

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.060 line:95%,end
You can ask Christi.

00:03:14.227 --> 00:03:17.931 line:95%,end
Girls... go head into the studio A,
start warming up in there.

00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:21.367 line:95%,end
I just got off the phone with Shelly.

00:03:21.434 --> 00:03:24.270 line:95%,end
She said, "Those other two mothers

00:03:24.337 --> 00:03:27.840 line:95%,end
"were telling my kid that she
was the reason we lost the group."

00:03:28.808 --> 00:03:29.809 line:95%,end
No.

00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:31.945 line:95%,end
This is my livelihood. This is what I do.

00:03:32.011 --> 00:03:35.114 line:95%,end
I don't have a husband
that has a million-dollar job.

00:03:35.181 --> 00:03:36.416 line:5%,start
I don't... I don't do that.

00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:38.017 line:95%,end
And the kid cried all the way home.

00:03:38.084 --> 00:03:40.887 line:95%,end
These moms pushed one
of my best dancers out.

00:03:40.954 --> 00:03:43.590 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: You know what?
No more Mrs. Nice Guy.

00:03:43.656 --> 00:03:44.791 line:95%,end
It's over.

00:03:44.857 --> 00:03:46.459 line:95%,end
You two... are out.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.297 line:95%,end
Glo, Marcia... Poof! Be gone.

00:03:52.165 --> 00:03:53.866 line:95%,end
[crying]
Why do we have to leave?

00:03:53.933 --> 00:03:56.669 line:5%,start
Mom?
You guys are the one that blamed it.

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:57.837 line:95%,end
Just don't fight.

00:03:57.904 --> 00:03:59.539 line:95%,end
We want to stay.
[sniffs]

00:03:59.606 --> 00:04:01.407 line:95%,end
Apologize. Go say sorry.


00:04:01.474 --> 00:04:02.675 line:95%,end
We did.

00:04:02.742 --> 00:04:05.478 line:95%,end
We want this really badly, Mom.

00:04:05.878 --> 00:04:08.014 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: I can't believe
this has all happened.

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:10.550 line:95%,end
I am left with one member

00:04:10.617 --> 00:04:14.187 line:95%,end
of the Abby Lee Dance Company
Elite Competition Team.

00:04:14.454 --> 00:04:17.457 line:5%,start
âª âª

00:04:19.492 --> 00:04:20.793 line:95%,end
All right, we'll take off now.

00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:24.097 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: You are the only one left.

00:04:24.697 --> 00:04:27.533 line:95%,end
So when we go away this weekend,
you need to win your division

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.570 line:95%,end
and you need to win
the entire competition.

00:04:33.973 --> 00:04:37.143 line:95%,end
I don't want to piss her off more...
me walking in.

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.211 line:95%,end
MELISSA: See, you're dying.

00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:40.913 line:95%,end
I'm dying.
I think we need to go... let's move along.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.315 line:95%,end
This is stupid.

00:04:43.416 --> 00:04:45.985 line:95%,end
KELLY:<i> Abby basically blames me</i>
<i>for the team falling apart.</i>

00:04:46.052 --> 00:04:49.956 line:95%,end
So I think if I stay outside, we'll
have a better chance at reconciliation.

00:04:51.324 --> 00:04:54.327 line:95%,end
- What are they doing?
- Oh, my God.

00:04:54.394 --> 00:04:59.599 line:95%,end
I can't believe the same moms who quit
for Kelly and her two kids

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:01.467 line:95%,end
are back in my parking lot again.

00:05:01.634 --> 00:05:04.203 line:95%,end
But you know what?
I just might have some openings.

00:05:04.404 --> 00:05:06.439 line:95%,end
- Ladies.
- [quietly] Contact.

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:08.975 line:95%,end
You come in and dance or you leave.

00:05:09.042 --> 00:05:10.843 line:95%,end
You don't loiter in the parking lot.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.612 line:95%,end
Are we being invited in?
Can we come in now?

00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:14.914 line:95%,end
If you want to come, the door is open.

00:05:15.348 --> 00:05:17.116 line:95%,end
- JILL: All right, let's go.
- I'll come in. I'll walk with you.

00:05:17.183 --> 00:05:18.885 line:95%,end
This isn't a church, Holly,
it's a dance studio.

00:05:18.951 --> 00:05:20.353 line:95%,end
HOLLY: I got God all on my side.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:21.587 line:95%,end
He comes with me wherever I go.

00:05:21.654 --> 00:05:22.989 line:95%,end
Yeah, you got God on your thighs, too.

00:05:23.056 --> 00:05:24.891 line:95%,end
The moms quitting was their choice.

00:05:24.957 --> 00:05:27.960 line:95%,end
They're quitters, that's what they do.
That wasn't my choice.

00:05:28.027 --> 00:05:30.663 line:95%,end
They walked out of here,
and if they think...

00:05:30.763 --> 00:05:33.032 line:5%,start
...that they're gonna walk back in,
they have another thing coming.

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:36.703 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: Each year,
Abby has us sign this stupid contract

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:38.304 line:5%,start
that locks us in for a year.

00:05:38.371 --> 00:05:43.343 line:95%,end
And in that year, you can't leave
her studio, you know, short of death.

00:05:43.543 --> 00:05:46.112 line:95%,end
You will not get past this front desk
without these being signed.

00:05:46.212 --> 00:05:47.246 line:95%,end
Where's Kelly's?

00:05:47.313 --> 00:05:50.183 line:95%,end
Kelly called me names, Kelly quit,

00:05:50.316 --> 00:05:54.053 line:95%,end
Kelly boo-hooed,
and her kids are lazy slugs!

00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:57.290 line:95%,end
JILL: We feel that
Kelly is a part of our team.

00:05:57.357 --> 00:05:59.959 line:95%,end
Jill, did you come here
because Kelly's kids were here?

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:03.062 line:95%,end
You want to be loyal to somebody,
it should be me.

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:06.065 line:5%,start
This is the hardest thing for me,
because my kids want to dance,

00:06:06.165 --> 00:06:08.067 line:5%,start
and I don't know how long I can hold off.

00:06:08.134 --> 00:06:12.238 line:95%,end
You took Maddie and put her on
the same level as the rest of those kids.

00:06:12.605 --> 00:06:15.942 line:95%,end
We didn't.
We worked our butts off with your kids.

00:06:17.643 --> 00:06:18.911 line:95%,end
Make a decision.

00:06:18.978 --> 00:06:20.747 line:95%,end
Well, I brought Kendall here to dance.

00:06:20.947 --> 00:06:23.883 line:95%,end
I need her to dance, I want her to dance.

00:06:24.217 --> 00:06:25.318 line:95%,end
That's my decision.

00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:26.853 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: Finished.

00:06:29.822 --> 00:06:31.290 line:95%,end
Make a decision right now.

00:06:31.624 --> 00:06:33.893 line:95%,end
You either choose
the Abby Lee Dance Company,

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.229 line:95%,end
or you can go play with Brooke and Paige.

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:38.631 line:95%,end
âª âª

00:06:39.766 --> 00:06:41.401 line:95%,end
Well, my kids are not gonna be playing.

00:06:41.467 --> 00:06:43.002 line:95%,end
They're gonna be dancing.

00:06:44.537 --> 00:06:47.407 line:95%,end
HOLLY: I... I'm disappointed
in Melissa and Jill.

00:06:47.473 --> 00:06:49.142 line:5%,start
We had worked so hard.

00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:50.676 line:5%,start
It was like all of that was in vain.

00:06:50.743 --> 00:06:51.911 line:95%,end
Time is ticking, ladies.

00:06:51.978 --> 00:06:55.982 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: At this point, I think Holly and
I have really done as much as we can do.

00:06:56.048 --> 00:06:58.751 line:95%,end
We have said we're not going back
in without Kelly, and Abby's like,

00:06:58.818 --> 00:07:00.920 line:95%,end
"So? Don't let the door
hit you in the ass on the way out."

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:02.455 line:95%,end
All right, let's do it.

00:07:02.522 --> 00:07:04.390 line:95%,end
Okay. Give us the contract.

00:07:04.457 --> 00:07:07.693 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I think Kelly needs to go in
and fight for herself and her daughters.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:08.895 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: So if Kelly comes to you,

00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:11.330 line:95%,end
and they say that they want to be back
on this team, you would listen?

00:07:11.397 --> 00:07:13.266 line:95%,end
I would certainly listen to them.

00:07:15.701 --> 00:07:18.604 line:5%,start
KELLY: I just want today
to be the last day for this.

00:07:18.671 --> 00:07:20.373 line:95%,end
She made us sign the contract.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.576 line:95%,end
KELLY: I am gonna go in there, and I am
gonna get my kids back on the team.

00:07:25.478 --> 00:07:27.447 line:95%,end
- Hi, Kelly, how are you?
- Good. How are you?

00:07:27.513 --> 00:07:28.981 line:95%,end
So why do you want to come back?
You hate it here.

00:07:29.048 --> 00:07:31.117 line:95%,end
I don't want to come back.
My kids want to come back.

00:07:31.317 --> 00:07:35.888 line:95%,end
And every single mother in the group,
and kid in the group, wants us here.

00:07:36.088 --> 00:07:38.658 line:95%,end
You called me a whore,
you made fun of my weight,

00:07:38.724 --> 00:07:39.859 line:95%,end
you gave me the finger.

00:07:39.926 --> 00:07:41.894 line:95%,end
And you called my kids stupid.

00:07:42.195 --> 00:07:43.896 line:95%,end
They are. They make dumb choices.

00:07:43.963 --> 00:07:45.264 line:95%,end
Abby, I don't want to
argue with you anymore.

00:07:45.331 --> 00:07:47.099 line:95%,end
I want you to get over the [bleep]

00:07:47.166 --> 00:07:48.868 line:95%,end
that happened with us 30 years ago,

00:07:48.935 --> 00:07:51.637 line:95%,end
and treat my kids like you treat
everybody else in this studio.

00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:53.139 line:95%,end
That's what I want.

00:07:53.206 --> 00:07:54.841 line:95%,end
Well, I don't want
your kids to be mediocre.

00:07:54.907 --> 00:07:56.075 line:95%,end
I want them to be amazing.

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:58.177 line:95%,end
And if they're not willing to be amazing,

00:07:58.244 --> 00:08:00.046 line:95%,end
then... hit the door.

00:08:00.112 --> 00:08:02.148 line:95%,end
KELLY: I don't know what
the woman wants me to say<i>.</i>


00:08:02.215 --> 00:08:04.183 line:95%,end
I mean, my kids want to be
back on the team,

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:05.651 line:95%,end
they tried out for the team,

00:08:05.718 --> 00:08:07.019 line:95%,end
they made it...

00:08:07.086 --> 00:08:08.354 line:95%,end
They should be on the team.

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:12.658 line:5%,start
JILL:<i> So here we are,</i>

00:08:12.725 --> 00:08:13.960 line:95%,end
<i>we show up to class...</i>

00:08:14.026 --> 00:08:15.895 line:95%,end
<i>In walks Jaclyn,</i>

00:08:15.962 --> 00:08:18.130 line:5%,start
straight off of the streets of L.A.

00:08:18.197 --> 00:08:20.199 line:95%,end
<i>Skinny, skinny, skinny, gorgeous...</i>

00:08:20.266 --> 00:08:22.335 line:95%,end
but it's obvious she does not fit in

00:08:22.401 --> 00:08:24.170 line:95%,end
with our team of dance moms.

00:08:25.271 --> 00:08:26.672 line:95%,end
Well, well, well.

00:08:27.106 --> 00:08:29.008 line:95%,end
Here we all are again.

00:08:32.078 --> 00:08:33.646 line:95%,end
KELLY:<i> You know, I've just come</i>
<i>to the decision,</i>

00:08:33.713 --> 00:08:35.915 line:95%,end
<i>as hard as it's gonna be</i>
<i>for me to go in there</i>

00:08:35.982 --> 00:08:37.350 line:95%,end
<i>and kiss up to that woman,</i>

00:08:37.416 --> 00:08:38.584 line:95%,end
I'm going to do it.

00:08:39.385 --> 00:08:40.686 line:95%,end
Here's your contract.

00:08:41.888 --> 00:08:43.523 line:95%,end
Get in there, girls.

00:08:45.591 --> 00:08:47.994 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: Kelly hands me her
contract without a peep.

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:51.063 line:95%,end
There it is, signed, her signature.

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:53.633 line:95%,end
Now let's just see
if she can keep that mouth shut.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:58.971 line:95%,end
Ladies, last week, we went
to a competition in Fort Wayne, Indiana.

00:08:59.038 --> 00:09:01.307 line:95%,end
There were over a thousand people there

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:03.242 line:95%,end
just to see the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:09:04.176 --> 00:09:06.512 line:95%,end
While you all were out in the parking lot,

00:09:06.579 --> 00:09:10.116 line:95%,end
Sophia was in here, learning.

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:14.120 line:95%,end
As you can clearly see,
we don't have a pyramid here.

00:09:17.456 --> 00:09:18.491 line:95%,end
Chloe,

00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:19.959 line:95%,end
Nia,

00:09:20.593 --> 00:09:21.594 line:95%,end
Maddie,

00:09:21.994 --> 00:09:22.995 line:95%,end
Mackenzie,

00:09:23.829 --> 00:09:24.830 line:95%,end
Kendall,

00:09:25.998 --> 00:09:27.033 line:95%,end
you all realize...

00:09:27.767 --> 00:09:30.636 line:95%,end
...with the exception of Sophia,
that you are on probation.

00:09:33.606 --> 00:09:35.575 line:95%,end
You are all on the same playing field.

00:09:35.975 --> 00:09:39.211 line:95%,end
KELLY: Abby chooses
one kid in the studio that she focuses on.

00:09:39.278 --> 00:09:41.280 line:95%,end
<i>Now Maddie did something to piss Abby off,</i>

00:09:41.347 --> 00:09:43.215 line:95%,end
<i>and now she's moving on to somebody else.</i>

00:09:43.282 --> 00:09:44.884 line:95%,end
That's what all of you wanted.

00:09:45.318 --> 00:09:46.719 line:95%,end
You didn't like the pyramid, moms.

00:09:46.786 --> 00:09:48.955 line:95%,end
You want all the kids to be treated equal.

00:09:49.388 --> 00:09:50.389 line:95%,end
That's what you got.

00:09:52.024 --> 00:09:53.459 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Chloe's worked
her butt off for Abby,

00:09:53.559 --> 00:09:54.927 line:95%,end
and she won a national title,

00:09:55.027 --> 00:09:57.863 line:95%,end
<i>and now Abby's gonna replace her</i>
<i>with some girl off the street?</i>

00:09:58.264 --> 00:10:01.801 line:95%,end
Jackie, you're okay with your kid
being a winner.

00:10:01.934 --> 00:10:04.270 line:95%,end
I know that I can count on her,

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:05.972 line:95%,end
that she's a team player.

00:10:06.038 --> 00:10:07.773 line:95%,end
And, Jackie, I watched you
in the dressing room.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.142 line:95%,end
I watched you help
everybody with their hair.

00:10:10.343 --> 00:10:13.312 line:95%,end
I watched you be kind
to all the other women,

00:10:14.313 --> 00:10:16.082 line:95%,end
and I appreciate that.

00:10:16.248 --> 00:10:19.518 line:95%,end
KELLY: Jackie seems like
she's this perfect mom,

00:10:19.585 --> 00:10:21.520 line:95%,end
but I've heard a lot of things about her,

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:23.956 line:95%,end
and I don't know,
she doesn't seem so perfect.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.826 line:95%,end
This week, we are going to Ohio.

00:10:26.959 --> 00:10:30.363 line:95%,end
The group routine is called
"Red Carpet Special."

00:10:30.429 --> 00:10:33.432 line:95%,end
It's a really sassy, hot, funky number.

00:10:33.499 --> 00:10:34.734 line:95%,end
Sophia,

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.136 line:95%,end
you are doing a solo called "Superstar."

00:10:37.203 --> 00:10:39.639 line:95%,end
I think you did an
outstanding job last week,

00:10:39.705 --> 00:10:41.907 line:95%,end
and I want to see a repeat
of the same thing.

00:10:41.974 --> 00:10:44.410 line:95%,end
It is not fair that Sophia
gets a solo this week.

00:10:44.477 --> 00:10:48.247 line:95%,end
Our girls work their butts off,
and they die for solos every week.

00:10:48.381 --> 00:10:49.782 line:95%,end
How many turns do you do?

00:10:49.915 --> 00:10:51.150 line:95%,end
Fifty-four.

00:10:51.283 --> 00:10:53.719 line:95%,end
Why do I want somebody
that can only do 53?

00:10:53.786 --> 00:10:56.455 line:95%,end
I would prefer not
to take any other solos,

00:10:56.555 --> 00:10:59.325 line:95%,end
but I committed to attend the competition,

00:10:59.392 --> 00:11:00.626 line:95%,end
so we're going.

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.229 line:95%,end
Not one of these kids deserves a solo,

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:04.597 line:95%,end
but I have no choice.

00:11:04.697 --> 00:11:07.366 line:95%,end
So I'm gonna take my national champion

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.568 line:95%,end
and see how much she's regressed.

00:11:09.635 --> 00:11:12.805 line:95%,end
My next solo will be... Chloe.

00:11:13.239 --> 00:11:14.473 line:95%,end
It's contemporary.

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:16.942 line:95%,end
You are the national titleholder,

00:11:17.009 --> 00:11:18.477 line:95%,end
and you want to keep it up?

00:11:18.544 --> 00:11:20.046 line:95%,end
Then you have to keep winning.

00:11:20.112 --> 00:11:22.581 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Surprise, surprise,
Abby gives Chloe a solo,

00:11:22.648 --> 00:11:24.583 line:95%,end
not as a reward, but as a punishment,

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:26.585 line:95%,end
because she's gonna
make her dance against Sophia.

00:11:26.652 --> 00:11:29.155 line:95%,end
I want to direct my attention to the moms.

00:11:29.221 --> 00:11:32.458 line:95%,end
I need to see your loyalty

00:11:32.525 --> 00:11:34.326 line:95%,end
for what I'm doing for your children.

00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:38.464 line:95%,end
You will have assignments,
and you're gonna do a whole lot more

00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:41.167 line:95%,end
than sit on your butts
upstairs in my studio.

00:11:41.634 --> 00:11:45.204 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Did she forget that we're the
ones who pay her to teach our kids dance?

00:11:45.271 --> 00:11:47.273 line:95%,end
We have other children
and other responsibilities,

00:11:47.339 --> 00:11:50.076 line:95%,end
and you are not in charge of us.

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:54.213 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: Ooh.
Who has their nose up in the air?

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.783 line:95%,end
<i>They need to volunteer a little bit,</i>
<i>and if they don't want to,</i>

00:11:57.850 --> 00:11:59.218 line:95%,end
out the door.


00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:03.689 line:95%,end
âª

00:12:03.756 --> 00:12:05.658 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE:<i> Ladies, spread apart.</i>

00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:07.259 line:95%,end
We have lots of work to do.

00:12:07.326 --> 00:12:10.262 line:5%,start
This is all about being superstars.

00:12:10.463 --> 00:12:11.931 line:5%,start
Being celebrities.

00:12:11.997 --> 00:12:13.265 line:5%,start
Being on the red carpet.

00:12:13.332 --> 00:12:15.000 line:95%,end
Everybody wants to take your picture.

00:12:15.101 --> 00:12:16.902 line:95%,end
Everybody wants your autograph.

00:12:16.969 --> 00:12:18.904 line:95%,end
So that's what the piece is about.

00:12:18.971 --> 00:12:22.041 line:5%,start
You know, this team, they think
they're all back together again.

00:12:22.108 --> 00:12:24.844 line:95%,end
<i>I was left with absolutely no team.</i>

00:12:24.944 --> 00:12:27.913 line:95%,end
Sophia stepped in and saved the day.

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:31.617 line:95%,end
She's a star,
and they all better get used to it.

00:12:31.684 --> 00:12:35.454 line:95%,end
Be grateful that Sophia
has come to Pittsburgh

00:12:35.521 --> 00:12:36.956 line:95%,end
and joined our group.

00:12:37.423 --> 00:12:43.696 line:95%,end
It's like going from...
mediocre to flying first class.

00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:48.667 line:5%,start
CHLOE: Miss Abby kept saying how much...
how much better Sophia was than all of us,

00:12:48.734 --> 00:12:51.137 line:95%,end
<i>and that gave me a purpose</i>
<i>to work really hard</i>

00:12:51.203 --> 00:12:53.973 line:95%,end
to show Miss Abby one day
I will be as good as Sophia.

00:12:54.039 --> 00:12:58.477 line:95%,end
I-I wanted to see...
how many pirouettes? 58?

00:12:58.544 --> 00:12:59.945 line:95%,end
I think she can do 54.

00:13:00.012 --> 00:13:01.113 line:95%,end
- Fifty-four.
- In tap shoes.

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:02.348 line:95%,end
I want to see it.

00:13:02.948 --> 00:13:04.950 line:95%,end
KELLY:<i> That's a reflection on the teacher.</i>

00:13:05.017 --> 00:13:07.419 line:95%,end
<i>Like, she can say to our kids</i>
<i>"You can't turn,"</i>

00:13:07.486 --> 00:13:09.388 line:95%,end
<i>but she doesn't like when I say to her,</i>

00:13:09.455 --> 00:13:10.890 line:95%,end
"Well, you can't teach them to turn then."

00:13:10.956 --> 00:13:12.691 line:95%,end
Obviously, 'cause my kids have been here

00:13:12.758 --> 00:13:13.959 line:95%,end
since they've been two and a half.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.729 line:95%,end
- I think she's fabulous.
- Right.

00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:18.664 line:95%,end
And she's gonna beat our kids every time.

00:13:18.731 --> 00:13:19.865 line:95%,end
We understand that.

00:13:19.932 --> 00:13:23.669 line:95%,end
KELLY:<i> Melissa and Christi, they're</i>
<i>not feeling so welcoming to this woman.</i>

00:13:23.736 --> 00:13:24.804 line:5%,start
Get used to it.

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:26.705 line:5%,start
Your kid's not always gonna be the best.

00:13:26.906 --> 00:13:29.308 line:95%,end
JILL:<i> Why do you need to do</i>
<i>58 pirouettes in tap shoes?</i>

00:13:29.375 --> 00:13:32.444 line:95%,end
There's a world record,
continuous pirouettes.

00:13:32.511 --> 00:13:34.113 line:95%,end
So, is she a world record holder?

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:36.115 line:95%,end
She consistently can break the record.

00:13:36.182 --> 00:13:37.850 line:95%,end
<i>Look, all these girls are really good.</i>

00:13:37.917 --> 00:13:38.951 line:95%,end
They're all stars.

00:13:39.018 --> 00:13:42.788 line:5%,start
Jaclyn's trying really hard to come across
as the picture-perfect mom,

00:13:42.855 --> 00:13:45.691 line:95%,end
and the dance mom who doesn't
get involved in all the drama,

00:13:45.758 --> 00:13:48.294 line:95%,end
but I have friends in California, too,

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.262 line:95%,end
and they have warned me about her.

00:13:50.329 --> 00:13:51.630 line:95%,end
She's not all she seems.

00:13:51.697 --> 00:13:53.966 line:95%,end
I read some of the things
that you wrote online

00:13:54.033 --> 00:13:57.336 line:95%,end
about a little girl named Mia in Miami,
and it wasn't very kind.

00:13:57.403 --> 00:13:59.772 line:95%,end
So I'm glad that you're at least
being kind to our children.

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:01.273 line:95%,end
I would never write anything about Mia.

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:04.310 line:95%,end
Oh, it was written from you
about a little girl in Miami

00:14:04.376 --> 00:14:06.078 line:95%,end
who you said-- who is amazing--

00:14:06.178 --> 00:14:07.813 line:95%,end
who you said, "Who cares?

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.048 line:95%,end
"Why another contest about her?

00:14:09.281 --> 00:14:10.349 line:95%,end
"She's not even that good."

00:14:10.449 --> 00:14:11.951 line:95%,end
- I didn't write that.
- So I'm just grateful...

00:14:12.184 --> 00:14:14.854 line:95%,end
Well, okay, then I must
have faulty reading.

00:14:14.954 --> 00:14:16.322 line:95%,end
No, I heard that, too, actually.

00:14:16.388 --> 00:14:19.225 line:95%,end
Yeah, but you know, you hear a lot
of things, but that's not true.

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:22.595 line:5%,start
ABBY LEE: Chloe, listen to me.

00:14:22.661 --> 00:14:25.164 line:95%,end
The name of the music is "Another Girl."

00:14:25.231 --> 00:14:27.433 line:95%,end
Whether the other girl's in your mind,

00:14:27.499 --> 00:14:28.767 line:95%,end
whether she really exists,

00:14:28.834 --> 00:14:30.536 line:95%,end
whether it's you...

00:14:30.603 --> 00:14:32.538 line:95%,end
I know Chloe can relate to this.

00:14:32.605 --> 00:14:35.174 line:95%,end
This song, "Another Girl,"
is about being left


00:14:35.241 --> 00:14:38.711 line:95%,end
in the shadows of some kid
that's famous and popular.

00:14:38.777 --> 00:14:41.347 line:95%,end
First it was Maddie, now it's Sophia.

00:14:41.413 --> 00:14:44.083 line:95%,end
Up, ball change, step up.

00:14:44.683 --> 00:14:47.753 line:95%,end
Okay.
You got that? All right, I'll be back.

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:50.923 line:95%,end
I have an acro private, but I'll come
back during the whole break. Okay?

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:52.791 line:95%,end
Abby's already made it abundantly clear

00:14:52.858 --> 00:14:54.660 line:95%,end
that Sophia's the only person
that matters,

00:14:54.727 --> 00:14:58.797 line:95%,end
but to cut Chloe's solo rehearsal short
to have an acro private with Sophia

00:14:58.864 --> 00:15:00.566 line:95%,end
is simply below the belt.

00:15:00.633 --> 00:15:03.269 line:95%,end
<i>Abby thinks she's an amazing superstar,</i>

00:15:03.335 --> 00:15:04.803 line:95%,end
and she loves her,
and they have this great relationship,

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:07.539 line:95%,end
and she's a breath of fresh air,
blah, blah, blah,

00:15:07.606 --> 00:15:10.743 line:95%,end
but our kids have been
beaten down for years.

00:15:10.809 --> 00:15:14.880 line:95%,end
I think this is one week
that Melissa and Maddie are thinking,

00:15:14.947 --> 00:15:17.082 line:95%,end
- "Thank God."
- "Thank God, I don't have a solo."

00:15:17.149 --> 00:15:19.451 line:5%,start
Melissa and Abby are buddy-buddy,

00:15:19.518 --> 00:15:23.923 line:5%,start
and everybody knows that Melissa
will do whatever it takes

00:15:23.989 --> 00:15:26.292 line:95%,end
to have her kids number one
in Abby's eyes.

00:15:26.458 --> 00:15:29.228 line:95%,end
Oh, yeah, that is over, Chloe.

00:15:29.528 --> 00:15:31.997 line:95%,end
âª

00:15:33.232 --> 00:15:34.633 line:95%,end
What are you people doing?

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.336 line:95%,end
I've probably cleaned this place out
12 times 'cause it was filthy.

00:15:37.403 --> 00:15:38.904 line:95%,end
Being Abby's slaves?

00:15:38.971 --> 00:15:41.006 line:95%,end
And Melissa, you're taking out garbage?

00:15:41.073 --> 00:15:42.808 line:95%,end
I always do anyway, even when I do...

00:15:42.875 --> 00:15:45.177 line:95%,end
Melissa, don't take out the garbage.

00:15:45.244 --> 00:15:47.446 line:95%,end
- I always did.
- Don't.

00:15:47.513 --> 00:15:49.581 line:95%,end
MELISSA:<i> Maddie and Mackenzie</i>
<i>were always Abby's favorite.</i>

00:15:49.648 --> 00:15:51.216 line:95%,end
And if I have to take the trash out

00:15:51.283 --> 00:15:54.820 line:95%,end
or clean outside,
um, I'm fine with that because

00:15:54.887 --> 00:15:56.689 line:95%,end
<i>I just don't want Abby</i>
<i>to be mad at us anymore.</i>

00:15:56.755 --> 00:15:59.458 line:95%,end
Back walkover to one knee.
Simple.

00:16:00.592 --> 00:16:02.361 line:95%,end
[squeaky]
Arms up by your ears.

00:16:02.428 --> 00:16:05.097 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: We need to do
some sort of initiation at competition.

00:16:05.164 --> 00:16:06.265 line:95%,end
Like what?

00:16:06.332 --> 00:16:08.000 line:95%,end
<i>Well, she's really good like,</i>
<i>she's good at guarding.</i>

00:16:08.067 --> 00:16:09.201 line:95%,end
<i>Like, Jill, I could get a little at,</i>

00:16:09.268 --> 00:16:11.236 line:95%,end
you know, and she'd...
[speaks gibberish]

00:16:11.904 --> 00:16:15.474 line:95%,end
This one's a little bit more like,
she's well-practiced.

00:16:15.541 --> 00:16:18.510 line:95%,end
I think everyone here is a little annoyed
that Jackie waltzes in, you know,

00:16:18.577 --> 00:16:20.346 line:95%,end
with her perfect little dancer
and their perfect little costumes,

00:16:20.412 --> 00:16:21.613 line:95%,end
and their perfect little makeup.

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.682 line:95%,end
I don't think anybody
would be overly annoyed

00:16:23.749 --> 00:16:26.118 line:95%,end
if they packed up their perfect
little suitcases and hit the road.

00:16:26.185 --> 00:16:28.220 line:95%,end
I don't know what we could do.

00:16:28.287 --> 00:16:29.855 line:95%,end
I'm not good at that kind of stuff.

00:16:29.922 --> 00:16:32.191 line:95%,end
Oh, we could put E-6000
in her eyelash glue

00:16:32.257 --> 00:16:33.559 line:95%,end
'cause she's wearing eyelashes.

00:16:33.625 --> 00:16:35.227 line:95%,end
Oh, my God, we can't do that.

00:16:35.294 --> 00:16:37.363 line:95%,end
My God, she could go blind.

00:16:37.629 --> 00:16:40.599 line:95%,end
I want her to be a triple threat
and then some.

00:16:40.666 --> 00:16:42.501 line:95%,end
What can we do to her?

00:16:42.568 --> 00:16:45.170 line:95%,end
She's gonna do tumbling,
she's gonna do acrobatics,

00:16:45.237 --> 00:16:46.705 line:95%,end
she's gonna do contortion work.

00:16:46.772 --> 00:16:48.007 line:95%,end
We could roofie her drink.

00:16:48.073 --> 00:16:50.042 line:95%,end
Oh, God! No!

00:16:50.376 --> 00:16:52.077 line:95%,end
My God! You're mean!

00:16:52.144 --> 00:16:54.380 line:95%,end
<i>I'm not gonna, like,</i>
<i>roofie her and have her have to go</i>

00:16:54.446 --> 00:16:56.315 line:95%,end
<i>to the hospital and get her</i>
<i>stomach pumped.</i>

00:16:57.049 --> 00:16:58.217 line:95%,end
You're evil!

00:16:59.318 --> 00:17:02.221 line:95%,end
Maybe I'm just going 'cause
I've been roofied before.


00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:07.860 line:5%,start
ABBY LEE:<i> Girls...</i>

00:17:07.926 --> 00:17:10.329 line:5%,start
you're supposed to be in A.
Gianna's already in there. Let's go.

00:17:10.396 --> 00:17:12.264 line:95%,end
Come on. I don't know why you're
acting like it's a picnic.

00:17:12.331 --> 00:17:15.801 line:95%,end
We're gonna be on a bus in a few hours,
going to a competition.

00:17:15.868 --> 00:17:18.370 line:5%,start
I am really nervous about this week's
competition.

00:17:18.437 --> 00:17:21.106 line:95%,end
<i>To get five kids who have been</i>
<i>sitting in a parking lot</i>

00:17:21.173 --> 00:17:23.976 line:95%,end
back in the studio and back in sync
with each other,

00:17:24.043 --> 00:17:25.344 line:95%,end
that is my goal.

00:17:25.411 --> 00:17:27.513 line:95%,end
And right now, they're all over the place.

00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:30.149 line:95%,end
So I guess Abby didn't get
a good night's sleep.

00:17:30.215 --> 00:17:32.017 line:95%,end
<i>She was a little crabby this morning.</i>

00:17:32.084 --> 00:17:33.819 line:95%,end
I think Abby needs more
than a good night's sleep.

00:17:33.886 --> 00:17:35.120 line:95%,end
She needs a good roll in the hay!

00:17:35.187 --> 00:17:37.322 line:95%,end
That's exactly what I'm saying, Jill.

00:17:37.389 --> 00:17:40.592 line:95%,end
Ribs right, left. Right, left.

00:17:40.659 --> 00:17:42.161 line:95%,end
Is Abby married now?

00:17:42.227 --> 00:17:43.395 line:95%,end
[laughs]

00:17:43.462 --> 00:17:46.632 line:95%,end
I said, "Maybe if Abby was thin,
she could find a man,"

00:17:46.698 --> 00:17:50.002 line:95%,end
and Kelly's response was,
"It doesn't matter how thin she is,

00:17:50.069 --> 00:17:51.070 line:95%,end
"she's still a giant bitch."

00:17:51.136 --> 00:17:52.137 line:95%,end
Oh!

00:17:52.204 --> 00:17:54.273 line:95%,end
KELLY: I think
Abby's actually very pretty.

00:17:54.373 --> 00:17:56.542 line:95%,end
- She... Yeah.
- It's her... it's her attitude.

00:17:56.608 --> 00:17:58.277 line:95%,end
Gianna, do you think
you can run up and tell

00:17:58.343 --> 00:18:00.312 line:95%,end
Sophia's mom that I really
want her to watch

00:18:00.379 --> 00:18:02.081 line:95%,end
and not be chitchatting
with the other moms?

00:18:02.681 --> 00:18:06.552 line:95%,end
I think that Sophia has been sent to me
by the dance Gods.

00:18:06.618 --> 00:18:10.589 line:95%,end
My moms drove one kid after another
away from my company.

00:18:10.656 --> 00:18:14.093 line:95%,end
<i>I've had it. It's not gonna</i>
<i>happen with these new moms.</i>

00:18:14.159 --> 00:18:15.627 line:95%,end
Not on my watch.

00:18:15.694 --> 00:18:17.196 line:95%,end
Would you want to live with her?

00:18:17.262 --> 00:18:20.299 line:95%,end
Abby just wanted to make sure that you
were watching the warm-up.

00:18:20.365 --> 00:18:22.468 line:95%,end
Okay. All right. Thank you.

00:18:22.534 --> 00:18:24.069 line:95%,end
All right, Sophia, you're up.

00:18:24.136 --> 00:18:25.938 line:95%,end

ABBY LEE:<i> This number is jam-packed</i>
<i>full of difficulty.</i>

00:18:35.848 --> 00:18:39.918 line:95%,end
And Sophia uses that face,
she uses that style

00:18:39.985 --> 00:18:42.488 line:95%,end
she hits every accent in the music.

00:18:43.355 --> 00:18:46.125 line:95%,end
Really have to stretch that knee.
Feel like I'm pulling it.

00:18:47.993 --> 00:18:50.662 line:95%,end
MADDIE:<i> It's kind of hard not to be</i>
<i>jealous of her when I watch her</i>

00:18:50.729 --> 00:18:52.431 line:95%,end
<i>because even though she's my age...</i>

00:18:52.498 --> 00:18:55.067 line:95%,end
she can do 54 turns, and I can't.

00:18:55.134 --> 00:18:58.570 line:95%,end
So, do you get up every morning and do
the stretches before she goes to school?

00:18:58.637 --> 00:18:59.705 line:95%,end
She goes to homeschool.

00:18:59.771 --> 00:19:01.773 line:95%,end
- I know, but you take her to school?
- I do, yeah.

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:03.809 line:95%,end
Right now, we're going
Mondays and Fridays.

00:19:03.876 --> 00:19:05.444 line:95%,end
That's all you have to go to school,
two days?

00:19:05.511 --> 00:19:06.578 line:95%,end
Between two to four, yeah.

00:19:06.645 --> 00:19:08.413 line:95%,end
You're killing me over here.

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.382 line:95%,end
- Holly's the educator.
- I know.

00:19:10.449 --> 00:19:12.851 line:95%,end
<i>I will make sure we have at least</i>
<i>two hours before we go to dance.</i>

00:19:12.918 --> 00:19:14.686 line:95%,end
So, like, if she goes to school
from 9:00 to 11:00,

00:19:14.753 --> 00:19:16.088 line:95%,end
then I'll get her home by 11:30,

00:19:16.155 --> 00:19:18.190 line:95%,end
and then she stretches from 11:30 to 1:30

00:19:18.257 --> 00:19:20.025 line:95%,end
and we'll have a 2:00 rehearsal.

00:19:20.092 --> 00:19:21.093 line:95%,end
Every day.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.195 line:95%,end
Sophia only goes to school
two hours a week.

00:19:23.262 --> 00:19:26.932 line:95%,end
<i>Our girls actually go to school full-time,</i>
<i>and then they come to dance.</i>

00:19:26.999 --> 00:19:28.700 line:95%,end
It's kinda sad.

00:19:28.767 --> 00:19:30.469 line:95%,end
Thanks for doing your turns for us.

00:19:30.536 --> 00:19:32.137 line:95%,end
- Yep.
- I appreciate it.

00:19:32.204 --> 00:19:33.539 line:95%,end
I'm really serious.

00:19:33.605 --> 00:19:35.908 line:95%,end
I think that I'm gonna ask you
and your mom

00:19:35.974 --> 00:19:39.578 line:95%,end
if you could do a senior
company turn class.

00:19:39.645 --> 00:19:41.446 line:95%,end
When I... but...

00:19:41.513 --> 00:19:43.949 line:95%,end
sometimes I'll teach
the little kids at our studio,

00:19:44.016 --> 00:19:45.784 line:95%,end
and I'm really mean to them.

00:19:45.851 --> 00:19:47.553 line:95%,end
- You're really mean?
- Yeah.

00:19:47.619 --> 00:19:48.620 line:95%,end
I like mean.

00:19:49.221 --> 00:19:50.489 line:95%,end
I'm really mean, too.

Yes?

Now the least their mothers can do

Where are the counts for the pictures?

00:20:06.471 --> 00:20:08.907 line:95%,end
We didn't count them
because you have staff members

00:20:08.974 --> 00:20:10.776 line:95%,end
that you pay to do your job.

00:20:10.842 --> 00:20:13.045 line:95%,end
We pay you to teach our kids dance.

Christi, can you really not
count that high?

00:20:15.414 --> 00:20:16.815 line:95%,end
No, I can't, Abby.

00:20:16.882 --> 00:20:18.717 line:95%,end
See? I'm the product of a public school.

00:20:18.784 --> 00:20:19.985 line:95%,end
Good thing I wasn't homeschooled.

00:20:20.052 --> 00:20:21.987 line:95%,end
I wouldn't be able to even count to ten.

KELLY: Oh, my God, like,
Christi is not giving up on Jackie.

She's calling her out

âª The days are shorter... âª

00:20:37.069 --> 00:20:39.905 line:95%,end
She's choreographing again,
30 minutes before we get on the bus.

I did not realize that.
I thought it was finished.

00:20:42.274 --> 00:20:43.475 line:5%,start
That gives me anxiety.

No, no, we learn on the day we leave.

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:46.511 line:95%,end
- In this case...
- Hello.

00:20:46.578 --> 00:20:48.580 line:95%,end
My daughter's learning her solo
<i>when we're going to get on a bus.</i>

00:20:48.647 --> 00:20:51.917 line:95%,end
It's not three days before,
it's the day of.

00:20:51.984 --> 00:20:53.919 line:95%,end
<i>Abby is clearing setting Chloe up to fail.</i>

00:20:54.052 --> 00:20:56.955 line:5%,start
She knows that none of the girls
on our team

00:20:57.022 --> 00:20:59.157 line:95%,end
are even at the same level as Sophia.

00:20:59.291 --> 00:21:02.227 line:5%,start
âª âª

00:21:02.794 --> 00:21:04.463 line:95%,end
Shoulders down!

00:21:05.364 --> 00:21:06.632 line:95%,end
My daughter looks defeated.

00:21:07.199 --> 00:21:08.700 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Why is she...
Do you think she's upset?

00:21:08.767 --> 00:21:10.335 line:95%,end
Yeah, I know she is.
Look at her. She's trying...

00:21:10.402 --> 00:21:11.770 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Yep. She's fighting it.

00:21:12.738 --> 00:21:14.773 line:95%,end
CHLOE: I'm feeling pressure
to go up against Sophia

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.241 line:95%,end
since she's a very good dancer.

00:21:16.308 --> 00:21:18.143 line:95%,end
Now I feel like I have to work
especially hard

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:19.778 line:95%,end
so that I don't let down the group.

00:21:21.413 --> 00:21:22.748 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: Took what out on you?


00:21:27.386 --> 00:21:28.820 line:95%,end
I'm sorry that you get the brunt.

00:21:28.887 --> 00:21:30.656 line:95%,end
I'm sorry that all of you guys
get the brunt of it.

00:21:30.722 --> 00:21:32.057 line:95%,end
You don't deserve it. You're little girls.

00:21:32.124 --> 00:21:35.027 line:95%,end
I am sorry that Abby takes out
her anger with me on you.

00:21:35.093 --> 00:21:36.161 line:95%,end
That's not fair.

00:21:36.228 --> 00:21:38.030 line:95%,end
Abby, I hate to break it to you,

00:21:38.096 --> 00:21:41.867 line:95%,end
But if you really have a problem
with us not doing all your little tasks,

00:21:41.933 --> 00:21:44.536 line:95%,end
you need to come to us and stop sending
messages through our children.

00:21:44.603 --> 00:21:46.238 line:95%,end
Don't go in the den and sit and talk.

00:21:46.305 --> 00:21:49.741 line:95%,end
If you can't control your own mouth,
come into A and start working.

00:21:49.808 --> 00:21:51.610 line:95%,end
Gianna was in here that
whole time waiting for you.

00:21:51.677 --> 00:21:54.313 line:95%,end
And you're in the den, sitting,
talking... [gibbering]

00:21:54.379 --> 00:21:56.014 line:95%,end
You're gonna be going to a competition

00:21:56.081 --> 00:21:58.483 line:95%,end
where there's some of the best schools
you ever compete against.

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:02.821 line:95%,end
People that did the group dance
are not good enough.

00:22:02.888 --> 00:22:05.991 line:5%,start
So you need to step up your game
or bow out gracefully.

00:22:06.058 --> 00:22:07.592 line:95%,end
They look nervous to me.

00:22:07.659 --> 00:22:08.760 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Yeah. You know what?

00:22:08.827 --> 00:22:10.662 line:95%,end
I thought so, too, from the get-go.

00:22:10.729 --> 00:22:13.432 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Yeah, there's something going
on out there 'cause they're all like...

00:22:13.732 --> 00:22:14.733 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: Moms!

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:15.867 line:95%,end
- Oh, geez.
- Oh, my God.

00:22:15.934 --> 00:22:16.935 line:95%,end
I don't want to judge.

00:22:17.002 --> 00:22:19.771 line:95%,end
The kids look horrible.

00:22:20.539 --> 00:22:22.808 line:95%,end
<i>They can't even do the</i>
<i>choreography I'm giving them.</i>

00:22:23.709 --> 00:22:26.311 line:95%,end
And I have way too many kids
in this number. It's a mess.

00:22:26.378 --> 00:22:28.280 line:95%,end
There are too many people in this dance.

00:22:28.347 --> 00:22:30.682 line:95%,end
We are auditioning for this routine.

00:22:30.749 --> 00:22:32.918 line:95%,end
You're gonna play casting director.

00:22:33.585 --> 00:22:38.323 line:95%,end
So you are looking for the best team
to go out on stage and do this routine.

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:40.292 line:95%,end
<i>She cuts Maddie and Mackenzie--</i>

00:22:40.359 --> 00:22:42.127 line:95%,end
I think they're gonna be devastated.

00:22:42.561 --> 00:22:45.230 line:95%,end
If you're casting a five-year-old,

00:22:45.297 --> 00:22:47.199 line:95%,end
maybe you're just gonna keep Mackenzie.

00:22:47.265 --> 00:22:50.936 line:95%,end
If you're casting<i> The Lion King,</i>

00:22:51.236 --> 00:22:53.271 line:95%,end
maybe the only one you're gonna
keep is Nia.

00:22:55.941 --> 00:22:58.543 line:95%,end
Here we go again with Abby
typecasting Nia.

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:02.047 line:95%,end
Are they drawing your eye
because they were amazing,

00:23:02.114 --> 00:23:03.982 line:95%,end
or are they drawing your eye
because they were late

00:23:04.049 --> 00:23:05.050 line:95%,end
or they were sloppy?

00:23:05.117 --> 00:23:08.720 line:5%,start
Of course, anybody watching
their own daughters dance

00:23:08.787 --> 00:23:10.355 line:95%,end
are gonna pick their daughters.

00:23:10.422 --> 00:23:11.857 line:95%,end
They have them on this team

00:23:11.923 --> 00:23:13.558 line:95%,end
because they want them to compete.

00:23:14.292 --> 00:23:15.861 line:95%,end
So of course we're not gonna
tell you to take our kid

00:23:15.927 --> 00:23:17.929 line:95%,end
out of the group dance
for the competition.

00:23:17.996 --> 00:23:19.097 line:95%,end
I mean, we'd be stupid.

00:23:19.264 --> 00:23:23.235 line:5%,start
âª âª

00:23:24.903 --> 00:23:27.706 line:95%,end
âª

00:23:27.906 --> 00:23:30.976 line:95%,end
Christi could not...

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:33.512 line:95%,end
would not...

00:23:33.912 --> 00:23:35.614 line:95%,end
look at Sophia.

00:23:36.648 --> 00:23:38.784 line:95%,end
Christi, if you want to sit
there and not watch that kid

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:42.788 line:95%,end
and pretend that she doesn't exist,
that's stupid.

00:23:42.854 --> 00:23:44.356 line:95%,end
- That's stupid.
- I was watching.

00:23:44.423 --> 00:23:46.091 line:95%,end
You can't command where my eyeballs went.

00:23:46.158 --> 00:23:47.459 line:95%,end
I don't want to command anything.

00:23:47.526 --> 00:23:50.195 line:95%,end
I'm just telling you that you're foolish
not to learn from people

00:23:50.262 --> 00:23:51.563 line:95%,end
that are better than you.

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:53.231 line:95%,end
That's how you get better.

00:23:53.298 --> 00:23:56.134 line:95%,end
Brooke, you just seem like
a day late and a dollar short.

00:23:56.201 --> 00:23:58.236 line:95%,end
Maddie, I think before Sophia was here,

00:23:58.303 --> 00:23:59.938 line:95%,end
you hit those accents.

00:24:00.872 --> 00:24:02.641 line:95%,end
Mackenzie, it's fine.

00:24:02.707 --> 00:24:05.811 line:95%,end
It's good. It's on par.

00:24:07.712 --> 00:24:09.581 line:95%,end
I need to think about
what's best for the group.

00:24:09.648 --> 00:24:13.151 line:95%,end
If I ask each of your mothers who they
think should be in the dance first,

00:24:13.218 --> 00:24:15.253 line:95%,end
they're all gonna say each of your names.

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:18.857 line:95%,end
Even though they may think differently,
they're gonna go with their own kid.

00:24:18.924 --> 00:24:21.493 line:95%,end
They cannot be objective, can you?

00:24:22.427 --> 00:24:23.428 line:95%,end
No.

00:24:24.596 --> 00:24:26.598 line:5%,start
Brooke, you're out.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.468 line:95%,end
KELLY: Mackenzie's smaller than them,

00:24:29.534 --> 00:24:32.103 line:95%,end
and she's not at the same
technical level as them.

00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:34.773 line:95%,end
So, to me, it would only make
sense to get rid of Mackenzie.

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:37.976 line:95%,end
But of course, she's gonna get rid
of my kid because she hates me.

00:24:38.043 --> 00:24:39.544 line:95%,end
I just want to let y'all know

00:24:39.611 --> 00:24:41.913 line:95%,end
I think some of your kids are in a little
bit of trouble this weekend.

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:43.815 line:95%,end
We're getting on a bus.

00:24:43.882 --> 00:24:45.417 line:95%,end
We are going to a competition.

00:24:45.484 --> 00:24:49.054 line:95%,end
There are going to be people there
doing their routines from last year.

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:51.756 line:95%,end
Everyone is out to beat
the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:24:51.823 --> 00:24:53.325 line:95%,end
I don't think Sophia should be worried.

00:24:53.391 --> 00:24:55.827 line:95%,end
I think that group dance
should be worried.

00:24:55.894 --> 00:24:58.129 line:95%,end
I think the soloist should be worried.

00:24:58.196 --> 00:25:00.599 line:95%,end
HOLLY: I think it's been a very tense
few days.

00:25:00.665 --> 00:25:02.567 line:95%,end
Your fault. Your fault. Your fault.

00:25:02.634 --> 00:25:04.402 line:95%,end
- No.
- Your fault. Your fault. Yes.

00:25:04.469 --> 00:25:07.372 line:95%,end
Maybe if Abby hadn't replaced
Brooke and Paige, you know,

00:25:07.439 --> 00:25:08.640 line:95%,end
we wouldn't have had to protest.

00:25:08.707 --> 00:25:10.342 line:95%,end
We wouldn't have had to sit
in the parking lot.

00:25:10.509 --> 00:25:12.410 line:95%,end
She wouldn't have had to bring
in a replacement team,

00:25:12.477 --> 00:25:14.112 line:95%,end
and our girls would be prepared this week.

00:25:14.546 --> 00:25:18.650 line:95%,end
I think everyone here is thankful
for the experience that they have had

00:25:18.717 --> 00:25:20.285 line:95%,end
and for the dance training.
Our children dance.

00:25:20.352 --> 00:25:21.786 line:95%,end
They don't know how lucky they are.

00:25:21.853 --> 00:25:24.823 line:95%,end
But pointing fingers right now is really
not getting us anywhere,

00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:27.459 line:95%,end
and trying to belittle children
by saying they're ungrateful...

00:25:27.526 --> 00:25:28.593 line:95%,end
- They are.
- They are not.

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:30.328 line:95%,end
- They don't even know what they have.
- That's-that's...

00:25:30.395 --> 00:25:31.763 line:95%,end
I don't need to belittle your children.

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:33.198 line:95%,end
They do it all on their own.

00:25:33.265 --> 00:25:34.332 line:95%,end
Shut your mouth!

00:25:35.467 --> 00:25:38.603 line:95%,end
We have pulled out miracles
making these kids look good.

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:39.738 line:95%,end
Let's just go.

00:25:39.804 --> 00:25:42.040 line:95%,end
Let's stop fighting and try to be a team
just for this weekend.

00:25:42.574 --> 00:25:44.976 line:95%,end
You came in at a really tense time.

Hey! Thank you for coming! Thank you!

00:25:59.858 --> 00:26:02.093 line:95%,end
Whoa.

<i>I'm nervous,</i>

We're going back to In10sity Dance,

00:26:06.865 --> 00:26:08.767 line:5%,start
but it's in Ohio.

00:26:08.833 --> 00:26:11.403 line:95%,end
<i>Some of the toughest schools</i>

00:26:11.469 --> 00:26:14.839 line:95%,end
<i>and we're coming in with</i>
<i>a brand-new number with a new dancer.</i>

00:26:14.906 --> 00:26:16.608 line:95%,end
Am I out of my mind?

00:26:16.675 --> 00:26:18.877 line:95%,end
Yes, some would say

00:26:18.944 --> 00:26:21.012 line:95%,end
that I am out of my mind.

00:26:21.613 --> 00:26:23.014 line:95%,end
Girls, listen.

00:26:23.081 --> 00:26:28.820 line:95%,end
Those kids recognize you
because you are national champions.

00:26:28.887 --> 00:26:30.322 line:95%,end
Do you understand that?

00:26:30.388 --> 00:26:32.223 line:95%,end
If you were the losers,

00:26:33.124 --> 00:26:34.526 line:95%,end
I don't think a thousand people

00:26:34.593 --> 00:26:36.895 line:95%,end
would be downstairs to get
your autograph and your picture.

00:26:36.962 --> 00:26:41.833 line:95%,end
This team needs to get right back
to that same exact place

Sophia, come on. Get out here.

All right? So be that superstar.

00:27:17.102 --> 00:27:18.703 line:95%,end
Step out there and own that stage.

Got it?

MELISSA: This is a really
strange competition

for us because Abby's really not paying
attention to any of our children.

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:26.411 line:95%,end

and I think that that sincerity

[applause]

00:35:50.314 --> 00:35:54.585 line:95%,end
All right, our elite junior solo division
of competition.

00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:59.857 line:95%,end
Fourth place with a score of 277 points
is Miss Delaney

00:35:59.924 --> 00:36:01.859 line:95%,end
with act number 28, "Move Your Feet."

00:36:03.861 --> 00:36:06.130 line:5%,start
Your second runner-up,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:36:06.197 --> 00:36:09.867 line:5%,start
with a score of 281.3 points...

00:36:11.836 --> 00:36:12.837 line:95%,end
...is...

00:36:13.237 --> 00:36:15.239 line:95%,end
[intense music]

00:36:16.107 --> 00:36:19.577 line:95%,end
...Miss Chloe with act number 25
"Another Girl."

00:36:20.378 --> 00:36:22.180 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: I'm a little surprised
Chloe got second runner-up--

00:36:22.246 --> 00:36:24.515 line:5%,start
I thought she was beautiful
and elegant on stage,

00:36:24.582 --> 00:36:27.351 line:5%,start
but considering that Abby
only paid attention to Sophia this week,

00:36:27.418 --> 00:36:28.586 line:95%,end
I'm really proud of Chloe.

00:36:28.653 --> 00:36:31.889 line:95%,end
Highest scoring elite junior soloist

00:36:31.956 --> 00:36:34.959 line:95%,end
with a score of 284.1 points

00:36:35.159 --> 00:36:38.696 line:5%,start
is Miss Sophia
with act number 18 "Superstar."

00:36:38.763 --> 00:36:41.465 line:5%,start
ABBY LEE: There was no doubt
in my mind that Sophia

00:36:41.532 --> 00:36:42.667 line:5%,start
would win this whole thing.

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:46.437 line:95%,end
If the dance team wants
to beat somebody like Sophia,

00:36:46.504 --> 00:36:48.072 line:95%,end
they'd better get busy.


00:36:48.472 --> 00:36:51.142 line:5%,start
ANNOUNCER: Okay, so the judges
selected routines that they just

00:36:51.209 --> 00:36:53.110 line:95%,end
really loved from the day.

00:36:56.214 --> 00:36:57.315 line:95%,end
Hi, everybody.

00:36:57.381 --> 00:37:00.718 line:95%,end
There's something so humble
and heartwarming about this dancer

00:37:00.985 --> 00:37:06.257 line:95%,end
and I hope she never, ever, ever loses it
because it's very, very special.

00:37:09.227 --> 00:37:11.162 line:95%,end
This is to another girl,

00:37:11.229 --> 00:37:12.363 line:95%,end
Chloe.

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:14.498 line:95%,end
[cheering]

00:37:14.665 --> 00:37:18.736 line:5%,start
CHLOE: One judge specifically gave me
an expressive heart award.

00:37:18.803 --> 00:37:20.972 line:5%,start
And that was something really special,

00:37:21.038 --> 00:37:23.808 line:95%,end
and it was a really good moment for me.

00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:30.348 line:5%,start
My job as a mom is to raise
someone that I not only love

00:37:30.414 --> 00:37:33.351 line:95%,end
but I like-- and I really like
the person that Chloe is.

00:37:34.352 --> 00:37:37.588 line:95%,end
To me, that's more important than
any first place trophy ever.

00:37:40.024 --> 00:37:43.094 line:5%,start
ANNOUNCER: We're jumping
right into elite junior small group.

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:44.762 line:5%,start
KELLY: I'm really nervous
for the group number.

00:37:44.829 --> 00:37:45.830 line:95%,end
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen,

00:37:45.896 --> 00:37:49.100 line:95%,end
your highest scoring
elite junior small group...

00:37:49.166 --> 00:37:55.072 line:5%,start
KELLY: I just want first place so we can
look at Abby and say, "We're your team."

00:37:55.139 --> 00:37:59.110 line:95%,end
With a score of 280.8 points...

00:38:01.612 --> 00:38:04.882 line:5%,start
...is act number 38 "Red Carpet Special."

00:38:04.949 --> 00:38:07.952 line:95%,end
[whooping and cheering]

00:38:09.954 --> 00:38:13.291 line:95%,end
Congratulations to all of our
elite junior small groups.

00:38:13.357 --> 00:38:16.661 line:95%,end
We just went and once again
won first place.

00:38:16.727 --> 00:38:17.995 line:95%,end
I just want to make a comment.

00:38:18.062 --> 00:38:20.965 line:95%,end
Last week, the group wasn't here
and they got second.

00:38:21.032 --> 00:38:23.167 line:95%,end
This week, the group was all together

00:38:23.234 --> 00:38:25.269 line:95%,end
âª And we got first! âª

00:38:26.203 --> 00:38:28.306 line:95%,end
- Good job.
- Hey, ladies!

00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:31.208 line:95%,end
- Hey!
- Good job.

00:38:31.275 --> 00:38:32.743 line:95%,end
- Thank you!
- Aw...

00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:35.313 line:95%,end
I was proud of what
the judge said about you.

00:38:35.379 --> 00:38:36.981 line:95%,end
And I'm glad I got third and not second,

00:38:37.048 --> 00:38:40.117 line:95%,end
so that Miss Abby can't say,
"Second is the first to lose."

00:38:43.587 --> 00:38:46.023 line:95%,end
Does somebody care this poor, sad child
and what she just said?

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:48.726 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: It's kind of sad that
the girls can't even work hard

00:38:48.793 --> 00:38:51.662 line:95%,end
and strive for a goal
other than first place.

00:38:53.297 --> 00:38:55.299 line:95%,end
You know, there's more to life
than winning, Ab,

00:38:55.366 --> 00:38:56.901 line:95%,end
and you should know that more than anyone.

00:38:58.302 --> 00:39:00.504 line:95%,end
[whoops] Can we talk
about the group dance?

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:05.142 line:95%,end
I'm glad the judges weren't
looking at all those mistakes.

00:39:06.877 --> 00:39:10.081 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Part of me feels like she
was disappointed that they got first.

00:39:10.314 --> 00:39:15.152 line:95%,end
Sophia, outstanding--
high score of the entire competition.

00:39:15.786 --> 00:39:17.154 line:95%,end
All right, Chloe.

00:39:17.221 --> 00:39:18.656 line:95%,end
Hot mess.

00:39:18.889 --> 00:39:21.559 line:95%,end
Flexibility is getting worse
instead of better.

00:39:21.625 --> 00:39:23.627 line:95%,end
What were you balancing?
Where was the balance?

00:39:23.694 --> 00:39:25.730 line:95%,end
I've never seen you that off
on your turns.

00:39:25.796 --> 00:39:26.831 line:95%,end
Well, you know what, Abby,

00:39:26.897 --> 00:39:29.800 line:95%,end
that's a reflection of you
because Chloe has been your student

00:39:29.867 --> 00:39:31.235 line:95%,end
since she was two years old.

00:39:31.302 --> 00:39:33.704 line:95%,end
Sophia walked in off the street
from someone else two weeks ago<i>.</i>

00:39:33.771 --> 00:39:34.839 line:95%,end
You're not her teacher.

00:39:34.905 --> 00:39:36.707 line:95%,end
You're not stretching her every day.

00:39:36.774 --> 00:39:39.510 line:95%,end
I pay you for her to go
to class and stretch.

00:39:39.577 --> 00:39:42.246 line:95%,end
You know how sometimes
your child takes math at school,

00:39:42.313 --> 00:39:44.849 line:95%,end
but they need a tutor for extra math?

00:39:44.915 --> 00:39:47.918 line:95%,end
Chloe needs extra flexibility at home.

00:39:47.985 --> 00:39:49.887 line:95%,end
Why haven't you ever told me
that before today?

00:39:50.221 --> 00:39:52.423 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: I know that Christi's
annoyed with me

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:56.394 line:95%,end
because I am showering Sophia
with attention, but you know what?

00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:57.528 line:95%,end
You quit.

00:39:57.595 --> 00:39:58.963 line:95%,end
Sophia was there.

00:39:59.063 --> 00:40:00.831 line:95%,end
Chloe is a product of you.

00:40:00.898 --> 00:40:03.567 line:95%,end
She's been at your studio
since she was two.

00:40:03.634 --> 00:40:04.635 line:95%,end
She's lazy.

00:40:04.702 --> 00:40:08.005 line:95%,end
Then why don't you say,
"Do this, this is how you fix it"?

00:40:08.072 --> 00:40:09.073 line:95%,end
She doesn't!

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:10.908 line:95%,end
I'm not a dance teacher,
you tell me every day!

00:40:10.975 --> 00:40:12.910 line:95%,end
Chloe is your student.

00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:15.312 line:95%,end
You are a plagiarist
because that little girl

00:40:15.379 --> 00:40:18.182 line:95%,end
is somebody else's student,
and you just put your name on her back.

00:40:18.249 --> 00:40:21.585 line:95%,end
You're ridiculous. Chloe was awful today.

00:40:23.087 --> 00:40:25.723 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I'm always the first to jump
right back at Abby, you know.

00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:27.725 line:95%,end
I believe in fighting fire with fire.

00:40:27.792 --> 00:40:30.094 line:95%,end
But some of the things
she said about Chloe

00:40:30.161 --> 00:40:31.996 line:95%,end
were just so awful...

00:40:32.062 --> 00:40:35.065 line:95%,end
that it... it just hurt me.

00:40:36.467 --> 00:40:39.136 line:95%,end
She reveled in doing that

00:40:39.303 --> 00:40:41.705 line:95%,end
to an 11-year-old, and she did it...

00:40:41.772 --> 00:40:43.607 line:95%,end
She did it to my...

00:40:43.674 --> 00:40:44.675 line:95%,end
HOLLY: To your baby.

00:40:47.445 --> 00:40:49.380 line:95%,end
[crying]
What are we doing to our kids?

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:51.015 line:95%,end
CAPTIONING PROVIDED BY A+E NETWORKS

00:40:52.716 --> 00:40:54.318 line:5%,start
Sophia is on the top of the pyramid

00:40:54.385 --> 00:40:55.719 line:5%,start
and she is not even here!

00:40:55.886 --> 00:40:57.121 line:5%,start
My next routine

00:40:57.188 --> 00:40:58.589 line:5%,start
will be a duet!

00:40:59.423 --> 00:41:01.325 line:5%,start
With Maddie and Kendall.

00:41:02.226 --> 00:41:04.195 line:5%,start
Abby told me last night that
you weren't happy

00:41:04.261 --> 00:41:05.596 line:5%,start
about doing a duet with Kendall.

00:41:05.796 --> 00:41:07.298 line:5%,start
You can believe
whatever you want to, Jill.

00:41:08.165 --> 00:41:10.034 line:5%,start
[intense music]

00:41:10.167 --> 00:41:12.636 line:5%,start
Maddie will never get her spot back

00:41:12.736 --> 00:41:13.938 line:5%,start
with Sophia...

00:41:14.004 --> 00:41:16.040 line:5%,start
Kendall, are you gonna admit that
you screwed the whole dance up

00:41:16.106 --> 00:41:17.107 line:95%,end
and you were off?

00:41:17.741 --> 00:41:21.579 line:5%,start
And you picked on her
the entire week about it!
