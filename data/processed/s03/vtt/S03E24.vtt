ABBY LEE MILLER:
Previously on "Dance Moms."

00:00:02.902 --> 00:00:05.805 line:5%,start
I need to win, that's why
you guys are here.

00:00:05.872 --> 00:00:07.807 line:5%,start
I want to make a strong team,
and I want to make a strong team

00:00:07.874 --> 00:00:09.142 line:5%,start
with the people that I trust.

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:11.311 line:5%,start
ABBY LEE MILLER: I get reports
that you're kissing

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:14.280 line:5%,start
some guy backstage
before you go on to compete?

00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:15.515 line:5%,start
I hope that was a rumor.

00:00:17.717 --> 00:00:19.019 line:5%,start
What was that we just saw?

00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:20.787 line:5%,start
What was that we just saw?

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:21.988 line:5%,start
You're kidding me!

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:24.024 line:5%,start
In first place, Bad Girls.

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:26.459 line:5%,start
And how old are you, double chin?

00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:28.428 line:5%,start
Watch your ugly mouth.

00:00:28.495 --> 00:00:29.929 line:5%,start
Vicky, you have to go.

00:00:29.996 --> 00:00:31.765 line:5%,start
I don't want you to hear
rumors, blah blah blah,

00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:35.135 line:5%,start
but I am looking for property in LA.

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:38.238 line:5%,start
Coming up on "Dance Moms."

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:39.406 line:5%,start
We're starting a new ball game.

00:00:39.472 --> 00:00:43.443 line:5%,start
This is our opportunity
to build and get strong.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:44.677 line:5%,start
The Dream Team is here.

00:00:44.744 --> 00:00:46.346 line:5%,start
Abby's in LA.

00:00:46.413 --> 00:00:48.515 line:5%,start
I just want to be one of the
first studios in Pittsburgh

00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:50.183 line:5%,start
to bring this to the students.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.118 line:5%,start
Believe it or not,
there's a lot of personalities

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:53.186 line:5%,start
like Abby in LA.

00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:54.421 line:5%,start
Drag Queens.

00:00:56.356 --> 00:00:59.659 line:5%,start
Show Anthony, show myself
what you've got to offer.

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:00.894 line:5%,start
Oh [bleep].

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.595 line:5%,start
Put your mouth on vacation.

00:01:02.662 --> 00:01:03.897 line:5%,start
[interposing voices]

[music playing]

00:01:11.504 --> 00:01:14.941 line:95%,end
(SINGING) Get up, get on the floor.

00:01:15.008 --> 00:01:21.481 line:95%,end
My world is with my girls
living on the dance floor.

00:01:21.548 --> 00:01:23.450 line:5%,start
[music playing]

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:26.519 line:5%,start
John, what about the neighborhood?

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:30.457 line:5%,start
I don't miss those kids
back in Pittsburgh at all.

00:01:30.523 --> 00:01:32.692 line:5%,start
They better be in that
studio working with Gianna

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:33.760 line:95%,end
and the rest of my staff--

00:01:33.827 --> 00:01:38.965 line:95%,end
Long lunge again, two arms up
in high fifth, shoulders down.

00:01:39.032 --> 00:01:41.167 line:95%,end
Now my friend John and I
are looking for property.

00:01:41.968 --> 00:01:45.138 line:95%,end
I want to open a studio
here in California.

00:01:48.508 --> 00:01:49.809 line:5%,start
Hello.
How are you?

00:01:49.876 --> 00:01:51.377 line:95%,end
Good, how are you?

00:01:51.478 --> 00:01:52.479 line:95%,end
Fine, thanks.

00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:53.546 line:95%,end
My name is Abby Lee--

00:01:53.613 --> 00:01:54.714 line:95%,end
Sasha.

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:56.149 line:95%,end
We just want to take a look at the space.

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:57.283 line:95%,end
OK, sure.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.551 line:95%,end
I'll give you a walk around.

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:01.921 line:95%,end
This is our pole studio.

00:02:01.988 --> 00:02:04.090 line:95%,end
Oh, my God, there's poles.

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:05.959 line:95%,end
They're poles.
There are eight poles.

00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:08.761 line:95%,end
I'm looking for space
without any poles or columns.

00:02:08.828 --> 00:02:10.763 line:95%,end
Oh, my goodness.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.032 line:95%,end
Kelly would probably
make the best stripper,

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.869 line:95%,end
because A, she started out as a dancer,

00:02:15.935 --> 00:02:20.273 line:95%,end
B, she failed at being a
dancer, and C, she's always

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.441 line:95%,end
taking her clothes off.

00:02:21.508 --> 00:02:24.911 line:95%,end
I just had a structural engineer
come to check out my roof

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:26.112 line:95%,end
to put this up.

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:27.180 line:95%,end
Yes.

00:02:27.247 --> 00:02:29.182 line:95%,end
I just want to be one of the
first studios in Pittsburgh

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:32.585 line:95%,end
to bring this to the students
so that they're multifaceted,

00:02:32.652 --> 00:02:34.420 line:95%,end
because this is the next step.

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:38.024 line:95%,end
More and more often you
see silks, and hammocks,

00:02:38.091 --> 00:02:41.394 line:95%,end
and lires in all the
award shows, and videos,

00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:42.862 line:95%,end
and every cirque show.

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:45.465 line:95%,end
So when I see silks, I get excited.

00:02:45.532 --> 00:02:47.700 line:95%,end
I think the more training a dancer has,

00:02:47.767 --> 00:02:49.869 line:95%,end
the more opportunities
will become available.

00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:52.605 line:95%,end
I'm having silks installed
in my dance studio.

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:56.442 line:95%,end
I love the space up here,
I think I'll definitely be back.

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:59.012 line:95%,end
It might not be to teach
other children though.

00:02:59.078 --> 00:03:01.781 line:95%,end
Maybe I'll just come
back to learn some moves.

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:03.049 line:95%,end
Yes, good.

00:03:03.116 --> 00:03:06.085 line:95%,end
Seeing all these dance
studios in Los Angeles

00:03:06.152 --> 00:03:08.788 line:95%,end
really has me thinking
about making the big move.

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:11.257 line:95%,end
Who knows?
Maybe I'll be here permanently.

00:03:11.324 --> 00:03:13.760 line:95%,end
I'm pretty sure that Maddie
and Mackenzie would follow me

00:03:13.826 --> 00:03:17.397 line:95%,end
right here to California but I'm not
so sure about those other kids.

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:19.699 line:95%,end
[music playing]


00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:24.904 line:5%,start
CATHY: Hey, guys.

00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:26.039 line:5%,start
Hey, Candy.

00:03:26.105 --> 00:03:27.974 line:95%,end
I have to say welcome back.

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:29.042 line:95%,end
Thank you.

00:03:29.108 --> 00:03:31.144 line:95%,end
And I have to say welcome.

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:32.212 line:95%,end
Thank you.

00:03:32.278 --> 00:03:34.013 line:5%,start
After losing to Abby, this is going to be

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.049 line:5%,start
a really intense week for me.

00:03:36.115 --> 00:03:39.018 line:5%,start
I have a whole new team,
I have a whole new everything.

00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:42.121 line:95%,end
I had a horrendous week.

00:03:42.188 --> 00:03:44.924 line:95%,end
We lost to the Abby Lee Dance Company,

00:03:44.991 --> 00:03:48.695 line:95%,end
and quite frankly,
I don't enjoy the feeling

00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:50.163 line:95%,end
that I get when I lose.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.635 line:95%,end
(SINGING) Hey boy, [inaudible].

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.273 line:95%,end
In second place,
entry number 75, Be Strong.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.642 line:95%,end
[cheering and applause]

00:04:04.377 --> 00:04:07.580 line:95%,end
I'm more determined now
to take the country by storm.

00:04:07.647 --> 00:04:10.049 line:95%,end
You know, Candy Apple Town or nothing.

00:04:10.116 --> 00:04:13.486 line:95%,end
Having Cathy invite me here
and bring me here long time.

00:04:13.553 --> 00:04:15.788 line:95%,end
I think it took her
for a while to trust me

00:04:15.855 --> 00:04:17.223 line:95%,end
and to get to know who I am.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.392 line:95%,end
This lady has a lot of
wisdom, she picks up

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.694 line:95%,end
where I left in certain areas sometimes,

00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:25.698 line:95%,end
and I think that's why
we have a great mold together.

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:28.167 line:5%,start
I want to work with Cathy,
because I like a challenge,

00:04:28.234 --> 00:04:29.969 line:5%,start
and Cathy gives me a good challenge.

00:04:30.036 --> 00:04:31.704 line:95%,end
Me and Cathy are rebuilding this team

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:36.476 line:95%,end
so we can be true contenders
and competitors to the Abby Lee

00:04:36.542 --> 00:04:37.877 line:95%,end
Dance Company and my perspective.

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:40.580 line:95%,end
Boys, you've come back,
because you've danced with me

00:04:40.647 --> 00:04:41.648 line:95%,end
for a couple of weeks.

00:04:41.714 --> 00:04:45.551 line:95%,end
Girls, you're new, hand picked.

00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:47.353 line:95%,end
So I've definitely decided
to keep my three boys--

00:04:48.154 --> 00:04:51.024 line:95%,end
I've got Zack, Nick, and Jalen.

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.393 line:95%,end
But I've also invited three new girls.

00:04:54.193 --> 00:04:58.765 line:95%,end
Hadley, you've got star quality,
and I'm so happy to have you here.

00:04:58.831 --> 00:05:01.334 line:95%,end
And you, I'm so happy to have you here.

00:05:01.401 --> 00:05:02.402 line:95%,end
Love your dress, by the way.

00:05:02.468 --> 00:05:03.636 line:95%,end
Thank you.

00:05:03.703 --> 00:05:07.540 line:95%,end
YVETTE: When Cathy called to invite Hadley
to her team, I was thrilled.

00:05:07.607 --> 00:05:11.244 line:5%,start
I think Cathy and I definitely
have the same goal--

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:12.812 line:95%,end
we both want to beat Abby Lee Miller.

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:13.946 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:05:14.013 --> 00:05:16.516 line:95%,end
(SINGING) Don't turn
off your light tonight.

00:05:16.582 --> 00:05:17.617 line:95%,end
[cheering and applause]

00:05:17.684 --> 00:05:18.985 line:95%,end
YVETTE: Abby tried to break Hadley.

00:05:19.052 --> 00:05:20.887 line:95%,end
ANNOUNCER 1: Abby, I'm reading
your facial expression,

00:05:20.953 --> 00:05:23.423 line:95%,end
and you don't seem that happy.

00:05:23.489 --> 00:05:24.857 line:95%,end
Should I say roadkill?

00:05:24.924 --> 00:05:26.359 line:95%,end
[gasping]

00:05:26.426 --> 00:05:29.395 line:95%,end
She wants nothing more
than to go against Abby

00:05:29.462 --> 00:05:32.165 line:95%,end
and show her how much she has improved.

00:05:32.231 --> 00:05:36.469 line:95%,end
I think you're so positive,
and I love Anthony.

00:05:36.536 --> 00:05:38.905 line:95%,end
I think this is the best fit.

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:40.907 line:95%,end
You have some fans.

00:05:40.973 --> 00:05:42.675 line:95%,end
[laughter]

00:05:43.276 --> 00:05:47.046 line:5%,start
CATHY: Campbell, you have
an amazing presence on stage.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.883 line:5%,start
ALLI: Campbell as a dancer has
always been a winner,

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.785 line:5%,start
and people just fall in
love with her for her.

00:05:52.852 --> 00:05:55.021 line:5%,start
Not only her on stage,
but also her off stage.

00:05:55.088 --> 00:05:56.756 line:95%,end
I want Campbell to be
a part of Candy Apples,

00:05:56.823 --> 00:05:59.359 line:95%,end
because Cathy is looking
for her ultimate dream team,

00:05:59.425 --> 00:06:01.160 line:95%,end
and she wants to win.

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:07.200 line:5%,start
Mari, you have amazing extensions,

00:06:07.266 --> 00:06:09.001 line:95%,end
and that's why you were invited.

00:06:09.068 --> 00:06:12.972 line:5%,start
Mari is a title winner, she has a mother

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:14.307 line:95%,end
who's a dance teacher.

00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:16.676 line:95%,end
I want Mari to have the best possible
opportunities

00:06:16.743 --> 00:06:18.845 line:95%,end
in the industry, and I feel that Cathy

00:06:18.911 --> 00:06:20.646 line:95%,end
is a leader in the industry.

00:06:20.713 --> 00:06:23.349 line:95%,end
And if anybody is going to
get my little girl known

00:06:23.416 --> 00:06:26.386 line:95%,end
and can get doors open
for her, it's Cathy.

00:06:26.452 --> 00:06:29.689 line:95%,end
This is a big opportunity for all of you.

00:06:29.756 --> 00:06:32.959 line:95%,end
I don't know who's going
to have a solo this week,

00:06:33.025 --> 00:06:38.131 line:95%,end
I don't know who is going to
have some highlighting done

00:06:38.197 --> 00:06:42.168 line:95%,end
in the group dance,
I don't know any of that until Anthony

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:45.471 line:95%,end
and I start to look at what you can do.


00:06:45.538 --> 00:06:50.576 line:95%,end
So not only am I going to be
looking for a good, solid team

00:06:50.643 --> 00:06:52.712 line:95%,end
to take this nation by storm--

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:55.081 line:95%,end
not to mention Abby who's
as big as the nation--

00:06:58.351 --> 00:07:00.052 line:95%,end
somebody may go home.

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:04.490 line:95%,end
It's not a contest.

00:07:04.557 --> 00:07:06.392 line:95%,end
For me, that is.

00:07:06.459 --> 00:07:08.394 line:95%,end
It could be a contest for all of you.

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:13.032 line:95%,end
But I need to know that you
guys are going to defend me

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:14.700 line:95%,end
come hell or high water.

00:07:14.767 --> 00:07:18.137 line:95%,end
Oops, come H-E double
hockey sticks or water.

00:07:18.204 --> 00:07:22.708 line:95%,end
Usually, I like to work
with uneven numbers.

00:07:22.775 --> 00:07:25.211 line:95%,end
You can always pull out that strong dancer

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:27.079 line:95%,end
and highlight them, and then you're

00:07:27.146 --> 00:07:31.250 line:95%,end
symmetric on either side
with your remaining dancers.

00:07:31.317 --> 00:07:34.020 line:95%,end
So we definitely need
to cut the team down.

00:07:34.086 --> 00:07:38.357 line:95%,end
I'm more serious and more
determined now than ever.

00:07:38.424 --> 00:07:42.662 line:95%,end
You've got to let me know that
this right now is what you want

00:07:42.728 --> 00:07:46.766 line:95%,end
so bad, you can taste it,
and it is sweet like a candy apple.

00:07:47.767 --> 00:07:51.204 line:95%,end
I'm all about fun and
games, but I'm not Abby.

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.806 line:95%,end
We will win, and we will be the best.

[music playing]

00:08:00.847 --> 00:08:01.881 line:95%,end
Well, that was intense.

00:08:01.948 --> 00:08:03.249 line:95%,end
That as so intense.

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:04.383 line:5%,start
So spread out.

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:05.451 line:5%,start
[music playing]

00:08:05.518 --> 00:08:07.353 line:5%,start
Some of this may be [inaudible]
just take a cross and you go,

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:12.692 line:5%,start
from here, you go step, passÃ©.

00:08:12.758 --> 00:08:14.126 line:95%,end
CATHY: The group dance this week is

00:08:14.193 --> 00:08:19.098 line:95%,end
about experiencing boyfriend,
girlfriend, first hand hold,

00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:25.137 line:95%,end
first kiss, first finding out
that you're attracted to someone

00:08:25.204 --> 00:08:29.642 line:95%,end
and have kind of deep feelings for them.

00:08:29.709 --> 00:08:31.878 line:95%,end
From there, just roll over.

00:08:31.944 --> 00:08:34.580 line:95%,end
And this is where I want to
see each of you individually.

00:08:34.647 --> 00:08:37.149 line:95%,end
How humiliating would it be
for your little girl or boy

00:08:37.216 --> 00:08:39.752 line:95%,end
to be the only one to be eliminated.

00:08:39.819 --> 00:08:41.988 line:95%,end
This is so nerve wracking
that we've come this far.

00:08:42.054 --> 00:08:43.956 line:95%,end
I put everything on hold back at home--

00:08:44.023 --> 00:08:46.559 line:95%,end
my businesses, my family.

00:08:46.626 --> 00:08:47.827 line:95%,end
I'm here for Mari.

00:08:47.894 --> 00:08:49.462 line:95%,end
I hope Mari's not the one going home.

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:51.130 line:95%,end
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:54.233 line:95%,end
He's a hip hop dancer,
he spins on his head.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:55.401 line:95%,end
You know, he does a lot
more than spin on his head.

00:08:55.468 --> 00:08:58.104 line:95%,end
My daughter-- does pirouettes, right?

00:08:58.170 --> 00:08:59.238 line:95%,end
OK.

00:08:59.305 --> 00:09:00.740 line:95%,end
You could take somebody off the street

00:09:00.806 --> 00:09:03.709 line:95%,end
and teach them how to
do hip hop street dance.

00:09:03.776 --> 00:09:06.546 line:95%,end
That's like me saying you
can take any kid off the street

00:09:06.612 --> 00:09:07.780 line:95%,end
and teach them how to spin.

00:09:07.847 --> 00:09:08.915 line:95%,end
You can't.

00:09:08.981 --> 00:09:11.817 line:95%,end
GINA D: Jalen is obviously very talented,

00:09:11.884 --> 00:09:16.756 line:95%,end
but present time right now, Mari would
be the more versatile dancer.

00:09:16.822 --> 00:09:18.491 line:95%,end
If anybody is going to
be cut from this team,

00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:19.659 line:95%,end
it should be Jalen.

00:09:19.725 --> 00:09:21.093 line:95%,end
So you can take any kid off the street

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.329 line:95%,end
and teach them how to do ballet then,
right?

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:24.864 line:95%,end
No, you can't.

00:09:24.931 --> 00:09:27.400 line:95%,end
But you can take any kid off the street
and teach what my son does?

00:09:27.466 --> 00:09:28.534 line:95%,end
Yes, you can.

00:09:28.601 --> 00:09:30.403 line:95%,end
So there's no training in break dancing.

00:09:30.469 --> 00:09:32.772 line:95%,end
I can't talk to you, because
now you're fighting with me.

00:09:32.838 --> 00:09:35.408 line:95%,end
And it's like, I'm not saying that, OK?

00:09:35.474 --> 00:09:37.310 line:95%,end
- You're being defensive.
- This conversation is over.

00:09:37.376 --> 00:09:39.579 line:95%,end
- You are being really defensive.
- All right, good.

00:09:39.645 --> 00:09:41.013 line:95%,end
Let's figure it out.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.081 line:95%,end
Rick is a yeller.

00:09:42.148 --> 00:09:43.382 line:95%,end
I don't roll like that.

00:09:43.449 --> 00:09:45.184 line:95%,end
It's out of control.

00:09:45.251 --> 00:09:49.488 line:95%,end
I'm concerned, because we came to be
on a winning team and beat Abby.

00:09:49.555 --> 00:09:50.756 line:95%,end
I just think that some of the parents

00:09:50.823 --> 00:09:52.358 line:95%,end
need to keep their nose
in their own business.

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:54.193 line:95%,end
No, he's crazy.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.963 line:95%,end
Gina-- Gina-- he comes from the streets.

ABBY LEE MILLER: I've decided that
it's time for the Abby Lee Dance Company

00:10:05.404 --> 00:10:09.108 line:5%,start
to expand, so I'm going to check out
some studio spaces

00:10:09.175 --> 00:10:10.910 line:5%,start
in the Los Angeles area.

00:10:10.977 --> 00:10:13.179 line:5%,start
I always wanted to be a Cali girl,

00:10:13.245 --> 00:10:15.848 line:5%,start
and Lord knows I don't want to die
in Pittsburgh.

00:10:15.915 --> 00:10:18.150 line:95%,end
This is our main dance floor,
you can come in here if you like.

00:10:18.217 --> 00:10:19.819 line:95%,end
Ooh.

00:10:19.885 --> 00:10:21.754 line:95%,end
We get a lot of kids in here,
especially during the summer.

00:10:21.821 --> 00:10:23.055 line:95%,end
You do?

00:10:23.122 --> 00:10:24.390 line:95%,end
I wanna check out the mirrors here.

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:26.058 line:95%,end
I love how they go all
the way to the floor.

00:10:26.125 --> 00:10:27.226 line:95%,end
Yes.

00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:30.229 line:95%,end
I'm a big perfectionist
when it comes to feet.

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:33.666 line:95%,end
Other than New York, Los Angeles
is the best market for dance.

00:10:33.733 --> 00:10:36.702 line:95%,end
I want to move to someplace sunnier,

00:10:36.769 --> 00:10:38.537 line:95%,end
nicer, a little more fun.

00:10:38.604 --> 00:10:44.110 line:95%,end
There's plenty of child stars
come to Los Angeles to make it.

00:10:44.176 --> 00:10:45.778 line:95%,end
Certainly they can use my training.

00:10:45.845 --> 00:10:48.014 line:95%,end
- Thank you very much, honey.
- Pleasure meeting you.

00:10:48.814 --> 00:10:51.484 line:5%,start
[music playing]

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:54.420 line:95%,end
Good, and then you need to
get into your press, right?

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:57.289 line:95%,end
I think you just need to roll
this way and get into it.

00:10:57.356 --> 00:10:59.091 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: Even though
I'm away in LA,

00:10:59.158 --> 00:11:03.863 line:95%,end
I've given my faculty
my permission to teach my work.

00:11:03.929 --> 00:11:06.298 line:95%,end
So everybody better be at that studio

00:11:06.365 --> 00:11:09.135 line:95%,end
improving, working, training.

00:11:09.935 --> 00:11:10.970 line:95%,end
Try that.

00:11:11.037 --> 00:11:12.805 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:11:15.841 --> 00:11:17.510 line:95%,end
Hey, what are we going to toast to?

00:11:17.576 --> 00:11:19.445 line:95%,end
Because Abby's in LA.

00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:20.713 line:95%,end
[squealing]

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:22.248 line:95%,end
When is Abby coming back?

00:11:22.314 --> 00:11:23.883 line:95%,end
Oh, God, I don't know.

00:11:23.949 --> 00:11:25.317 line:95%,end
Here's to never coming back.

00:11:25.384 --> 00:11:26.452 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:27.520 line:95%,end
Amen.

00:11:27.586 --> 00:11:29.655 line:95%,end
Melissa, you downed It already.

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:32.124 line:95%,end
She's all like, I don't drink that,

00:11:32.191 --> 00:11:34.326 line:95%,end
she's like [slurping noise].

00:11:34.393 --> 00:11:38.431 line:5%,start
It's such a relief to go
to dance and not have Abby

00:11:38.497 --> 00:11:39.899 line:95%,end
screaming at the kids.

00:11:39.965 --> 00:11:43.636 line:95%,end
It's actually been kind of nice
not having the big shadow

00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:46.105 line:95%,end
hanging over our heads
when we enter the studios.

00:11:46.172 --> 00:11:47.406 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:11:47.473 --> 00:11:50.309 line:95%,end
How in God's good earth is
she going to make it in LA?

00:11:50.376 --> 00:11:52.111 line:95%,end
- They love her there.
- I don't know.

00:11:52.178 --> 00:11:55.147 line:95%,end
When I visit LA, I am obese.

00:11:55.214 --> 00:11:57.249 line:95%,end
And you said they love Abby there?

00:11:57.316 --> 00:12:00.352 line:95%,end
Believe it or not, there's a lot
of personalities like Abby in LA.

00:12:00.419 --> 00:12:01.620 line:95%,end
Drag queens?

00:12:02.755 --> 00:12:05.791 line:95%,end
So what does that leave
for the studio here?

00:12:05.858 --> 00:12:07.760 line:95%,end
Why would she just abandon this one

00:12:07.827 --> 00:12:09.628 line:95%,end
and just open up something
totally different--

00:12:09.695 --> 00:12:14.400 line:95%,end
Because she wants that to be successful,
and this will be gone.

00:12:15.868 --> 00:12:19.472 line:95%,end
Do you think that Cathy will keep coming
after us at future competitions?

00:12:19.538 --> 00:12:21.841 line:95%,end
Yes.
Cathy will not give up.

00:12:21.907 --> 00:12:25.611 line:95%,end
Cathy will enter herself
in the open solo category

00:12:25.678 --> 00:12:28.547 line:95%,end
and dance her own dance if it
means competing against us.

00:12:28.614 --> 00:12:30.149 line:5%,start
Cathy is like a cockroach.

00:12:30.216 --> 00:12:31.851 line:5%,start
It can survive a nuclear Holocaust,

00:12:31.917 --> 00:12:33.352 line:5%,start
and it's still crawling around.

00:12:33.419 --> 00:12:35.721 line:95%,end
Cathy will still be crawling
into dance competitions.

00:12:35.788 --> 00:12:37.823 line:95%,end
Well, I think Cathy's team is in shambles.

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:39.258 line:95%,end
They are in shambles.

00:12:39.325 --> 00:12:40.926 line:95%,end
Maybe she's like recruiting more.

00:12:40.993 --> 00:12:42.461 line:95%,end
Something's going on.

00:12:42.528 --> 00:12:46.866 line:95%,end
I absolutely know we'll be seeing Cathy
again, because she can't leave us alone.

00:12:46.932 --> 00:12:50.169 line:95%,end
All right, cheers to an Abby free world.

00:12:50.236 --> 00:12:51.337 line:95%,end

I want to tell you a little bit
about the dance.

I got so many ideas going on,

want to talk about

- You do?

- No, I don't.
- No boyfriends?

00:13:21.767 --> 00:13:24.737 line:95%,end
I have one.

00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:26.405 line:95%,end
So a kiss on the cheek?

I don't know.

Hi. Good. We're all sitting here

What's happening?
Are you coming?

00:14:04.844 --> 00:14:07.379 line:95%,end
Yeah, well that's you know going

You know, do you think
she'll be able to learn this?

know that the competition is

Dance USA, and it's in
Youngstown which is literally

I want to leave the calling card,

you know this is the starting place

00:14:44.917 --> 00:14:46.452 line:95%,end
for this premier dance team.

00:14:46.518 --> 00:14:51.123 line:95%,end
OK, I have to have perfection,
I have to have amazing choreography

that I'm on board with.

00:14:52.558 --> 00:14:55.794 line:95%,end
I'm doing a mental head
count-- where is Mari?

00:14:55.861 --> 00:14:58.631 line:95%,end
I am still assessing this team.

00:14:58.697 --> 00:15:01.634 line:95%,end
We've only been together a day or so.

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:06.338 line:95%,end
The fact that Mari is
not here and she's absent

00:15:06.405 --> 00:15:09.608 line:95%,end
really kind of proves to me
what her commitment is to this team.

00:15:10.409 --> 00:15:11.810 line:95%,end
How about if you guys just show me

00:15:11.877 --> 00:15:13.679 line:95%,end
with my counts what you
guys have been working on?

00:15:14.213 --> 00:15:16.215 line:5%,start
Five, six, seven, eight.

00:15:16.282 --> 00:15:21.020 line:5%,start
And one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

00:15:21.086 --> 00:15:25.991 line:95%,end
And one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

00:15:26.058 --> 00:15:30.429 line:95%,end
OK so, so far what I'm seeing
is brilliant on your part.

00:15:30.496 --> 00:15:35.634 line:95%,end
Go and rehearse what you've been
given so far,

00:15:35.701 --> 00:15:37.202 line:95%,end
Anthony and I will chat.

00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:39.204 line:95%,end
Kids get to go out.

00:15:39.338 --> 00:15:43.008 line:95%,end
I like what I saw Zack doing,
I like what I saw Hadley doing,

00:15:43.075 --> 00:15:45.544 line:95%,end
- Campbell is weak.
- Is a mess, she's weak.

00:15:45.611 --> 00:15:46.912 line:95%,end
She's the weak link.

00:15:46.979 --> 00:15:49.014 line:95%,end
Maybe we need to give her
a little bit more time.

00:15:49.081 --> 00:15:53.018 line:95%,end
So Mari isn't here,
Campbell isn't cutting it

00:15:53.085 --> 00:15:56.722 line:95%,end
as far as choreography,
competition days away.

00:15:56.789 --> 00:15:59.224 line:95%,end
This is not how I envisioned it to be.

00:15:59.291 --> 00:16:01.093 line:95%,end
I'm going to have to make
a couple of phone calls.

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:05.731 line:95%,end
[phone ringing]

00:16:05.798 --> 00:16:07.900 line:95%,end
This is Cathy from Candy
Apple Dance Centre.

00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:09.201 line:5%,start
Oh hi.

00:16:09.268 --> 00:16:10.602 line:95%,end
[inaudible] was talking.

00:16:10.669 --> 00:16:13.372 line:95%,end
I don't want to even use your name,
that's why I keep saying her.

00:16:13.439 --> 00:16:15.574 line:95%,end
I got a name I want to call
you too that's not your own,

00:16:15.641 --> 00:16:17.142 line:95%,end
but I'm trying to be respectful.

00:16:17.209 --> 00:16:21.981 line:95%,end
I've met Black Patsy before,
and she's a lovely lady to me.

00:16:22.047 --> 00:16:25.451 line:95%,end
I know that her daughter, Nicaya,
is a good dancer.

00:16:25.517 --> 00:16:29.788 line:95%,end
Well, listen I'm actually down a dancer,

00:16:29.855 --> 00:16:32.758 line:95%,end
and I was wondering if your daughter was

00:16:32.825 --> 00:16:36.095 line:95%,end
interested in coming over to Candy Apples

00:16:36.161 --> 00:16:39.365 line:95%,end
to try and do a competition
this week for me.

00:16:45.337 --> 00:16:47.373 line:5%,start
I want to see what they
can add to my team.

00:16:47.439 --> 00:16:50.709 line:95%,end
I think that not only will
Nicaya step up and show me

00:16:50.776 --> 00:16:53.912 line:95%,end
that she's a strong dancer,
but I also think that Black Patsy

00:16:53.979 --> 00:16:55.147 line:95%,end
is going to come to bat for me.


00:16:58.984 --> 00:17:01.353 line:5%,start
[music playing]

00:17:03.789 --> 00:17:05.491 line:5%,start
ABBY LEE MILLER: Oh, hey.

00:17:05.557 --> 00:17:06.558 line:5%,start
Sunflowers?

00:17:09.895 --> 00:17:12.765 line:5%,start
So I'm in my dressing room
getting into the makeup

00:17:12.831 --> 00:17:14.733 line:95%,end
and hair, it's a big long process,

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:17.870 line:95%,end
and who walks in to surprise me but John.

00:17:17.936 --> 00:17:20.572 line:95%,end
Word on the street,
she's been doing competitions,

00:17:20.639 --> 00:17:21.940 line:95%,end
and you know that.

00:17:22.007 --> 00:17:24.176 line:95%,end
She can do whatever she wants,
just stay the hell away from me.

00:17:24.243 --> 00:17:25.878 line:95%,end
But you still have to strategize.

00:17:25.944 --> 00:17:28.514 line:95%,end
What if you went and had some of the moms

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:32.151 line:95%,end
go watch a competition,
just to kind of check it out

00:17:32.217 --> 00:17:34.119 line:95%,end
just to see,
I mean, that's smart,

00:17:34.186 --> 00:17:35.521 line:95%,end
I mean, any business would do that.

00:17:35.587 --> 00:17:37.022 line:95%,end
You have to remember, you're a business.

00:17:37.089 --> 00:17:40.659 line:95%,end
Well, Joe would be the
only one, because she really

00:17:40.726 --> 00:17:42.461 line:95%,end
despises Cathy.

00:17:42.528 --> 00:17:46.532 line:95%,end
I found out that, you know,
the Wicked Witch of the West,

00:17:46.598 --> 00:17:48.467 line:95%,end
that evil dance teacher
that shouldn't even

00:17:48.534 --> 00:17:50.502 line:95%,end
be allowed to open, yes.

00:17:50.569 --> 00:17:54.373 line:95%,end
She is attending another
competition with her new team.

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:57.843 line:95%,end
And he thinks that some
of my mom's should go spy.

00:17:57.910 --> 00:17:59.978 line:95%,end
So why not find out what she's up to?

00:18:00.045 --> 00:18:02.881 line:95%,end
Well, then give me the phone,
I'll call her.

How are you?

00:18:08.287 --> 00:18:10.222 line:95%,end
I'm good, how are you?
And it's Abby Miller.

00:18:10.289 --> 00:18:11.557 line:95%,end
She's lying down.

but she is lying down.

We were just talking
about her friend, Cathy.

00:18:20.232 --> 00:18:22.701 line:95%,end
Go ahead, you tell her what you were--

00:18:22.768 --> 00:18:24.937 line:95%,end
A little digging, we just
need you to do a little digging.

ANTHONY BURRELL: Go.

00:18:40.385 --> 00:18:41.720 line:5%,start
You've got to go both legs.

00:18:41.787 --> 00:18:43.388 line:5%,start
One, two.

00:18:43.455 --> 00:18:44.890 line:5%,start
You got to put those feet together.

00:18:44.957 --> 00:18:47.226 line:95%,end
Once you turn, put your feet
together, then separate them.

00:18:47.292 --> 00:18:50.996 line:95%,end
Six, seven, see each other,
and then look, and look,

00:18:52.898 --> 00:18:54.666 line:95%,end
Now up.

How are you guys this morning?

00:18:57.169 --> 00:18:58.403 line:95%,end
ANTHONY BURRELL: I'm cool.

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:00.572 line:95%,end
I got Mari caught up a
little bit, because I--

00:19:00.639 --> 00:19:02.741 line:95%,end
Oh, Mari is here?

00:19:02.808 --> 00:19:04.943 line:5%,start
Mari, how are you feeling?

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:06.979 line:95%,end
You're better?
Is she working hard?

00:19:07.045 --> 00:19:08.480 line:95%,end
ANTHONY BURRELL:
Yeah, she's working hard.

00:19:08.547 --> 00:19:12.384 line:95%,end
OK, listen guys.
I have made my decision on solos.

00:19:12.451 --> 00:19:14.586 line:95%,end
Oh, my God.

00:19:14.653 --> 00:19:19.791 line:95%,end
My first solo is going
to be given to Zack.

[applause]

00:19:23.028 --> 00:19:25.898 line:5%,start
Zack has a solo this week
which is phenomenal,

00:19:25.964 --> 00:19:27.666 line:5%,start
I am really excited about it.

00:19:27.733 --> 00:19:31.069 line:95%,end
I have every confidence
that he will not disappoint.

00:19:33.005 --> 00:19:39.545 line:95%,end
My second solo is going to go to Hadley.

00:19:39.611 --> 00:19:41.513 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:19:42.481 --> 00:19:43.615 line:5%,start
I'm ecstatic.

00:19:43.682 --> 00:19:46.118 line:5%,start
Anthony is an incredible choreographer,

00:19:46.185 --> 00:19:48.487 line:5%,start
he's an incredible instructor,

00:19:48.554 --> 00:19:50.355 line:95%,end
he's very passionate about dance.

00:19:50.422 --> 00:19:53.625 line:95%,end
My ultimate goal for this is
to take our own dream team

00:19:53.692 --> 00:19:54.860 line:95%,end
and beat Abby.

00:19:55.661 --> 00:19:57.963 line:95%,end
I feel bad for Nick.

00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:01.133 line:95%,end
I do, he works so hard, this kid.

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:05.003 line:5%,start
I think that Nick has proved
to Cathy all these times

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:06.238 line:95%,end
that we've been here.

00:20:06.305 --> 00:20:08.974 line:95%,end
He's so versatile
with all styles of dance.

00:20:09.041 --> 00:20:12.377 line:95%,end
And the other parents,
they need to pay their dues

00:20:12.444 --> 00:20:15.247 line:95%,end
before they get some solos
and some specialty parts.

00:20:15.314 --> 00:20:19.017 line:95%,end
Nick should be Cathy's leading man.

00:20:20.018 --> 00:20:21.653 line:5%,start
ANTHONY BURRELL: So
Had, you got two days.

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.822 line:5%,start
We got to go hard.

00:20:23.889 --> 00:20:27.492 line:5%,start
So the music I got for you
is called "The Golden Couch."

00:20:27.559 --> 00:20:32.864 line:95%,end
It's about being a woman, being
glamorized, and being really elegant.

00:20:32.931 --> 00:20:34.166 line:95%,end
- OK.
- Cool?

00:20:34.233 --> 00:20:35.667 line:95%,end

00:20:38.103 --> 00:20:39.338 line:5%,start
But go [dance noises].

00:20:39.404 --> 00:20:44.142 line:5%,start
I'm really excited that Cathy gave
me a solo, because now I get to show her

00:20:44.209 --> 00:20:46.044 line:95%,end
all of my skills that I can do.

00:20:46.111 --> 00:20:48.847 line:95%,end
And I want to show her that
I'm going to stay on this team.

00:20:49.648 --> 00:20:52.951 line:95%,end
Boom boom, boom boom, boom boom.

00:20:53.252 --> 00:20:54.253 line:95%,end
Step.

00:20:54.353 --> 00:20:55.587 line:95%,end
This way?

00:20:55.654 --> 00:20:57.723 line:95%,end
You got to give me give me two arms facing
this way before you tip over.

00:20:59.191 --> 00:21:00.559 line:95%,end
Hadley is an amazing dancer.

00:21:00.626 --> 00:21:03.262 line:95%,end
I think that she warrants a solo.

00:21:03.328 --> 00:21:05.831 line:95%,end
She has this effervescent glow about her.


00:21:06.031 --> 00:21:07.266 line:95%,end
She's like a golden girl.

00:21:07.332 --> 00:21:09.101 line:95%,end
- So good.
- CATHY: good. job, Hadley.

00:21:09.167 --> 00:21:11.069 line:95%,end
YVETTE: Hadley can learn
a lot from Anthony,

00:21:11.136 --> 00:21:13.472 line:95%,end
and the best quality that Anthony has

00:21:13.538 --> 00:21:17.709 line:95%,end
is that he has the quality
to pull so much from kids

00:21:17.776 --> 00:21:19.244 line:95%,end
versus Abby Lee Miller--

00:21:19.311 --> 00:21:21.179 line:95%,end
she doesn't care about
anything but winning.

00:21:21.246 --> 00:21:25.417 line:95%,end
And if it's even taking a kid down,
it doesn't matter to her.

00:21:25.484 --> 00:21:29.454 line:95%,end
And I know firsthand about
Abby Lee Miller taking kids down.

00:21:30.489 --> 00:21:31.857 line:95%,end
And sit down.

00:21:32.824 --> 00:21:36.228 line:95%,end
Abby, this performance is not roadkill.

00:21:37.929 --> 00:21:39.197 line:95%,end
ANTHONY BURRELL: Come on, Zack.

00:21:39.264 --> 00:21:42.601 line:5%,start
The title of the solo is
"Puppet," so it's going

00:21:42.668 --> 00:21:43.869 line:5%,start
to be a lot of fun for you.

00:21:43.935 --> 00:21:47.406 line:5%,start
The costume for this dance
is going to be incredible.

00:21:47.472 --> 00:21:50.075 line:95%,end
That costume is going to
transform Zack from a boy

00:21:50.142 --> 00:21:51.643 line:95%,end
to a puppet.

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:54.079 line:95%,end
It's just something to make you
heavy, we just got to find ways

00:21:54.146 --> 00:21:55.280 line:95%,end
to make you heavy, yeah?

00:21:55.347 --> 00:21:57.616 line:95%,end
Zack is definitely in his element

00:21:57.683 --> 00:21:59.051 line:95%,end
when he does contemporary.

00:21:59.117 --> 00:22:01.853 line:95%,end
I just think that with Zack's ability

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.589 line:95%,end
to get a story-line across,
that this could really

00:22:04.656 --> 00:22:06.458 line:95%,end
be a brilliant moment for Zack.

[dance noises]

00:22:09.628 --> 00:22:11.663 line:95%,end
I don't know if we have more at stake.

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:15.467 line:95%,end
CATHY: It's always that
same everlasting goal

00:22:15.534 --> 00:22:16.768 line:95%,end
that we want to beat Abby.

00:22:16.835 --> 00:22:17.936 line:95%,end
ANTHONY BURRELL: Great job, though.

00:22:18.003 --> 00:22:19.071 line:95%,end
Good job.

00:22:19.137 --> 00:22:20.772 line:5%,start
I'll get you that song tonight.

00:22:20.839 --> 00:22:23.141 line:5%,start
And it's going to be like
that every competition.

00:22:23.208 --> 00:22:28.447 line:5%,start
Even when we start to develop
a history base of winning,

00:22:28.513 --> 00:22:30.882 line:95%,end
we're still always going
to have to be on our game.

00:22:31.183 --> 00:22:35.053 line:95%,end
Two, three, four, and five, six--

She's awful.

00:22:51.603 --> 00:22:55.440 line:95%,end
I didn't think that Cathy
would have selected Black Patsy

00:22:55.507 --> 00:22:57.442 line:95%,end
and Nicaya to be part of her team.

00:22:57.509 --> 00:23:00.879 line:95%,end
Black Patsy has a reputation
of being very vocal.

00:23:00.946 --> 00:23:02.047 line:95%,end
She's a fighter.

[shouting]

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:06.718 line:95%,end
Shut your big month.

00:23:06.785 --> 00:23:08.153 line:95%,end
You shut up, bitch, I'm grown!

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:09.321 line:95%,end
Shut up!

00:23:09.388 --> 00:23:11.056 line:95%,end
Who you talking to?

00:23:11.123 --> 00:23:13.859 line:95%,end
CATHY: You need to get her in,
we're working on choreography.

00:23:13.925 --> 00:23:15.494 line:95%,end
Get back here and understudy her.

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:16.828 line:95%,end
Get back here and understudy here.

00:23:16.895 --> 00:23:18.730 line:95%,end
Please, learn everything that she's doing.

00:23:18.797 --> 00:23:20.799 line:95%,end
She's going to learn
the choreography now too?

00:23:20.866 --> 00:23:22.801 line:95%,end
So we're going to have
to go back, teach her.

00:23:24.336 --> 00:23:26.204 line:95%,end
Oh, hello, welcome.

00:23:26.271 --> 00:23:27.639 line:95%,end
Hi.

00:23:27.706 --> 00:23:29.908 line:95%,end
So what brings you over here to Canton?

00:23:29.975 --> 00:23:31.109 line:95%,end
We were called.

Now that Mari's feeling better,

00:23:36.948 --> 00:23:40.152 line:5%,start
why do we have to bring in
this other little dancer?

00:23:40.218 --> 00:23:42.220 line:5%,start
I don't know what to think of that.

00:23:47.058 --> 00:23:49.594 line:95%,end

CATHY: All right, guys,
in a straight line, please.

00:23:53.532 --> 00:23:54.533 line:5%,start
This is serious.

00:23:54.599 --> 00:23:57.235 line:95%,end
We are leaving tomorrow
to go to competition.

00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:01.173 line:95%,end
You guys have to have some passion.

00:24:02.507 --> 00:24:04.276 line:95%,end
I'm expecting people to be better.

00:24:04.342 --> 00:24:09.514 line:95%,end
Jalen and Campbell,

00:24:09.581 --> 00:24:11.383 line:95%,end
you know
that this is not your element,

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:14.853 line:95%,end
and I need to cut somebody
from the group dance right now.

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.795 line:95%,end
Campbell, I need to have you sit down,

00:24:23.862 --> 00:24:26.064 line:95%,end
you're cut from the group dance.

00:24:26.131 --> 00:24:27.265 line:95%,end
Wow.

00:24:27.332 --> 00:24:29.734 line:95%,end
CATHY: I want you to sit,
and I want you to learn.

00:24:29.801 --> 00:24:31.803 line:95%,end
You're off on everything.

00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:36.641 line:95%,end
I think that if you sit and
you watch and you learn,

00:24:36.708 --> 00:24:38.243 line:95%,end
that there might be hope.

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:40.579 line:95%,end
I've made a decision
that I'm taking Campbell

00:24:40.645 --> 00:24:41.847 line:95%,end
out of the group dance.

00:24:41.913 --> 00:24:43.281 line:95%,end
I'm going to make her an understudy.

00:24:43.348 --> 00:24:46.518 line:95%,end
She's just not right for
the contemporary team.

00:24:47.652 --> 00:24:49.921 line:95%,end
[crying]

00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:53.959 line:95%,end
ALLI: I'm mortified that
Campbell's on this group dance.

00:24:54.025 --> 00:24:56.127 line:5%,start
She's an understudy, she's an understudy.

00:24:56.194 --> 00:24:57.863 line:95%,end
And she's kind of been
cast off to the side.

00:24:57.929 --> 00:24:59.631 line:95%,end
I don't like that,
I will not make it up to fail.

00:24:59.698 --> 00:25:02.634 line:95%,end
(SOBBING) Mom, it's over,
I don't want to--

00:25:02.701 --> 00:25:04.536 line:95%,end
It's only over if you believe that.

00:25:05.971 --> 00:25:08.206 line:95%,end
Can you please wipe the tears?

00:25:31.396 --> 00:25:33.398 line:95%,end
OK.

00:25:33.465 --> 00:25:37.168 line:95%,end
JILL: Abby's in LA, and she had asked me
to find out what Cathy's up to.

00:25:37.235 --> 00:25:38.403 line:95%,end
Who's on her team?

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:40.405 line:5%,start
Where's she going?

00:25:40.472 --> 00:25:42.107 line:5%,start
What are the kids doing?

00:25:42.173 --> 00:25:45.443 line:95%,end
We've never done dance USA before.

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:48.613 line:95%,end
So that's what we're here for is to
scout out some new competitions.

[interposing voices]

00:25:50.382 --> 00:25:53.018 line:95%,end
10-12, CAD Dancer, Candy Apples Dance.

[interposing voices]

00:25:56.588 --> 00:25:59.324 line:95%,end
So we'll have to go do some
sneaking around to investigate.

00:25:59.391 --> 00:26:00.692 line:95%,end
I have something in my eye.

00:26:00.759 --> 00:26:02.561 line:95%,end
- It's like glue.
- ZACK: I'm changed.

00:26:05.997 --> 00:26:07.365 line:95%,end
CATHY: OK.

00:26:07.432 --> 00:26:08.833 line:95%,end
The shorts are hideous.

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:11.303 line:95%,end
You don't want to dance like that,
that's going to make you feel like a goof.

00:26:11.369 --> 00:26:12.470 line:95%,end
ZACK: They ride up like--

00:26:12.537 --> 00:26:13.572 line:95%,end
Yeah.

00:26:13.638 --> 00:26:14.873 line:95%,end
I'm calling the shots on this one,

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:16.575 line:95%,end
he's like going out in those Speedos.

00:26:17.242 --> 00:26:18.610 line:95%,end
Thank you.

00:26:18.677 --> 00:26:21.846 line:95%,end
I don't put my dancers out on stage
if they're uncomfortable,

00:26:21.913 --> 00:26:23.615 line:95%,end
and it's going to hinder their dance.

00:26:23.682 --> 00:26:25.984 line:95%,end
Zack is not going out in those Speedos.

00:26:26.051 --> 00:26:30.221 line:95%,end
I'm not going to put somebody out there
and have them look like a fool.

00:26:30.288 --> 00:26:31.623 line:95%,end
Your choreography is in jeopardy.

00:26:34.192 --> 00:26:35.226 line:95%,end
CATHY: No.
- Yes.

00:26:35.293 --> 00:26:40.198 line:5%,start
Cathy and Gina are making
these crazy decisions.

00:26:40.265 --> 00:26:42.467 line:95%,end
You know, if Zack doesn't
wear those shorts,

00:26:42.534 --> 00:26:43.802 line:95%,end
I don't think he's going to do as well.

00:26:43.868 --> 00:26:47.072 line:95%,end
He's just showing his inner divaness.

00:26:47.138 --> 00:26:48.673 line:95%,end
All right, now you're crying.

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:50.675 line:95%,end
I love your dance.

00:26:50.742 --> 00:26:53.011 line:95%,end
You're supposed to be emulating--

00:26:53.078 --> 00:26:54.879 line:95%,end
ZACK: I was feeling confident until now.

00:26:54.946 --> 00:26:59.117 line:95%,end
GINA: It's just heartbreaking to me,
because I know that he's feeling

00:26:59.184 --> 00:27:00.518 line:95%,end
so much pressure.

00:27:00.585 --> 00:27:02.754 line:5%,start
And I'm not going to let him
go out there uncomfortable.

the last competition!

No, we walked away, we walked away.

00:27:50.902 --> 00:27:52.537 line:95%,end
No, they escorted you out.

00:27:52.604 --> 00:27:55.173 line:95%,end
They told us the police
are here just in case

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.307 line:5%,start
you have a little issue.

We walk into the dressing room,

00:27:57.842 --> 00:28:01.980 line:5%,start
and there's a Black Patsy,
and she has this new look.

00:28:02.047 --> 00:28:04.349 line:95%,end
And she looks exactly like Holly--

00:28:04.416 --> 00:28:08.053 line:95%,end
has Holly's hairdo,
is dressed like Holly.

00:28:08.119 --> 00:28:10.989 line:95%,end
I'm thinking to myself,
are you trying to be Holly?

00:28:11.056 --> 00:28:14.225 line:95%,end
Because you'll never be
like Holly, Black Patsy.

00:28:14.292 --> 00:28:17.996 line:95%,end
No matter how hard you try, you'll just
never be like Darker Holly.

Ew, I smell something.

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:35.080 line:95%,end
So did you bring some competition numbers?

00:28:35.146 --> 00:28:36.748 line:95%,end
We're just here scouting out.

00:28:36.815 --> 00:28:38.183 line:95%,end
CATHY: So what are you scouting for?

00:28:38.249 --> 00:28:41.686 line:95%,end
We never did this competition, so we were
just coming to see what it's like.

00:28:41.753 --> 00:28:42.954 line:95%,end
Oh, right.

00:28:43.021 --> 00:28:45.824 line:95%,end
So this is their assignment that they've

00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:48.493 line:95%,end
been given to come scout
this competition out

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.595 line:95%,end
which is nothing but a facade.

00:28:50.662 --> 00:28:52.664 line:95%,end
I think that that just proves
that Abby is threatened

00:28:52.731 --> 00:28:54.065 line:95%,end

00:31:45.436 --> 00:31:47.505 line:95%,end
Are you still out the competition?

00:31:47.572 --> 00:31:52.343 line:95%,end
I want to know every little detail, what
is the Wicked Witch of the West up to?

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:54.579 line:95%,end
Jill, come on, spill the beans.

00:31:54.646 --> 00:31:56.714 line:95%,end
JILL (ON PHONE): You can't believe, Abby,

00:31:56.781 --> 00:31:59.517 line:95%,end
who she had with her.

00:31:59.584 --> 00:32:01.686 line:95%,end
She has Hadley.

00:32:01.753 --> 00:32:04.022 line:95%,end
Hadley?
You mean roadkill?

00:32:04.088 --> 00:32:05.423 line:95%,end
JILL (ON PHONE): And her mom.

00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:07.225 line:95%,end
Well, that mother is crazy.

00:32:07.292 --> 00:32:12.030 line:95%,end
JILL (ON PHONE): And
she had Nicaya and Kaya.

00:32:12.096 --> 00:32:14.399 line:95%,end
You owe me big time for coming here.

00:32:14.465 --> 00:32:16.434 line:95%,end
Cathy's a pain in my ass.

00:32:16.501 --> 00:32:19.470 line:95%,end
Jill go back to the competition
and watch, text me.

00:32:19.537 --> 00:32:21.005 line:95%,end
Give me a buzz if anything comes up.

00:32:21.072 --> 00:32:23.608 line:95%,end
JILL (ON PHONE): OK, all right.
Sound good. Be safe. See you soon.

00:32:23.675 --> 00:32:25.810 line:95%,end
Take care, you too, bye bye.

00:32:25.877 --> 00:32:28.680 line:95%,end
Even though I'm not at
my studio physically,

00:32:28.746 --> 00:32:31.382 line:95%,end
I'm there in spirit, and my curriculum

00:32:31.449 --> 00:32:33.384 line:95%,end
is being taught the way
I would present it.

00:32:33.451 --> 00:32:36.554 line:95%,end
Hopefully the kids are
working diligently,

00:32:36.621 --> 00:32:38.723 line:95%,end
fine tuning their technique.

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:41.459 line:95%,end
No-- you're together,

00:32:41.526 --> 00:32:45.897 line:95%,end
shoot, it circles and goes up,

00:32:45.964 --> 00:32:47.565 line:95%,end
together, sit.

00:32:47.632 --> 00:32:49.000 line:95%,end
Really put it on your head.

00:32:49.067 --> 00:32:51.336 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: I'm confident
Gianna's in rehearsal,

00:32:51.402 --> 00:32:52.637 line:5%,start
she can handle it.

00:32:58.443 --> 00:33:02.180 line:95%,end
I'm proud. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

00:33:04.849 --> 00:33:07.018 line:95%,end
Hadley's growing, and she's shining.

00:33:07.085 --> 00:33:08.586 line:95%,end
She wants please you.

00:33:08.653 --> 00:33:09.721 line:95%,end
It's not about me.

00:33:09.787 --> 00:33:10.989 line:95%,end
She doesn't want you to yell at her.

00:33:11.055 --> 00:33:12.790 line:95%,end
Like she's trying to be
a perfectionist for you.

00:33:12.857 --> 00:33:14.592 line:95%,end
You're the reason why we were here.

00:33:14.659 --> 00:33:16.995 line:95%,end
Did you hear her?
Did you hear her?

00:33:17.061 --> 00:33:18.429 line:5%,start
I think it's a little
disheartening Yvette makes

00:33:18.496 --> 00:33:20.098 line:5%,start
it clear that she's here for Anthony.

00:33:20.164 --> 00:33:21.933 line:95%,end
I think if Anthony walked
out the door tomorrow,

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.501 line:95%,end
Yvette would be trailing behind.

00:33:23.568 --> 00:33:26.437 line:95%,end
Why do you keep saying
you're here for Anthony?

00:33:26.504 --> 00:33:28.373 line:95%,end
If you're supposed to be
here for Cathy, why won't you--

00:33:28.439 --> 00:33:29.507 line:95%,end
why do you keep saying that?

00:33:29.574 --> 00:33:31.442 line:95%,end
We're team [inaudible]---- look at this.

00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:34.712 line:95%,end
I've got my Apple core on,
I'm Apple today.

00:33:34.779 --> 00:33:36.748 line:95%,end
She's only here for
you and not for the team.

00:33:36.814 --> 00:33:38.383 line:95%,end
Smarten up right now, OK.

00:33:38.449 --> 00:33:40.585 line:95%,end
The choreographer is
going to pick the dancers.

00:33:40.651 --> 00:33:42.387 line:95%,end
Well, that's why you're all up
his ass all day.

00:33:42.453 --> 00:33:44.022 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:33:44.088 --> 00:33:46.124 line:95%,end
You're smiling, but behind our back

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:47.692 line:95%,end
you're probably holding a knife.

00:33:47.759 --> 00:33:49.827 line:95%,end
- Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- She is, yes, she is.

00:33:49.894 --> 00:33:51.963 line:95%,end
No.
I thought I was starting to like you.

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:54.232 line:95%,end
You feel like when Hadley's
dancing, you're dancing.

00:33:54.298 --> 00:33:55.600 line:95%,end
You are living though your daughter.

00:33:55.666 --> 00:33:57.235 line:95%,end
- I'm not living through her.
- Yes, you are.

00:33:57.301 --> 00:33:58.503 line:95%,end
No, wrong.

00:33:58.569 --> 00:34:00.038 line:95%,end
No, the [inaudible] are coming.

00:34:00.104 --> 00:34:02.540 line:95%,end
- Quiet!
- Don't yell at me again!

00:34:05.209 --> 00:34:07.145 line:95%,end
What is all this bickering going on?

00:34:07.211 --> 00:34:09.447 line:95%,end
I hear nothing but chit chat
out in the hall.

00:34:09.514 --> 00:34:12.750 line:95%,end
I am wearing--
I'm a Candy Apple, look at this.

00:34:12.817 --> 00:34:14.152 line:95%,end
Whoa.

00:34:14.819 --> 00:34:16.687 line:95%,end
She just said she was here for Anthony.

00:34:16.754 --> 00:34:19.590 line:95%,end
She said it three times today,
she's not her for you.

00:34:19.657 --> 00:34:21.092 line:95%,end
Whoa.

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:23.895 line:95%,end
Sit down and be quiet, because
nobody is going to let you win.

00:34:23.961 --> 00:34:25.196 line:95%,end
I'm out.

00:34:25.263 --> 00:34:27.598 line:95%,end
The only winning that we
need to be talking about

00:34:27.665 --> 00:34:30.935 line:95%,end
is either one of our soloists
or one of our groups.

00:34:31.569 --> 00:34:32.637 line:95%,end
This is Happyland.

00:34:32.703 --> 00:34:36.207 line:95%,end
These parents have got to know
that they're coming together

00:34:36.274 --> 00:34:39.010 line:5%,start
in support of Candy Apples,
and they better stop.


00:34:42.814 --> 00:34:43.815 line:5%,start
ANTHONY BURRELL: Come here, guys.

It's been a week of ups and downs, guys.

00:34:46.984 --> 00:34:51.255 line:95%,end
You guys have the talent, the passion,
and the courage to do this.

00:34:51.322 --> 00:34:53.391 line:95%,end
Go out there, and do what you love,
that's all you have to do.

00:34:53.458 --> 00:34:55.793 line:95%,end
Whoever's going to get cut
from the Candy Apples team

00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:57.495 line:95%,end
is going to be heartbroken.

00:34:57.562 --> 00:35:00.965 line:95%,end
And honestly, I don't know how
I'm going to make this decision.

00:35:02.433 --> 00:35:05.403 line:95%,end
I need you to be ready in that
wing if anything happens, OK?

like they're a threat to us.

ANTHONY BURRELL: Zack did an
amazing job, but I have to say,

00:37:29.046 --> 00:37:32.350 line:5%,start
I think he would place higher if he wore
the costume that I envisioned for him.

because I want to find out just
who's been in class and who hasn't.

Because some of their moms
think that when Abby's away,

the mouse can play.

00:39:24.862 --> 00:39:27.031 line:95%,end

Yeah, believe it or not, we
might end up in Beverly Hills.

So I sent Jill and some
of the moms

00:39:51.722 --> 00:39:56.193 line:95%,end
to kind of spy on Cathy and her kids.

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:58.829 line:95%,end
So I'm not sure what our
first competition back is,

00:39:58.896 --> 00:40:01.098 line:95%,end
but if we end up competing against them,

00:40:01.165 --> 00:40:03.234 line:95%,end
those girls better be in tip top shape.

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:04.869 line:95%,end
GIANNA (ON PHONE): They will be.

00:40:04.935 --> 00:40:06.504 line:95%,end
All right, listen,
I got to go catch some rays.

00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:07.838 line:95%,end
Gotta run.

00:40:07.905 --> 00:40:09.006 line:95%,end
GIANNA (ON PHONE): [inaudible]

00:40:09.073 --> 00:40:11.142 line:95%,end
All right, bye, I'll see you soon.

00:40:11.208 --> 00:40:13.010 line:5%,start
[music playing]

00:40:15.112 --> 00:40:17.014 line:95%,end
Ooh, [inaudible].

00:40:17.081 --> 00:40:18.315 line:95%,end
Why are they following us?

00:40:18.382 --> 00:40:19.984 line:95%,end
[squealing]

00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:21.485 line:95%,end
Vivi, you didn't dance today?

00:40:21.552 --> 00:40:23.020 line:95%,end
No, how come?

00:40:23.087 --> 00:40:24.255 line:95%,end
OK.

00:40:24.321 --> 00:40:26.023 line:95%,end
Why do you worry about what Vivi is doing?

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:27.158 line:95%,end
I'm asking Vivi a question.

00:40:27.224 --> 00:40:28.592 line:95%,end
CATHY: You don't need to ask
her why she's not dancing.

00:40:28.659 --> 00:40:29.693 line:5%,start
Why?

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:31.328 line:5%,start
I think that Jill, Kelly, and Holly

00:40:31.395 --> 00:40:32.696 line:5%,start
you're just a bunch of damn stalkers.

00:40:32.763 --> 00:40:34.432 line:95%,end
Why would you be at a competition

00:40:34.498 --> 00:40:35.733 line:95%,end
if your kids are not performing?

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:38.702 line:95%,end
I noticed you had four girls,
but only three danced.

00:40:38.769 --> 00:40:40.905 line:95%,end
Well, there were four
girls sitting on stage.

00:40:40.971 --> 00:40:42.807 line:95%,end
Would you let her talk
instead of running your mouth?

00:40:42.873 --> 00:40:44.909 line:95%,end
- Where are your kids?
- They're on vacation.

00:40:44.975 --> 00:40:47.645 line:95%,end
Well, you know what?
Put your mouth on vacation.

00:40:47.711 --> 00:40:48.946 line:95%,end
[dramatic music]

00:40:49.013 --> 00:40:50.314 line:95%,end
[laughter]

00:40:50.381 --> 00:40:52.082 line:95%,end
- Shut up.
- Who said shut up?

00:40:52.149 --> 00:40:53.284 line:95%,end
How old are you?

00:40:53.350 --> 00:40:56.053 line:95%,end
You said my daughter sucked, remember?

00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:58.989 line:95%,end
That little girl cannot dance,
your daughter cannot dance.

00:40:59.056 --> 00:41:00.391 line:95%,end
Well, you know what's funny?

00:41:00.458 --> 00:41:02.726 line:95%,end
We said the same thing
about your little girl.

00:41:02.793 --> 00:41:05.563 line:95%,end

Jalen will beat Mari hands down.

You can't find your legs.

ANNOUNCER 5: "Dance Moms," Maddie
of the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:41:27.051 --> 00:41:29.787 line:5%,start
You have called me a joke,

Cathy.

00:41:30.955 --> 00:41:32.223 line:5%,start
CATHY: Oh, my gosh, are you crying?

00:41:32.289 --> 00:41:34.458 line:5%,start
Ideally, I want a team of five.

00:41:34.525 --> 00:41:36.327 line:5%,start
You can do the math.
