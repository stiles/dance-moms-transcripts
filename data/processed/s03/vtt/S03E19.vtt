ABBY LEE: Previously on "Dance Moms."

00:00:02.936 --> 00:00:03.937 line:5%,start
Here we are!

00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:05.005 line:5%,start
New York City.

00:00:06.106 --> 00:00:09.209 line:5%,start
We need to work on
"The Last Text" for The View.

00:00:09.275 --> 00:00:11.044 line:5%,start
Asia, walk in and take over.

00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:12.946 line:5%,start
They're going to forget about you.

00:00:13.646 --> 00:00:14.514 line:5%,start
What's that?

00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:15.415 line:5%,start
CHRISTI: What's this?

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:16.616 line:5%,start
What's she doing?

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.252 line:5%,start
It's a thank you card
for letting me on the team.

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:21.454 line:5%,start
Oh!

00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:23.823 line:5%,start
We are holding an open audition.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:24.858 line:5%,start
We found a girl.

00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:27.027 line:5%,start
Hello.

00:00:27.093 --> 00:00:28.561 line:5%,start
Let me hear it for Candy Apples.

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:29.462 line:5%,start
Are we going to win?

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:30.363 line:5%,start
ALL: Yeah!

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:33.133 line:5%,start
ABBY LEE: Coming up on "Dance Moms."

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:34.901 line:5%,start
Do not embarrass me with Cathy.

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:36.369 line:5%,start
Do not embarrass me in New York.

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:37.504 line:5%,start
- Christi--
- Yes, I'm speaking.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.672 line:5%,start
Look at me when you talk.
Look at me when you talk.

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:41.474 line:5%,start
Excuse me?
I'm looking you in the eye, bitch.

00:00:42.475 --> 00:00:43.576 line:5%,start
ANTHONY: Step out of my face.

00:00:43.643 --> 00:00:45.378 line:5%,start
You want to see me in your face?

00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:48.448 line:5%,start
Tell her to ignore me because
I don't say nothing to her.

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:50.016 line:5%,start
I'll kick you right in the [bleep]..

00:00:50.483 --> 00:00:51.584 line:5%,start
KELLY: Paige?

00:00:52.018 --> 00:00:54.554 line:5%,start
I didn't want my
daughter being humiliated.

00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:56.823 line:5%,start
And instead of it going away,

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.826 line:5%,start
she did it in front of an entire
[bleep] live audience.

00:01:03.196 --> 00:01:06.232 line:95%,end
THEME SONG: Get up, get on the floor.

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:11.838 line:95%,end
My world is with my girls,
Livin' on the dance floor.

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:20.313 line:95%,end
Step back.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.214 line:95%,end
[inaudible] should back up.

00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:22.449 line:95%,end
Then the turns.

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:23.750 line:95%,end
Who backed up?

00:01:23.817 --> 00:01:25.685 line:5%,start
This week, we're here in New York City

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:28.121 line:5%,start
and "The View" was amazing,

00:01:28.188 --> 00:01:30.056 line:95%,end
but now I got to get back to business.

00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:33.093 line:95%,end
We are attending the Masters of Dance,

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.228 line:95%,end
and I know that Cathy's going to be there,

00:01:35.295 --> 00:01:37.497 line:95%,end
and she's gunning for our heads.

00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:43.203 line:95%,end
I have solos going,
plus a very controversial group number.

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:45.872 line:95%,end
Everybody is in the group routine.

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.641 line:95%,end
Asia, you will be performing a solo.

00:01:48.708 --> 00:01:49.609 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:01:49.676 --> 00:01:51.845 line:95%,end
I have another solo going to Chloe.

00:01:52.045 --> 00:01:53.413 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:01:54.047 --> 00:01:56.249 line:95%,end
Maddie, you will also be doing a solo.

00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:57.617 line:95%,end
All right, listen up, girls.

00:01:57.684 --> 00:01:58.852 line:95%,end
This is the way it's gonna go.

00:01:58.918 --> 00:02:02.322 line:95%,end
"The View" today, although spectacular,

00:02:02.388 --> 00:02:04.457 line:95%,end
took up a lot of our good time.

00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:07.160 line:95%,end
So I'm gonna start with the solos.

00:02:07.427 --> 00:02:12.065 line:95%,end
I need everybody to have their head on
straight and ready for this competition.

00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:17.437 line:95%,end
Put a chaine in there.

00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:21.174 line:95%,end
CHLOE: This week,
I have a solo called "My Obsession,"

00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:26.212 line:5%,start
and Miss Abby said it's kind of
contemporary, kind of jazz a little bit.

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:29.349 line:5%,start
And she said the story is am I
obsessed with winning, 

00:02:29.415 --> 00:02:32.418 line:95%,end
am I obsessed with dancing,
am I obsessed--

00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:33.820 line:95%,end
Like, what am I obsessed with?

00:02:33.887 --> 00:02:35.088 line:95%,end
And what is your obsession?

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:39.859 line:95%,end
With dancing and trying my
hardest and never giving up.

00:02:41.561 --> 00:02:44.030 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: So, KRISTIE, how are
you feeling after "The View?"

00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:46.699 line:95%,end
The same.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.134 line:95%,end
[laughs]

00:02:48.368 --> 00:02:49.269 line:95%,end
Who's gonna be in the dance?

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.104 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: You are gonna do the number.

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:55.341 line:95%,end
- I don't know. I just think, you--
- You know what?

00:02:55.408 --> 00:02:57.777 line:95%,end
You're the first to say
I go from 0 to 60.

00:02:57.844 --> 00:02:58.945 line:95%,end
And you're like, "Oh, well, whatever."

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:00.313 line:95%,end
KRISTIE: You know why?
You know why?

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.548 line:95%,end
I expected more
of a fiery reaction out of you.

00:03:01.614 --> 00:03:05.485 line:95%,end
You know, I probably would have been more
fiery if I didn't read it before it came.

00:03:06.352 --> 00:03:07.587 line:95%,end
All right, that's honest.

00:03:07.654 --> 00:03:09.956 line:95%,end
JILL: I think everybody kind of read
it before you came.

00:03:10.056 --> 00:03:10.890 line:95%,end
Oh, you did?

00:03:10.957 --> 00:03:14.460 line:95%,end
The way it played out,
it's like, I already knew, and so--

00:03:14.527 --> 00:03:16.029 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: No,
but don't you feel like a pawn?

00:03:16.095 --> 00:03:17.630 line:95%,end
Like, that would make me mad.
- Well, I-- That's what I said.

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:19.098 line:95%,end
I said I'm over the charade.

00:03:19.165 --> 00:03:22.368 line:95%,end
See, if I had a kid
that couldn't understand

00:03:22.435 --> 00:03:25.205 line:95%,end
or wasn't mature enough to just whatever.

00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:26.539 line:95%,end
It's like an audition.

00:03:26.606 --> 00:03:29.809 line:95%,end
She's been in enough times,
in auditions where

00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:32.679 line:95%,end
that's why it doesn't affect her,
and she's not as sensitive to it.

00:03:32.745 --> 00:03:35.648 line:95%,end
These moms today, you know,
treated Asia and I as like,

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:38.418 line:5%,start
an outsider,
and they didn't want Asia to dance.

00:03:38.484 --> 00:03:39.352 line:5%,start
And you know what?

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:40.520 line:95%,end
I'm not intimidated.

00:03:40.587 --> 00:03:41.754 line:95%,end
We're here to stay,

00:03:41.821 --> 00:03:44.691 line:95%,end
and I've dealt with more difficult
situations than Asia

00:03:44.757 --> 00:03:46.059 line:95%,end
not being on that "View" stage.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.931 line:95%,end
CATHY: OK, guys.

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.907 line:95%,end
So the group dance is going
to be like the Day of the Dead

00:04:00.974 --> 00:04:04.844 line:95%,end
and it's a celebration,
even though death--

00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:07.914 line:95%,end
which is not so much a celebration--
is going on.

00:04:07.981 --> 00:04:09.549 line:95%,end
This drives me insane.

00:04:09.816 --> 00:04:10.750 line:95%,end
What is-- is this--?

00:04:10.817 --> 00:04:11.951 line:95%,end
Do you want it to be a fist?

00:04:12.018 --> 00:04:14.520 line:95%,end
- ANTHONY: A fist.
- This is not a fist, boys.

00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:17.423 line:95%,end
This, to me, is weak, weak.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.826 line:95%,end
Today is about nitpicking.

00:04:19.892 --> 00:04:22.562 line:95%,end
Anthony is gonna get--
he's gonna get fired up today,

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:26.032 line:95%,end
because this number has so much potential.

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:27.634 line:95%,end
It's the love that's
making us feel this way.

00:04:27.734 --> 00:04:29.802 line:5%,start
This is all about making you amazing!

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:32.472 line:95%,end
ANTHONY: Foom, here, you chassÃ©.
Foom.

00:04:32.572 --> 00:04:34.207 line:95%,end
- No, It's too small.
- CATHY: Big chassÃ©.

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:35.875 line:95%,end
- You're like--
- CATHY: Big chassÃ©.

00:04:36.142 --> 00:04:38.144 line:95%,end
You have to from here.
Look, let's go back down.

00:04:38.544 --> 00:04:40.546 line:95%,end
ChassÃ©. And then, look.


00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:43.283 line:95%,end
This all-- Look at my--

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:45.551 line:95%,end
You have to watch
and pay attention to detail.

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:48.254 line:95%,end
You stop and do everything way too fast.

00:04:48.888 --> 00:04:52.358 line:95%,end
CATHY: Victoria seems like she's
a pretty well-rounded dancer.

00:04:52.425 --> 00:04:54.827 line:95%,end
She takes corrections very well.

00:04:54.894 --> 00:05:01.167 line:95%,end
She is not shirking or shunning
to Anthony's sometimes brutal coaching.

00:05:01.234 --> 00:05:03.970 line:95%,end
She's absolutely beautiful,
and she is completely

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.973 line:95%,end
portraying the role that we want
her to for this group number.

00:05:14.213 --> 00:05:15.581 line:5%,start
ABBY LEE: All right, listen to me.

00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:17.317 line:5%,start
What I'm telling you about this number,

00:05:17.383 --> 00:05:20.053 line:5%,start
it needs to make people feel something.

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:23.056 line:95%,end
And if you're not feeling it,
they're not gonna feel it.

00:05:23.122 --> 00:05:27.560 line:95%,end
If we tell a story,
if those judges are in tears, Maddie,

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:29.362 line:95%,end
we need to make them feel something.

00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:34.467 line:95%,end
And you don't know in who's
life out there that's happened.

00:05:34.534 --> 00:05:37.370 line:95%,end
The group number this week
is called "Runaways."

00:05:37.437 --> 00:05:40.606 line:95%,end
Lots of privileged children
run away from home.

00:05:40.673 --> 00:05:42.575 line:95%,end
It's a problem in society today.

00:05:42.642 --> 00:05:45.978 line:5%,start
I feel this is getting
the judges to feel something.

00:05:46.045 --> 00:05:48.848 line:95%,end
Getting our audience
to be moved in some way.

00:05:48.915 --> 00:05:51.651 line:95%,end
If I can do it in an artistic way,
in a respectful way,

00:05:51.718 --> 00:05:54.654 line:95%,end
but I can make the judges see
something and feel something

00:05:54.721 --> 00:05:57.757 line:95%,end
and learn something,
why not take the opportunity?

00:05:57.824 --> 00:05:58.991 line:95%,end
Here.

00:06:00.793 --> 00:06:04.030 line:95%,end
You're hand,
and you look to them for help.

00:06:04.097 --> 00:06:05.231 line:95%,end
Look to her for help.

00:06:05.298 --> 00:06:07.066 line:95%,end
Uh-uh, turn your back on her.

00:06:07.133 --> 00:06:08.835 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Does anybody here--

00:06:08.901 --> 00:06:11.904 line:95%,end
I know the answer used to be
do we think Cathy's a threat,

00:06:11.971 --> 00:06:13.072 line:95%,end
and it was always no.

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:15.141 line:95%,end
But now that she has these boys,
and they beat us,

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:16.976 line:95%,end
- do you think she's a threat?
- JILL: I do.

00:06:17.043 --> 00:06:18.144 line:95%,end
I don't think Cathy's a threat.

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:19.312 line:95%,end
I think the boys are a threat.

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:22.982 line:95%,end
And it has been shown with a
good choreographer, not Cathy,

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:23.883 line:95%,end
to beat our kids.

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:26.352 line:95%,end
So, yes, her boys--
her team is a threat.

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:27.453 line:95%,end
She is no threat.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.388 line:95%,end
It's temporary.

00:06:28.454 --> 00:06:31.657 line:95%,end
I think the group that she
had that danced and got the 300,

00:06:31.724 --> 00:06:34.193 line:95%,end
I think that group is amazing
and it's threatening.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.094 line:95%,end
Right.

00:06:35.161 --> 00:06:37.530 line:95%,end
But that number would
not have been the same

00:06:37.597 --> 00:06:41.134 line:95%,end
without Geno and with Jalen coming in
and spinning on his head.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.302 line:95%,end
Will spin for food, or, dance or whatever.

00:06:43.636 --> 00:06:45.605 line:95%,end
Spinning on the head,
I don't see him fitting in.

00:06:45.671 --> 00:06:49.776 line:95%,end
Can he be put into a contemporary routine
and it be just as good?

00:06:49.842 --> 00:06:50.777 line:95%,end
No, I don't think so.

00:06:50.843 --> 00:06:51.677 line:95%,end
Mm-mm.

00:06:52.545 --> 00:06:54.680 line:95%,end
You're looking at your hands,
like, I did this.

00:06:54.747 --> 00:06:59.652 line:95%,end
Like, wipe your and take your hands
and be, like.

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:02.288 line:95%,end
And then you are, like, take your hands

00:07:02.355 --> 00:07:04.757 line:95%,end
and push them away from me,
like, "get away."

00:07:05.558 --> 00:07:06.392 line:95%,end
Go.

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:07.994 line:95%,end
Whack! Down.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:13.132 line:95%,end
Start to roll in pain, agony,
and look at her like, help me.

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:15.234 line:95%,end
And you push her hands back.

00:07:15.301 --> 00:07:19.972 line:95%,end
No, no, no no, no.

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:22.208 line:95%,end
Yeah.

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:23.209 line:95%,end
JILL: She's the bad girl.

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:24.377 line:95%,end
Hey, it's a role.

00:07:24.877 --> 00:07:25.711 line:95%,end
I don't care.

00:07:26.846 --> 00:07:28.214 line:95%,end
I don't care, it's a role.

00:07:28.748 --> 00:07:30.283 line:95%,end
You got to act, you got to act.

00:07:30.349 --> 00:07:31.484 line:95%,end
Oh, I don't know.

00:07:31.551 --> 00:07:33.586 line:95%,end
It's a little bit sensitive,
wouldn't you say?

00:07:33.653 --> 00:07:35.955 line:95%,end
No, but I-- you know what,
I don't think that way.

00:07:36.022 --> 00:07:38.458 line:95%,end
If she walks or Abby kicks her out,
then that's on her.

00:07:38.524 --> 00:07:40.159 line:95%,end
My kid has a voice.

00:07:40.226 --> 00:07:42.195 line:95%,end
She can raise her--
she can speak for herself.

00:07:42.395 --> 00:07:43.663 line:95%,end
But she's seven.

00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:46.399 line:95%,end
She hasn't cried yet about
the [bleep] that's been going on.

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:47.300 line:95%,end
But wait a minute.

00:07:47.366 --> 00:07:48.734 line:95%,end
You just said that your kid doesn't cry.

00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:50.903 line:95%,end
I think that it was put it
out that she cried twice

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:51.904 line:95%,end
since she's been here, KRISTIE.

00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:53.339 line:95%,end
- When?
- Uhh.

00:07:53.406 --> 00:07:55.041 line:95%,end
Name one, about a dance.

00:07:55.107 --> 00:07:56.576 line:95%,end
- Yeah, it was about a dance.
- What about?

00:07:56.642 --> 00:07:58.010 line:95%,end
- What?
- About the duet.

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:00.346 line:95%,end
No, she didn't cry after the duet.

00:08:00.413 --> 00:08:01.414 line:95%,end
- Yes, she did.
- I thought she did.

00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:02.748 line:95%,end
KRISTIE: No, she didn't.
- Holly?

00:08:02.815 --> 00:08:05.585 line:5%,start
Apparently with Kristie,
you can take away her daughter's role

00:08:05.651 --> 00:08:08.454 line:95%,end
in dancing on a national television
talk show,

00:08:08.521 --> 00:08:10.189 line:95%,end
but don't you dare say that she cries.

00:08:10.256 --> 00:08:12.091 line:95%,end
I think Jill saw her when she came out.

00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:12.992 line:95%,end
Really?

00:08:13.059 --> 00:08:14.126 line:95%,end
Really, Kristie.

00:08:14.193 --> 00:08:15.695 line:95%,end
You can sit there and say, "Really, Jill?

00:08:15.761 --> 00:08:16.662 line:95%,end
Really? Really?

00:08:16.762 --> 00:08:17.697 line:95%,end
- Yes!
- Back up. No.

00:08:17.763 --> 00:08:19.332 line:95%,end
- After you ran in and saved her--
- Uh-huh?

00:08:19.398 --> 00:08:22.468 line:95%,end
She said, "Oh, I was crying
because I felt sad for Nia."

00:08:22.535 --> 00:08:24.437 line:95%,end
No, no, she was not crying.

00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:25.905 line:95%,end
She was crying, just face it.

00:08:25.972 --> 00:08:27.773 line:95%,end
Don't sugarcoat it, Kristie.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.642 line:95%,end
Don't put me in the same boat as you.

00:08:29.709 --> 00:08:32.445 line:95%,end
My daughter wears
her heart out on her sleeve.

00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:34.814 line:95%,end
She doesn't have to go
in the bathroom to cry--

00:08:34.881 --> 00:08:36.649 line:95%,end
- She didn't.
- --and pretend she didn't.

00:08:36.716 --> 00:08:39.719 line:95%,end
Asia felt bad that Nia got yelled at.

00:08:39.785 --> 00:08:42.655 line:95%,end
You just said Asia has a hard shell,
she doesn't cry.

00:08:42.722 --> 00:08:43.890 line:95%,end
- She cries.
- Give up.

00:08:43.956 --> 00:08:45.391 line:95%,end
Give up. You're not getting to me.

00:08:45.458 --> 00:08:47.527 line:95%,end
I'm not gonna give up because I was there.

00:08:47.593 --> 00:08:48.494 line:95%,end
Give it up.

00:08:48.561 --> 00:08:49.662 line:95%,end
You're raising your voice.

00:08:49.729 --> 00:08:50.563 line:95%,end
I don't care.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:52.465 line:95%,end
You're the one that says
it never will happen.

00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:54.033 line:95%,end
- It already happened.
- I didn't say never.

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.601 line:95%,end
I did not say never.

00:08:55.668 --> 00:08:58.437 line:95%,end
I said that my daughter's
strong enough to handle it.

00:08:58.504 --> 00:09:00.673 line:95%,end
OK, she didn't handle it the other night.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:02.275 line:95%,end
So get it straight
and don't get it twisted.

00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:03.743 line:95%,end
- And get your facts--
- It's not twisted.

00:09:03.809 --> 00:09:04.810 line:95%,end
KRISTIE: Get your facts right.

00:09:04.877 --> 00:09:07.013 line:95%,end
Get your facts right, Jill.

00:09:07.079 --> 00:09:09.348 line:95%,end
I don't mind if my child cries,
she's seven.

00:09:09.415 --> 00:09:10.616 line:95%,end
she can cry all day [bleep] long.

00:09:11.617 --> 00:09:12.952 line:95%,end
So [bleep] what?

00:09:13.352 --> 00:09:14.587 line:95%,end
Who cares?


00:09:25.898 --> 00:09:28.734 line:5%,start
MELISSA: So we're taking
the kids ice-skating today,

00:09:28.801 --> 00:09:30.570 line:5%,start
something fun for the kids.

00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:34.774 line:5%,start
I don't think this is the best thing
to do before a dance competition

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.209 line:5%,start
because Abby's going
to freak out if she finds out.

00:09:37.276 --> 00:09:38.344 line:95%,end
JILL: Here, here, here.

00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:39.378 line:95%,end
Here's a two.

00:09:39.445 --> 00:09:40.746 line:95%,end
- Who's a two?
- MELISSA: That's Maddie.

00:09:40.813 --> 00:09:41.681 line:95%,end
GIRL: Maddie.

00:09:41.747 --> 00:09:43.983 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Maddie, put your skates on.

00:09:45.418 --> 00:09:47.353 line:95%,end
I am your mother.
Put your skates on.

00:09:48.187 --> 00:09:49.889 line:95%,end
Do you know what this is about, Maddie?

00:09:49.956 --> 00:09:50.856 line:95%,end
It's about fun.

00:09:50.923 --> 00:09:51.791 line:95%,end
Have fun.

00:09:51.857 --> 00:09:53.092 line:95%,end
Stop crying.

00:09:53.159 --> 00:09:55.461 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Maddie didn't want
to ice-skate because she needs

00:09:55.528 --> 00:09:57.630 line:95%,end
to be the best at everything she does.

00:09:57.697 --> 00:10:00.766 line:95%,end
And clearly, she's not an Olympic
gold medalist in figure skating,

00:10:00.833 --> 00:10:02.001 line:95%,end
so she didn't want to skate.

00:10:04.203 --> 00:10:07.239 line:95%,end
KENDALL: Asia, Asia, why aren't you going?

00:10:08.207 --> 00:10:09.375 line:95%,end
- KENDALL: Why?
- KRISTIE: OK.

00:10:09.442 --> 00:10:10.743 line:95%,end
- She's not allowed to.
- KENDALL: Why?

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:12.011 line:95%,end
KRISTIE: 'Cause she can't be hurt.

00:10:12.244 --> 00:10:13.746 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Well, nobody can be hurt.

00:10:13.813 --> 00:10:14.814 line:95%,end
Well, I know.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.115 line:95%,end
She's not going to do it.

00:10:16.716 --> 00:10:17.550 line:95%,end
She knows why.

00:10:18.884 --> 00:10:19.785 line:95%,end
Well, it's up to you.

00:10:19.852 --> 00:10:21.520 line:95%,end
You let your kid skate if they want to.

00:10:25.224 --> 00:10:26.258 line:5%,start
I'm not playing their game.

00:10:26.325 --> 00:10:27.927 line:95%,end
I'm not playing their [bleep] game.
You're not skating.

00:10:30.997 --> 00:10:33.265 line:5%,start
Asia, you know why you can't skate.

00:10:33.332 --> 00:10:35.635 line:95%,end
JILL: She was an ice-skater,
for God's sake.

00:10:35.701 --> 00:10:38.104 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I don't know why
it's so important for Kristie

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:40.272 line:95%,end
to tell us that Asia never cries.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.308 line:95%,end
Here's some tears now for Asia.

00:10:42.375 --> 00:10:43.509 line:95%,end
I thought she didn't cry.

00:10:43.809 --> 00:10:44.977 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Here, we have to hold hands.

00:10:45.044 --> 00:10:47.380 line:95%,end
Oh, I'm not holding your hand,
you're gonna pull me down.

00:10:47.747 --> 00:10:49.849 line:95%,end
KELLY: [screams] Hold on!
Aah!

00:10:49.915 --> 00:10:50.983 line:95%,end
[bleep]

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:52.618 line:95%,end
Come on, I'll hold your hand, Maddie.

00:10:52.685 --> 00:10:55.354 line:95%,end
JILL: Chloe, I can turn like you!

00:10:55.421 --> 00:10:56.722 line:95%,end
MELISSA: Are you staying
on the wall the whole time?

00:10:56.789 --> 00:10:57.957 line:95%,end
- Yeah.
- MELISSA: I think that's good.

00:10:58.324 --> 00:10:59.325 line:95%,end
[laughs]

00:10:59.392 --> 00:11:00.459 line:95%,end
Stand up!

00:11:00.993 --> 00:11:02.028 line:95%,end
Come on.

00:11:02.094 --> 00:11:03.863 line:95%,end
Hey, You're not gonna fall on the ice.

00:11:04.163 --> 00:11:05.831 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I'm sorry, Your Highness.

00:11:05.898 --> 00:11:07.299 line:95%,end
KELLY: Oh, right into the wall!

00:11:09.268 --> 00:11:11.103 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:11:18.711 --> 00:11:19.645 line:5%,start
ANTHONY: Seven, eight.

00:11:19.712 --> 00:11:22.048 line:5%,start
One, two, foom, foom, fah, hoom.

00:11:22.448 --> 00:11:23.349 line:95%,end
Yup.

00:11:23.416 --> 00:11:26.118 line:95%,end
And so, this is where you have to evoke
that spirit, like the spell.

00:11:26.185 --> 00:11:27.019 line:95%,end
Foom!

00:11:27.086 --> 00:11:30.289 line:95%,end
CATHY: The name of the duet
is "Illusions of Dance."

00:11:30.356 --> 00:11:32.091 line:95%,end
And it's gonna be pretty magical.

00:11:33.125 --> 00:11:35.227 line:95%,end
We have two magicians.

00:11:35.294 --> 00:11:39.031 line:95%,end
One is very formally trained,
and the other magician

00:11:39.098 --> 00:11:40.800 line:95%,end
is a street magician.

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.035 line:5%,start
Boy, wouldn't it be nice
if Anthony could just

00:11:43.102 --> 00:11:44.737 line:5%,start
go "Hocus Pocus" and poof--

00:11:44.804 --> 00:11:45.705 line:5%,start
Abby disappears?

00:11:46.672 --> 00:11:47.440 line:95%,end
I could go like--

00:11:47.506 --> 00:11:49.975 line:95%,end
- Then, yeah, to go five, six, seven,
eight, yes? - Yeah.

00:11:50.042 --> 00:11:52.845 line:95%,end
- And Jalen, when you run back--
- ANTHONY: And find each other.

00:11:52.912 --> 00:11:54.013 line:95%,end
--make half circles with your feet.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.314 line:95%,end
Yeah, so when you,
when you fa-- roll on the floor--

00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:56.415 line:95%,end
Half circles.

00:12:01.353 --> 00:12:04.290 line:95%,end
Can you tell him what you need
to tell him so I can continue?

00:12:05.324 --> 00:12:07.093 line:95%,end
You're over there talking to him, Anthony.

00:12:07.159 --> 00:12:09.628 line:95%,end
I'm not gonna just stand here
and not help out.

00:12:09.695 --> 00:12:11.297 line:95%,end
We're in a time crunch, OK?

00:12:11.363 --> 00:12:12.765 line:95%,end
And I got where you're going.

00:12:12.832 --> 00:12:13.899 line:95%,end
You don't know where I'm going.

00:12:13.966 --> 00:12:15.334 line:5%,start
- CATHY: That you're the artist.
- You don't know where I'm going.

00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:16.702 line:5%,start
- Can you please be quiet?
- No.

00:12:16.769 --> 00:12:18.971 line:5%,start
ANTHONY: I'm giving them both
a note to roll on the floor,

00:12:19.038 --> 00:12:20.773 line:5%,start
and you're talking to him
while I'm talking to him.

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:24.076 line:5%,start
Listen, if I'm gonna be able to step in
to help out, that's what I'm gonna do.

00:12:24.143 --> 00:12:25.377 line:5%,start
But you don't know
what you're talking about.

00:12:25.444 --> 00:12:26.779 line:95%,end
- Oh, really? - You don't know
what you're talking about.

00:12:26.846 --> 00:12:27.747 line:95%,end
- Oh, really?
- Yes, really.

00:12:27.813 --> 00:12:28.981 line:95%,end
- I don't know what I'm talking about?
- Yes, really.

00:12:29.048 --> 00:12:30.182 line:95%,end
If you're gonna give the note--

00:12:30.249 --> 00:12:31.650 line:95%,end
ANTHONY: If you're gonna get in my face,
step out of my my face.

00:12:31.717 --> 00:12:32.685 line:95%,end
Step out of my face.

00:12:32.752 --> 00:12:34.286 line:95%,end
You want to see me in your face?

00:12:34.353 --> 00:12:35.454 line:95%,end
You will never be in my face.

00:12:35.521 --> 00:12:36.622 line:95%,end
Then don't be condescending to me.

00:12:36.689 --> 00:12:38.290 line:95%,end
- You will never be in my face.
- Don't be condescending to me.

00:12:38.357 --> 00:12:39.725 line:95%,end
- You will never be in my face.
- OK.

00:12:39.792 --> 00:12:42.695 line:95%,end
Then don't tell me not to get in your face
if I'm not in your face.

00:12:44.697 --> 00:12:46.532 line:5%,start
ABBY LEE: Asia, we're
going to start with her.

00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:48.734 line:5%,start
And you all are going to do 100 push-ups.

00:12:50.236 --> 00:12:52.738 line:95%,end
She doesn't have to do the 100 push-ups
'cause she didn't ice-skate.

00:12:53.906 --> 00:12:58.310 line:95%,end
You were selfish, you were naive,

00:12:58.377 --> 00:13:00.212 line:95%,end
and you put this entire group in jeopardy.


00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:02.615 line:95%,end
I found out the girls went ice-skating.

00:13:02.681 --> 00:13:05.818 line:95%,end
The Abby Lee Dance Company
contract is very specific.

00:13:05.885 --> 00:13:06.886 line:95%,end
No ice-skating.

and the choreography and all the money

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.629 line:95%,end
that's gone into doing a competition.

00:13:17.163 --> 00:13:18.497 line:95%,end

Asia has an amazing solo this week.

It's called "The Robot."

00:13:27.239 --> 00:13:30.876 line:95%,end
And it's going to be hard
to keep her a little stiff,

00:13:30.943 --> 00:13:31.877 line:95%,end
but we're gonna try.

00:13:32.478 --> 00:13:34.180 line:95%,end
JILL: Look, all the
girls are doing push-ups

00:13:34.246 --> 00:13:35.514 line:95%,end

00:13:35.581 --> 00:13:36.782 line:95%,end
What's that about?

00:13:36.849 --> 00:13:37.850 line:95%,end
Did the kids have a really good time?

00:13:37.917 --> 00:13:39.018 line:95%,end
- They did.
- That's all that matters.

00:13:39.084 --> 00:13:41.787 line:95%,end
Sometimes they have
to just be kids, like--

00:13:41.854 --> 00:13:43.689 line:95%,end
- Enjoy their childhood.
- For God's sake.

KELLY: Abby's sitting here
making these kids do push-ups

00:13:46.192 --> 00:13:47.726 line:95%,end
because they went ice-skating.

00:13:47.793 --> 00:13:50.429 line:95%,end
Abby, what did you do while
the kids were ice-skating?

00:13:50.496 --> 00:13:51.697 line:95%,end
Did you maybe go for dinner?

00:13:51.764 --> 00:13:54.099 line:95%,end
Maybe you should be doing
the sit-ups and the push-ups.

00:13:54.166 --> 00:13:55.234 line:95%,end
I still stand.

00:13:55.301 --> 00:13:58.170 line:95%,end
Asia knows, and she's not
going ice-skate two days

00:13:58.237 --> 00:14:02.341 line:95%,end

can't be 100% sure an accident

won't happen on the ice.

00:14:03.676 --> 00:14:04.877 line:95%,end
That's not what you said yesterday.

00:14:04.944 --> 00:14:05.811 line:95%,end
Well, I'm telling you now.

00:14:05.878 --> 00:14:08.547 line:95%,end
After thinking about it,
we have two days out for a show.

00:14:08.614 --> 00:14:09.882 line:95%,end
You want to just take that chance?

00:14:09.949 --> 00:14:11.050 line:95%,end
I don't, as a mother.

00:14:11.116 --> 00:14:12.585 line:95%,end
My daughter's a dancer.

00:14:12.952 --> 00:14:14.587 line:95%,end
Why are you getting all bent out of shape?

00:14:14.653 --> 00:14:15.855 line:95%,end
Nobody's asked you.

00:14:15.921 --> 00:14:17.823 line:95%,end
- Christi. Look at me when you talk.
- Yes, I'm speaking.

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:18.991 line:95%,end
Look at me when you talk.

00:14:19.058 --> 00:14:19.959 line:95%,end
Excuse me?

00:14:20.025 --> 00:14:21.627 line:95%,end
Look at me when you talk!
CHRISTI: Excuse me.

00:14:21.694 --> 00:14:23.896 line:95%,end
- Excuse me.
- I don't want to look at you when I talk!

00:14:23.963 --> 00:14:25.030 line:95%,end
Well, then don't talk to me.

00:14:25.097 --> 00:14:26.298 line:95%,end
Well, then don't talk to us.

00:14:26.365 --> 00:14:28.167 line:95%,end
- Nobody asked you!
- I'm answering a question.

00:14:28.234 --> 00:14:29.535 line:95%,end
Nobody asked you a question.

00:14:29.602 --> 00:14:32.104 line:95%,end
Yes, you did.
You just asked me a [bleep] question!

00:14:32.171 --> 00:14:33.405 line:95%,end
You need to settle yourself down.

00:14:33.472 --> 00:14:34.707 line:95%,end
KRISTIE: No, I don't. 'Cause guess what?

00:14:34.773 --> 00:14:35.708 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: You need to settle yourself down.

00:14:35.774 --> 00:14:37.676 line:95%,end
You look at me when you talk to me.
Don't look at your phone.

00:14:37.743 --> 00:14:38.577 line:95%,end
Look at me!

00:14:38.644 --> 00:14:39.979 line:95%,end
Don't you tell me what to do!

00:14:40.045 --> 00:14:41.347 line:95%,end
KRISTIE: I'm telling you what to do!

00:14:41.413 --> 00:14:43.415 line:95%,end
It's important that if
someone is gonna talk to me

00:14:43.515 --> 00:14:46.151 line:5%,start
and ask me a question,
is that they look me in the eye.

00:14:46.218 --> 00:14:49.421 line:5%,start
Not ask me a question
and look away and then make faces.

00:14:49.488 --> 00:14:50.723 line:95%,end
It's disrespectful,

00:14:50.789 --> 00:14:52.791 line:95%,end
and you're not gonna do it
when you're talking to me.

00:14:52.858 --> 00:14:54.460 line:95%,end
I'm sorry that you guys are miserable!

00:14:54.827 --> 00:14:56.095 line:95%,end
- We're not miserable.
- KRISTIE: You guys are miserable!

00:14:56.161 --> 00:14:57.263 line:95%,end
Our kids are happy.

00:14:57.329 --> 00:14:59.031 line:95%,end
Then look at me when you talk to me!

00:14:59.098 --> 00:15:02.268 line:95%,end
I don't want to look
at you when I talk to you!

00:15:02.334 --> 00:15:05.437 line:95%,end
You guys are so caught up on,
"Oh my, God,"

00:15:05.504 --> 00:15:08.207 line:95%,end
complaining about every
little [bleep] that happens.

00:15:08.274 --> 00:15:11.043 line:95%,end
I don't know why you're
being so emotional about this.

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:12.945 line:95%,end
Because Christi and Jill bring it up,

00:15:13.012 --> 00:15:15.581 line:95%,end
and then Christi's over there,
standing there, making faces

00:15:15.648 --> 00:15:17.249 line:95%,end
like, "Oh, my God, I can't
believe she's saying that.

00:15:17.316 --> 00:15:18.183 line:95%,end
- "Oh my God."
- I can't.

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:19.718 line:95%,end
But then you can't look
me in the eye and then--

00:15:19.785 --> 00:15:20.753 line:95%,end
I"m looking you in the eye, bitch.

00:15:20.819 --> 00:15:22.922 line:95%,end
Bitch, let's go. Let's go.

00:15:22.988 --> 00:15:24.356 line:95%,end
- I'm not that way.
- Sit down.

00:15:24.423 --> 00:15:25.557 line:95%,end
Exactly, so don't call me a
bitch if you can't back it up!

00:15:25.624 --> 00:15:26.692 line:95%,end
I'm not that way.

00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:27.826 line:95%,end
- Settle yourself down.
- No, I don't. 

00:15:27.893 --> 00:15:29.995 line:95%,end
Do not call me a bitch
if you can't back it up.

00:15:30.062 --> 00:15:32.298 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: I can back it up,
but I don't fight like that.

00:15:32.364 --> 00:15:34.066 line:95%,end
OK, then don't use those words towards me.

00:15:34.133 --> 00:15:37.269 line:95%,end
I think Kristie is going to
knock the other Christi out.

00:15:37.336 --> 00:15:38.871 line:95%,end
And I'm just like, "Stay away.

00:15:38.938 --> 00:15:40.973 line:95%,end
"I don't fight. I'm a lover,
not a fighter."

00:15:43.442 --> 00:15:44.910 line:95%,end
- Watch your tongue!
- Get your finger away from me.

00:15:44.977 --> 00:15:46.078 line:95%,end
I'm telling you, watch your tongue.

00:15:46.145 --> 00:15:47.646 line:95%,end

- What, are you gonna hit me?

00:15:47.713 --> 00:15:49.281 line:95%,end
- Watch your tongue.
- What, are you gonna hit me?

00:15:49.348 --> 00:15:50.182 line:95%,end
Watch your tongue.

00:15:50.249 --> 00:15:51.450 line:95%,end
- CHRISTI: Are you going to hit me?
- Watch your tongue.

00:15:51.517 --> 00:15:53.319 line:95%,end
You don't tell me what to do.
What, are you gonna hit me?

00:15:53.385 --> 00:15:54.386 line:95%,end
Watch your tongue.

00:15:56.188 --> 00:15:58.157 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: No, I love her.
I hope she slaps her in the face.

00:15:58.223 --> 00:16:01.694 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Why am I the one in trouble
when this is going like this?

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:02.995 line:95%,end
Why are you so violent?

00:16:03.062 --> 00:16:04.997 line:95%,end
I'm not violent.
You just-- you just don't--

00:16:05.064 --> 00:16:06.398 line:95%,end
you just don't know how to handle me.

00:16:06.465 --> 00:16:07.499 line:95%,end

Save it, Christi, save it.

Save it.

Save it, OK?

00:16:23.282 --> 00:16:24.183 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: You save it.

00:16:24.249 --> 00:16:25.084 line:95%,end
Save it.

00:16:26.785 --> 00:16:27.953 line:95%,end
I'm not looking way now, am I?

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:29.455 line:95%,end
Good. Now I taught you a lesson.

00:16:30.155 --> 00:16:32.458 line:95%,end
You taught me how I don't want to behave.

00:16:32.791 --> 00:16:33.625 line:95%,end
Save it.

00:16:33.826 --> 00:16:34.727 line:95%,end
Sorry.

being an amazing dancer

not even show up.

00:18:59.238 --> 00:19:01.039 line:95%,end
Last time she was pretty smug.

It's tough to get there
it's harder to stay there.

00:19:02.941 --> 00:19:03.809 line:95%,end
She's probably thinking--

00:19:03.876 --> 00:19:05.377 line:95%,end
HOLLY: No.
I think she's pretty kind of confident.

00:19:05.444 --> 00:19:07.012 line:95%,end
That's what I said.
She's pretty smug.

00:19:07.079 --> 00:19:09.214 line:95%,end
She probably thinks she--
she doesn't need to be here

00:19:09.314 --> 00:19:11.583 line:95%,end
because she has it all wrapped up.

00:19:12.384 --> 00:19:13.352 line:95%,end
Yeah.

Have you guys heard from Cathy?

You're going to be our fearless leader.

JILL: That's Buzz Lightyear.

Careful!

00:19:53.358 --> 00:19:54.393 line:95%,end
Keep your ankles together.

00:19:54.459 --> 00:19:55.661 line:95%,end
You look pigeon toed
when you're doing that.

00:19:55.727 --> 00:19:57.329 line:95%,end
Are we ready to go? You two ready to go?

00:19:57.396 --> 00:19:58.230 line:95%,end
JILL: Yeah.

00:19:58.297 --> 00:20:00.265 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: The solos are up first.

00:20:00.332 --> 00:20:04.736 line:95%,end
If they let the wicked
witch's boys get to them,

00:20:04.803 --> 00:20:06.538 line:95%,end
they're going to crack under the pressure.

00:20:06.972 --> 00:20:09.608 line:95%,end
And the
Abby Lee Dance Company doesn't crack.

00:20:10.209 --> 00:20:13.212 line:95%,end
You understand that the judges
have seen a whole bunch of stuff--

00:20:13.278 --> 00:20:16.181 line:95%,end
maybe some great,
maybe some not so great.

00:20:16.248 --> 00:20:18.383 line:95%,end
All right?
So you come out doing something exciting.

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:19.585 line:95%,end
You wake them up.

00:20:19.651 --> 00:20:21.353 line:95%,end
But it has to be done well.

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:22.554 line:95%,end
Yes?

00:20:23.989 --> 00:20:26.358 line:95%,end
You know what your mistakes are.
You know what you do wrong.

00:20:26.425 --> 00:20:27.993 line:95%,end
I don't need to remind you of them.

00:20:28.727 --> 00:20:31.163 line:95%,end
Just don't regret the performance.

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:34.433 line:95%,end
Come off saying, "That was the
best I could have done today."

MELISSA: Abby puts Maddie and Chloe

It's a good competition, though.

00:20:39.438 --> 00:20:41.807 line:5%,start
They really make each other work harder.

00:20:42.107 --> 00:20:43.675 line:95%,end
Chloe definitely can beat Maddie.

00:20:43.742 --> 00:20:45.344 line:95%,end
Maddie can definitely be Chloe any week.

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:46.645 line:95%,end
It goes both ways.

00:20:46.712 --> 00:20:49.348 line:95%,end

I have to say something.

If love is illegal,
guess I'm guilty of love crimes.

there was nothing mechanical going on.

[cheering and applause]

00:29:13.785 --> 00:29:16.254 line:95%,end
All right. We're playing the music.
Run it in your head.

00:29:17.355 --> 00:29:18.957 line:95%,end
Whoa.
You OK?

00:29:19.657 --> 00:29:21.893 line:95%,end
This is a really important number for me.

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:25.096 line:95%,end
And I want not only my
kids to learn a lesson,

00:29:25.163 --> 00:29:27.899 line:95%,end
but maybe to teach the people
in the audience a lesson.

00:29:28.666 --> 00:29:32.937 line:95%,end
I want you up so high on those feet.
Yes! Big, dramatic boom!

00:29:33.438 --> 00:29:35.673 line:95%,end
Bah! And I want to beat Cathy, too.

00:29:36.207 --> 00:29:38.843 line:95%,end
And a number like this can do it.

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:40.879 line:95%,end
Hey. So we're getting makeup done.

00:29:41.412 --> 00:29:42.747 line:95%,end
Oh, my gosh.

00:29:43.047 --> 00:29:44.582 line:95%,end
Haunting.

00:29:44.649 --> 00:29:46.451 line:95%,end
[laughs] Oh, Brandon!

00:29:46.551 --> 00:29:47.952 line:95%,end
Oh, my goodness!

00:29:48.253 --> 00:29:50.622 line:95%,end
I think that this number
has the total package.

00:29:51.055 --> 00:29:54.993 line:95%,end
We've got fabulous costumes
that Anthony has went all out on.

00:29:55.293 --> 00:29:58.563 line:95%,end
I think that the choreography is fresh.

00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:59.898 line:95%,end
Oh, my gosh!

00:29:59.964 --> 00:30:01.232 line:95%,end
She looks like a KISS girl!

00:30:01.299 --> 00:30:02.133 line:95%,end
[laughter]

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.101 line:95%,end
Oh, my gosh.

00:30:03.168 --> 00:30:05.103 line:95%,end
- MAN: Gina Simmons!
- That is awesome.

00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:07.038 line:95%,end
- Yup, it's brilliant.
- ANTHONY: Now let's run this number.

00:30:07.105 --> 00:30:09.674 line:95%,end
Come on. Let's run--
let's run it, real fast.

00:30:10.308 --> 00:30:11.609 line:95%,end
Stronger, guys.

00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:14.245 line:95%,end
Watch that curtain, that you don't fall.

00:30:14.312 --> 00:30:17.215 line:95%,end
I definitely think that
we stand a huge chance

00:30:17.282 --> 00:30:19.450 line:95%,end
to beat the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:30:19.517 --> 00:30:20.819 line:95%,end
All right, guys, we got to go.

00:30:20.885 --> 00:30:22.220 line:95%,end
We got to go.
We're good. We're good.

00:30:22.287 --> 00:30:24.889 line:95%,end
Hey. Let's get in one more pep talk, guys.
Come on.

00:30:25.223 --> 00:30:27.258 line:95%,end
- Hey, hey, hey, come on.
- CATHY: You're good. Got to do this.

00:30:27.325 --> 00:30:28.960 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: Girls, "The Last Text"--

00:30:29.027 --> 00:30:31.095 line:95%,end
everybody got chills.

00:30:31.162 --> 00:30:34.666 line:95%,end
When we heard the crash, we knew
we had a winner on our hands.

00:30:34.732 --> 00:30:36.467 line:95%,end
The schools talked to you about it.

00:30:36.634 --> 00:30:38.469 line:95%,end
"Runaways"-- yes?

00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:41.606 line:95%,end
You all are aware of this.

00:30:41.673 --> 00:30:43.541 line:95%,end
Let's make them all aware.

00:30:43.608 --> 00:30:48.313 line:95%,end
A teacher's success is based solely
on the success of her students.

00:30:50.281 --> 00:30:51.749 line:95%,end
Cathy doesn't have any success.

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:53.852 line:95%,end
ANNOUNCER: Next to the stage
is act number 51.

00:30:53.918 --> 00:30:55.720 line:5%,start
This is a Junior Open Small Group.

00:30:55.787 --> 00:30:58.790 line:5%,start

"Dia de los Muertos."

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:17.468 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I'm so nervous
about the group dance.

00:32:17.936 --> 00:32:21.839 line:95%,end
The girls have a ton of pressure
because Cathy and her boys are here.

00:32:22.106 --> 00:32:24.309 line:95%,end
Group dance is the most important thing,

00:32:24.742 --> 00:32:26.311 line:95%,end
and this has to go well.

00:32:26.377 --> 00:32:27.211 line:95%,end
ANNOUNCER: All right.

00:32:27.278 --> 00:32:30.048 line:95%,end
Next to the stage is act number 50.

[music palying]

00:32:35.153 --> 00:32:36.120 line:95%,end
All right.

00:32:36.187 --> 00:32:38.623 line:95%,end
Next to the stage is act number 50.

00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:40.792 line:95%,end
This is a Junior Open Small Group.

00:32:40.858 --> 00:32:42.994 line:95%,end
Put your hands together for act number 50.

[music playing]

00:33:12.824 --> 00:33:13.558 line:95%,end
What did you say?

00:33:13.624 --> 00:33:15.994 line:95%,end
The kid in the red--
red pants did know what they were doing?

00:33:17.128 --> 00:33:18.930 line:5%,start
CATHY: I wasn't-- no, that's Paige.

00:33:18.997 --> 00:33:21.132 line:95%,end
Paige generally doesn't
know what she's doing.

00:33:22.333 --> 00:33:24.302 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I'm watching the number,

00:33:24.369 --> 00:33:28.172 line:5%,start
and Anthony and Cathy are talking
bad about Paige.

00:33:28.806 --> 00:33:30.808 line:5%,start
I mean, loud. I could hear it,

00:33:30.875 --> 00:33:32.276 line:5%,start
and it was really ticking me off.

00:33:33.611 --> 00:33:36.114 line:95%,end
It's obvious you put your
best dancer out in front.

00:33:36.381 --> 00:33:37.849 line:95%,end
So you watch the back line.

00:33:54.766 --> 00:33:57.568 line:95%,end
[cheering and applause]

00:34:03.641 --> 00:34:05.443 line:95%,end
[indistinct chatter]

00:34:08.813 --> 00:34:10.715 line:5%,start
ABBY LEE: I summoned
Paige down off the stage.

00:34:17.255 --> 00:34:20.758 line:95%,end
I thought that if Paige stood up
to them and looked at this man

00:34:20.858 --> 00:34:24.162 line:95%,end
and said, "If you have something to say,
say it to my face,"

00:34:24.228 --> 00:34:27.565 line:5%,start
that he would rationally,
as a grown adult, say,

00:34:27.632 --> 00:34:30.468 line:95%,end
"Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
I won't say anything else."

00:34:30.535 --> 00:34:31.569 line:95%,end
I really did.

00:34:31.636 --> 00:34:32.570 line:95%,end
But it didn't look like it.

00:34:32.637 --> 00:34:34.172 line:95%,end
I guess because you
were close to the wing,

00:34:34.238 --> 00:34:36.441 line:95%,end
it looked like you were, you know,
about to hit the wing.

00:34:36.507 --> 00:34:37.842 line:95%,end
So it showed on your face.

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:39.577 line:95%,end
- And, I mean--
- ABBY LEE: Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

00:34:39.644 --> 00:34:41.412 line:95%,end
KELLY: You're not her dance teacher,
so don't give her critiques.

00:34:41.479 --> 00:34:42.513 line:95%,end
ANTHONY: I'm not her dance teacher.
That's why I didn't give her any.

00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:43.414 line:95%,end
- Leave her alone.
- CATHY: But you know what?

00:34:43.481 --> 00:34:45.149 line:95%,end
Paige, please go up on the thing.
He's rude.

00:34:45.216 --> 00:34:46.084 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: You've been ripping
on her since you sat down.

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:47.118 line:95%,end
- So what?
- CATHY: But he was talking to me.

00:34:47.185 --> 00:34:48.352 line:95%,end
- Don't rip on my daughter.
- I'm giving her critiques.

00:34:48.419 --> 00:34:50.488 line:95%,end
- She's 11 years old.
- ANTHONY: I'm not. She does it enough.

00:34:50.555 --> 00:34:51.389 line:95%,end
She does it enough.

00:34:51.456 --> 00:34:53.257 line:95%,end
- Yeah, I pay her for her critiquing--
- ANTHONY: Good. Good.

00:34:53.324 --> 00:34:54.158 line:95%,end
And you should--
- --not you.

00:34:54.225 --> 00:34:55.159 line:95%,end
Maybe you should get a refund.

00:34:55.226 --> 00:34:57.228 line:95%,end
Maybe you should get a refund
because those knees were bent

00:34:57.295 --> 00:34:59.330 line:95%,end
- and she missed many a steps.
- Yeah?

00:34:59.397 --> 00:35:01.099 line:95%,end
Well, at least my daughter
can get out there and dance.

00:35:01.165 --> 00:35:02.934 line:95%,end
Your daughter can't.
She's sick every week.

00:35:04.168 --> 00:35:06.037 line:95%,end
PAIGE: I didn't really care
that he was giving me corrections

00:35:06.104 --> 00:35:08.072 line:95%,end
because I like getting
crutches from other people

00:35:08.139 --> 00:35:09.841 line:95%,end
because it makes you a better dancer.

00:35:09.907 --> 00:35:11.409 line:5%,start
I just didn't like that he did it

00:35:11.476 --> 00:35:14.979 line:5%,start
in front of the whole audience
because it kind of got me embarrassed.

00:35:15.379 --> 00:35:16.681 line:95%,end
It's was only the truth, Abby.

00:35:16.747 --> 00:35:17.982 line:95%,end
That's all I was-- you know, I'm not--

00:35:18.049 --> 00:35:19.417 line:95%,end
I'm not saying
and it's not nothing against you.

00:35:19.484 --> 00:35:22.587 line:95%,end
You know what? Let's call Katy Perry
and see what she has to say about you.

00:35:22.653 --> 00:35:23.721 line:95%,end
- I quit. That's what happened.
- [laughs]

00:35:23.788 --> 00:35:25.423 line:95%,end
- I quit.
- Yeah, or got fired. Figure it out.

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:26.891 line:95%,end
Never. I've never, ever got--
CATHY: Oh, right.

00:35:26.958 --> 00:35:28.593 line:95%,end
never, ever got fired from a job.

00:35:28.659 --> 00:35:31.362 line:95%,end
Check my resume, boo.
That's why I continue to work.

00:35:31.863 --> 00:35:33.331 line:95%,end
I continue to work.

00:35:33.397 --> 00:35:35.500 line:95%,end
KELLY: Cathy, you talk about kids.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.935 line:95%,end
- We never talk mean about your kids.
- WOMAN: You talked about Vivi.

00:35:38.002 --> 00:35:41.105 line:95%,end
- You guys critiqued the whole thing.
- Because she said something about my kid.

00:35:41.172 --> 00:35:44.208 line:95%,end
- Was sitting there talking about
Vivi-Anne? - No, I wasn't.

00:35:44.275 --> 00:35:45.409 line:95%,end
No, she didn't-- no one
said anything about your kid.

00:35:45.476 --> 00:35:48.212 line:95%,end
- Abby called her off the stage.
- Because you're talking about her.

00:35:48.279 --> 00:35:49.947 line:95%,end
- I wasn't talking about her. I was--
- Yes, you were.

00:35:50.181 --> 00:35:53.384 line:95%,end
I said she was lurking on the fence,
which is true. She was lurking.

00:35:53.451 --> 00:35:54.619 line:95%,end
All right, look--

00:35:55.119 --> 00:35:56.854 line:95%,end
this is a dance competition.

00:35:56.921 --> 00:36:00.324 line:95%,end
This is my livelihood you either
need to leave the premises

00:36:00.391 --> 00:36:02.460 line:95%,end
or you need to act like
a lady and a gentleman.

00:36:02.527 --> 00:36:04.228 line:95%,end
I've had it. Enough!

00:36:04.295 --> 00:36:05.429 line:95%,end
You know what then, Abby?

00:36:05.496 --> 00:36:06.330 line:95%,end
What are you talking about?

00:36:06.998 --> 00:36:08.966 line:95%,end
MELISSA: When you mess with
one of our team members,

00:36:09.033 --> 00:36:10.101 line:95%,end
it really makes me angry.

00:36:10.768 --> 00:36:12.270 line:95%,end
We protect one another.

00:36:12.336 --> 00:36:14.438 line:95%,end
And I'm telling you,
she's sticking up for Paige.

00:36:14.639 --> 00:36:17.508 line:95%,end
All right. Ladies and gentlemen,
I think we're ready to begin awards.

00:36:17.575 --> 00:36:18.643 line:95%,end
[cheering and applause]

00:36:18.709 --> 00:36:20.912 line:95%,end
In the Mini Solo Division of competition,

00:36:20.978 --> 00:36:23.381 line:95%,end
in third place

And your high scoring Elite Mini Soloist

00:36:37.528 --> 00:36:41.866 line:95%,end
with a score of 281.4 points is
Miss Asia with act number 12,

00:36:41.933 --> 00:36:42.800 line:95%,end
"The Robot."

00:36:42.867 --> 00:36:44.936 line:95%,end
[cheering and applause]

00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:50.074 line:5%,start
KRISTIE: Asia gets the first place overall
and the Judges Choice Award.

00:36:50.141 --> 00:36:52.243 line:5%,start
So, moms, I know you don't want us here.

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:54.612 line:95%,end
You say that Asia is this
and Asia is that.

00:36:54.679 --> 00:36:57.381 line:95%,end
But right now, we're leaving New York
and we're winners.

00:37:00.051 --> 00:37:03.221 line:95%,end
All right. We're moving into our
Elite Junior Solo Division of competition.


00:37:03.287 --> 00:37:05.756 line:95%,end
Ladies and gentlemen,
there was a tie for second place.

00:37:06.157 --> 00:37:09.827 line:95%,end
At Masters of Dance,
ties are broken by the technique score.

00:37:09.894 --> 00:37:14.599 line:95%,end
So with that, third place,
with a score of 278.6 points

00:37:14.665 --> 00:37:17.602 line:95%,end
is Miss Chloe with act number 39,

[cheering and applause]

00:37:20.304 --> 00:37:25.042 line:5%,start
And your first runner up,
with the same scored of 278.6

00:37:25.343 --> 00:37:28.045 line:95%,end
but a higher technique score
goes to Mr. Zack

00:37:28.112 --> 00:37:30.915 line:95%,end
with act number 33, "Resuscitate."

00:37:30.982 --> 00:37:31.816 line:95%,end
[cheering and applause]

00:37:32.316 --> 00:37:36.520 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: So we have a tie,
but they give Chloe third and Zack second.

00:37:36.587 --> 00:37:40.057 line:95%,end
They use the technical score
to break the tie.

00:37:41.058 --> 00:37:47.298 line:95%,end
So showmanship, choreography,
presentation, technique.

00:37:47.465 --> 00:37:49.600 line:95%,end
Come on, Chloe, what about your technique?

ABBY LEE: It kills me that Cathy beat me.

00:39:05.743 --> 00:39:08.112 line:95%,end
But I have to put it all into perspective.

00:39:08.379 --> 00:39:09.914 line:95%,end
Cathy didn't beat me.

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:11.949 line:95%,end
One little girl that she stole,

00:39:12.016 --> 00:39:16.020 line:95%,end
three boys from around the country
and a guest choreographer beat me.

00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:17.822 line:95%,end
That, I can handle.

00:39:17.888 --> 00:39:21.292 line:95%,end
I thought the group dance was good.

00:39:21.359 --> 00:39:24.362 line:95%,end
I-- I really did. I just wish we wouldn't
have screamed and yelled at the end.

00:39:24.428 --> 00:39:25.262 line:95%,end
I regret that.

00:39:25.329 --> 00:39:27.164 line:95%,end
Do you think everybody
was together in the group dance?

00:39:27.231 --> 00:39:28.933 line:95%,end
No. I thought Asia was a hot mess.

00:39:28.999 --> 00:39:30.067 line:95%,end
She was ridiculous.

00:39:30.935 --> 00:39:32.203 line:95%,end
Choreography is here.

00:39:32.269 --> 00:39:36.140 line:95%,end
When it moves this way, whoever
is on this end ends up in the middle.

00:39:36.507 --> 00:39:39.310 line:95%,end
- KRISTIE: Well, Abby--
- Asia was in the wings, on the right.

00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:42.413 line:95%,end
Asia ruined the group dance.

00:39:43.214 --> 00:39:45.449 line:95%,end
However, I don't know where
those judges were looking,

00:39:45.516 --> 00:39:46.751 line:95%,end
and I don't know what they saw.

00:39:49.587 --> 00:39:51.355 line:95%,end
CATHY: Hey, Ab, how you doing?

00:39:51.989 --> 00:39:54.225 line:95%,end
Big one for the Apples this week, huh?

00:39:54.859 --> 00:39:55.693 line:95%,end
Get ready.

00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:56.927 line:95%,end
Guess what, Abby?

00:39:57.461 --> 00:39:59.730 line:95%,end
Everybody knows who Candy Apples is.

00:39:59.797 --> 00:40:00.631 line:95%,end
And you know what?

00:40:00.698 --> 00:40:02.566 line:95%,end
You're going to go down every week.

00:40:02.633 --> 00:40:03.901 line:95%,end
Because you know why?

00:40:03.968 --> 00:40:08.172 line:95%,end
You're not only rude to people,
you're rude to children.

00:40:08.239 --> 00:40:09.940 line:95%,end
You did that to poor Paige.

00:40:10.007 --> 00:40:12.510 line:95%,end
Don't put your hands on your
waist at me and look pitiful.

00:40:12.576 --> 00:40:13.744 line:95%,end
You set that up.

00:40:13.811 --> 00:40:15.880 line:95%,end
You're rude and you're going down.

00:40:15.946 --> 00:40:18.449 line:95%,end
Nobody cares about Abby Lee anymore.

00:40:18.516 --> 00:40:20.484 line:95%,end
[cheering and applause]

00:40:20.551 --> 00:40:21.719 line:95%,end
BOY: Apple Core!

00:40:21.786 --> 00:40:22.720 line:95%,end
Apple Core!

00:40:22.787 --> 00:40:23.721 line:95%,end
Apple Core!

00:40:24.255 --> 00:40:26.891 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: Cathy was victorious this time,
I'll give her that.

00:40:26.957 --> 00:40:29.326 line:95%,end
But it didn't have anything
to do with her skills.

00:40:29.393 --> 00:40:32.730 line:95%,end
Cathy had nothing to do with that number.

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:36.133 line:95%,end
Cathy, it's not going to happen again.

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:37.768 line:95%,end
I just did want to say one thing.

00:40:38.569 --> 00:40:39.904 line:95%,end
I want you all to know--

00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:42.072 line:95%,end
I don't want you to hear
rumors and blah, blah, blah.

00:40:42.139 --> 00:40:45.176 line:95%,end
But I am looking for property in LA.

00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:47.912 line:95%,end
I'll be doing that next week.

00:40:47.978 --> 00:40:49.980 line:95%,end
- MELISSA: What-- for-- to buy a studio?
- Yes.

00:40:50.981 --> 00:40:52.516 line:95%,end
Does that mean you're moving?

00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:57.421 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE (VOICEOVER):
Next on "Dance Moms"--

00:40:57.488 --> 00:41:00.558 line:5%,start
ABBY LEE: Brooke, these people
are serious about their dancing.

00:41:00.624 --> 00:41:01.592 line:5%,start
Don't be the weakest link.

00:41:01.659 --> 00:41:03.727 line:5%,start

Kelly, and you know it.

00:41:03.794 --> 00:41:05.796 line:5%,start
KELLY: Oh, well,
maybe you should get [bleep]..

00:41:05.863 --> 00:41:07.765 line:5%,start
[bleep] you, Kelly. [bleep] you.

00:41:07.832 --> 00:41:10.334 line:5%,start
ABBY LEE: You're skinny,
you're blonde, you're pretty.

00:41:10.801 --> 00:41:12.670 line:5%,start
You're telling me nobody
at school hates you?

00:41:13.304 --> 00:41:14.171 line:5%,start
Wake up.

00:41:14.572 --> 00:41:15.806 line:5%,start
MAN: You don't have to baby these boys.

00:41:15.873 --> 00:41:17.741 line:5%,start
A little physical exercise
don't hurt them at all.

00:41:17.808 --> 00:41:18.809 line:5%,start
- I'm taking care--
- Come here.

00:41:18.876 --> 00:41:21.111 line:5%,start
Come here. Come here.
Don't-- don't--

00:41:21.345 --> 00:41:22.179 line:5%,start
Shut up!

00:41:22.246 --> 00:41:24.114 line:5%,start
What the [bleep] does
it have to do with Jill?

00:41:24.181 --> 00:41:25.883 line:5%,start
What is wrong with you?

00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:27.618 line:5%,start
I hope they lose.
