JEFF: Coming up
on "Dance Moms Tell-All Reunion."

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.739 line:5%,start
Chloe gets beat all the time.
You make sure of that.

00:00:05.805 --> 00:00:07.007 line:5%,start
Not by Kendall.

00:00:07.073 --> 00:00:08.274 line:5%,start
You can go ahead and lie about that,

00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:09.376 line:5%,start
but you know that wasn't the problem.

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:10.610 line:5%,start
You know what? You don't want to go there.

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:14.180 line:5%,start
It was disrespectful saying
she has to hide behind a mask.

00:00:14.247 --> 00:00:16.783 line:5%,start
I did not wanna see
my daughter humiliated.

00:00:16.916 --> 00:00:18.818 line:5%,start
I pay Abby to critique my child.

00:00:18.885 --> 00:00:22.455 line:5%,start
You act as though
this 90-pound weakling beat you up.

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:25.291 line:5%,start
When you strike another person,
you have crossed the line.

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:26.726 line:5%,start
It was a swat. I swatted you,

00:00:26.793 --> 00:00:28.328 line:5%,start
and it probably didn't even hurt.

00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:29.796 line:5%,start
- I'm finished.
- No, no, no.

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:31.331 line:5%,start
- She's not-- No, no, no. No, no, no.
- Yeah, yep, yep, yep.

00:00:31.398 --> 00:00:33.099 line:5%,start
- She--
- She's threatened by me.

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:35.135 line:95%,end
That's the end of that.

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:36.503 line:95%,end

00:00:39.472 --> 00:00:40.507 line:95%,end
Nice job, Chloe!

00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:41.775 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Come on, Chlo. We're done.

00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:43.009 line:95%,end
Get away from me!

00:00:43.076 --> 00:00:44.978 line:95%,end
You are a monstrosity of evil.

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:46.813 line:95%,end
- [bleep] you.
- [bleep] you.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.416 line:95%,end
Bitch, you don't want to go there with me.
I will show you--

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:51.451 line:95%,end
Tonight, you guys have the chance

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:53.319 line:95%,end
to set the record straight
on so many things.

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:54.454 line:95%,end
- You were being a bitch, too.
- You know what?

00:00:54.521 --> 00:00:56.623 line:95%,end
- You don't want to go there.
- You make [bleep] up all the time.

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:57.924 line:95%,end
I don't regret what I did.

00:00:57.991 --> 00:00:59.426 line:95%,end
Abby set your kid up.

00:00:59.492 --> 00:01:00.593 line:95%,end
[suspenseful music]

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.362 line:95%,end
JEFF: Do you think you're
going to bring it tonight?

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:03.997 line:95%,end
I might have left it at home.

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:06.132 line:95%,end
Something tells me.
I felt it when I walked in.

00:01:06.199 --> 00:01:07.667 line:95%,end
- All right, don't take too long.
- HOLLY: OK.

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:09.002 line:95%,end
- All right.
- I'll see you guys downstairs.

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:10.470 line:95%,end
- See you soon.
- All right.

00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:14.441 line:95%,end
[THEME - NIKKO LOWE, "LIVING ON
THE DANCE FLOOR"]

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:16.309 line:95%,end
(SINGING) Get up.

00:01:16.376 --> 00:01:18.111 line:95%,end
Get on the floor.

00:01:18.178 --> 00:01:21.014 line:95%,end
My world is with my girls.

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:23.716 line:95%,end
Living on the dance floor.

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:27.387 line:95%,end
[cheering]

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:33.126 line:5%,start
Hi, I'm Jeff Collins.

00:01:33.193 --> 00:01:35.295 line:5%,start
Welcome to "Dance Moms Tell All."

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:37.430 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:01:37.497 --> 00:01:40.500 line:95%,end
After a wild season,
the Dance Moms finally have their chance

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:41.701 line:95%,end
to answer your questions.

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:43.903 line:95%,end
We've seen Christi
and Kelly's relationship

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.572 line:95%,end
explode right before our very eyes.

00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:48.408 line:95%,end
We're going to ask them about it.
And Melissa ran off and got married.

00:01:48.475 --> 00:01:50.009 line:95%,end
We didn't even get to bring our cameras.

00:01:50.076 --> 00:01:51.611 line:95%,end
So we're going
to find out the details from her.

00:01:51.678 --> 00:01:54.080 line:95%,end
Plus, your favorites and mine, the girls

00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:56.382 line:95%,end
are here to perform
Abby's favorite dances.

00:01:56.483 --> 00:01:58.418 line:95%,end
But right now,
let's start with a woman

00:01:58.485 --> 00:01:59.819 line:95%,end
who had a lot to say this season.

00:01:59.886 --> 00:02:01.020 line:95%,end
Take a look at this.

00:02:01.421 --> 00:02:03.256 line:95%,end
Chloe was awful today!

00:02:03.323 --> 00:02:04.757 line:95%,end
You pick on the children!

00:02:04.824 --> 00:02:06.493 line:95%,end
- 'Cause you're an idiot!
- Happy?

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:07.560 line:95%,end
Go to hell! Don't talk to--

00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:08.628 line:95%,end
- Thank you.
- --another woman like that.

00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:10.330 line:95%,end
Thank you.
I don't talk to my wife like that

00:02:10.396 --> 00:02:12.398 line:95%,end
because my wife wouldn't
talk to children like that.

00:02:12.465 --> 00:02:13.500 line:95%,end
Come on, big boy!

00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:15.034 line:95%,end
You were all mouth before!

00:02:15.101 --> 00:02:16.803 line:95%,end
It's time to not be dancing anymore.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.571 line:95%,end
I've had it. I'm finished.

00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:20.773 line:95%,end
Let's welcome Abby Lee Miller.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.277 line:95%,end
[upbeat music]

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:31.651 line:95%,end
OK.
You're here.

00:02:31.718 --> 00:02:33.086 line:95%,end
- You look fantastic.
- Thank you, sir.

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:34.220 line:95%,end
- You're holding up.
- Thank you.

00:02:34.287 --> 00:02:35.622 line:95%,end
How are you? How are you feeling?

00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:38.691 line:95%,end
I'm good.
I have some amazing opportunities

00:02:38.758 --> 00:02:40.827 line:95%,end
that have just come my way recently.

00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:42.228 line:95%,end
You just got a chance
to co-host "The View."

00:02:42.295 --> 00:02:43.796 line:95%,end
- I did.
- You held your own.

00:02:43.863 --> 00:02:45.798 line:95%,end
You didn't look like
you were nervous at all.

00:02:45.865 --> 00:02:48.268 line:95%,end
You looked like you just walked in
and were like, I'm here.

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:50.570 line:95%,end
I sell people dreams
every single day

00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:51.604 line:95%,end
- at my studio.
- JEFF: Well--

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:52.505 line:95%,end
I can handle it.

00:02:52.572 --> 00:02:54.474 line:95%,end
You have had a lot
to deal with this year.

00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:57.243 line:95%,end
- Yes.
- You had a dance dad yell at you.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.512 line:95%,end
No, I was verbally assaulted.

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:02.282 line:95%,end
- OK.
- Let's get it straight.

00:03:02.348 --> 00:03:05.084 line:95%,end
You had difficulties
with both Christi and with Cathy.

00:03:05.151 --> 00:03:06.286 line:95%,end
And something that I can certainly--

00:03:06.352 --> 00:03:07.921 line:95%,end
No, I did not have difficulties
with Cathy.

00:03:07.987 --> 00:03:10.323 line:95%,end
I was physically assaulted by Cathy.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.692 line:95%,end
Oh, my gosh.
We're definitely getting right to it.

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:15.094 line:95%,end
So look, I want to play the name game.
Do you know how the name game works?

00:03:15.995 --> 00:03:17.564 line:95%,end
Like Bo-banna?

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.066 line:95%,end
No, not like that.
I'm gonna say someone's name.

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:21.367 line:95%,end
- And-- and I want--
- Right.

00:03:21.434 --> 00:03:22.802 line:95%,end
--you to say the first thing
that pops into your head

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:24.137 line:95%,end
- when I say this person's name.
- OK.

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:25.872 line:95%,end
All right, so let's go. You ready?
Kelly.

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.974 line:95%,end
- Foolish.
- Christi.


00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:29.309 line:95%,end
Evil.

00:03:29.375 --> 00:03:30.443 line:95%,end
Melissa.

00:03:31.911 --> 00:03:33.913 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: Sly like a Fox.

00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:35.315 line:95%,end
OK.

00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:36.449 line:95%,end
Chloe's hat.

00:03:36.983 --> 00:03:37.984 line:95%,end
Death.

00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:40.920 line:95%,end
- Apple Core.
- Plagiarism.

00:03:40.987 --> 00:03:42.589 line:95%,end
Cathy's purse.

00:03:42.655 --> 00:03:47.860 line:5%,start
Heavy, sharp, hurtful, bludgeoning.

00:03:47.927 --> 00:03:49.562 line:5%,start
Look, we're on a sofa.
It's like a talk show.

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:52.098 line:5%,start
All right, give me one word
to describe Abby.

00:03:53.266 --> 00:03:54.467 line:95%,end
- Mean.
- Thank you.

00:03:54.534 --> 00:03:55.802 line:95%,end
- Aw. You stole mine.
- You.

00:03:55.868 --> 00:03:57.003 line:95%,end
- CHRISTI: All right.
- I have one.

00:03:57.103 --> 00:03:59.172 line:95%,end
- Vindictive.
- Vindictive.

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:00.340 line:95%,end
- Vindictive.
- All right.

00:04:00.406 --> 00:04:01.908 line:95%,end
So, Abby, let's talk
about Melissa for a second.

00:04:01.975 --> 00:04:04.877 line:95%,end
So Melissa had a season
where it seemed like a lot of the time,

00:04:04.944 --> 00:04:06.379 line:95%,end
she was siding with the moms.

00:04:06.446 --> 00:04:07.680 line:95%,end
So how did that make you feel,

00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:10.049 line:95%,end
when you felt like maybe a little bit
of her loyalty was in question?

00:04:10.116 --> 00:04:11.718 line:95%,end
Well, I think she's respectful to me.

00:04:11.784 --> 00:04:15.154 line:95%,end
And I think she knows
that I have Maddie and Mackenzie's

00:04:15.388 --> 00:04:16.623 line:95%,end
best interests at heart.

00:04:16.856 --> 00:04:18.691 line:95%,end
She knows that.
She's not stupid.

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:22.595 line:95%,end
However, I just think
she figured, you know what?

00:04:22.662 --> 00:04:25.698 line:95%,end
I'm going to go with it.
I'm going to be part of this "clique."

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:28.701 line:95%,end
I'm going to be with the moms,
and I'm going to fit in.

00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:30.970 line:95%,end
And if my kid doesn't win, it's OK,

00:04:31.037 --> 00:04:33.039 line:95%,end
'cause Maddie's still great,
and it'll be fine.

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:34.741 line:95%,end
- Well--
- And how did that make you feel?

00:04:35.174 --> 00:04:36.442 line:95%,end
Disappointed.

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:39.412 line:95%,end
Disappointed that
you would put your own relationships

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:41.547 line:95%,end
before your child's success.

00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:43.316 line:95%,end
Let's get her out here,
because I want to find out

00:04:43.383 --> 00:04:44.417 line:95%,end
about this wedding, too.

00:04:44.484 --> 00:04:45.485 line:95%,end
- [gasps]
- How about--

00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:46.552 line:95%,end
The wedding I wasn't invited to?

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:47.920 line:95%,end
Well, or me either.

00:04:47.987 --> 00:04:49.355 line:95%,end
Guys, please welcome Melissa.

00:04:49.422 --> 00:04:52.225 line:95%,end
[cheering]

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:54.761 line:95%,end
[upbeat music]

00:04:57.597 --> 00:04:58.598 line:95%,end
Have a seat.

00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:01.534 line:95%,end
- How are you?
- Great.

00:05:01.601 --> 00:05:03.603 line:95%,end
- Thank you. How are you.
- It's really good to see you.

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.072 line:95%,end
- Thank you.
- So the thing that's on everyone's mind

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:07.740 line:95%,end
is we want to hear about the wedding.

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:09.175 line:95%,end
Let the audience see the ring.
Show the ring.

00:05:09.242 --> 00:05:10.243 line:95%,end
It was beautiful. It was actually--

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.511 line:95%,end
- JEFF: Wow.
- --really sweet. Greg cried.

00:05:11.778 --> 00:05:12.845 line:95%,end
Can you guys see the rock?

00:05:12.912 --> 00:05:14.113 line:95%,end
[audience ooh-ing]

00:05:14.647 --> 00:05:15.948 line:95%,end
Why was the wedding such a secret?

00:05:16.015 --> 00:05:19.018 line:95%,end
It wasn't a secret.
Every mom knew before the day came.

00:05:19.085 --> 00:05:22.121 line:95%,end
Greg did not want to do it
on national TV, unfortunately.

00:05:22.188 --> 00:05:25.358 line:95%,end
I tried my best to get it on TV,

00:05:25.425 --> 00:05:27.760 line:95%,end
- and he would not do it.
- But you're marrying this man. You--

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:29.362 line:95%,end
- MELISSA: Yeah, but--
- What you say goes.

00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:31.331 line:95%,end
- [laughs]
- But his-- It does go.

00:05:31.397 --> 00:05:32.732 line:95%,end
Because, can I tell you,
he does everything

00:05:32.799 --> 00:05:34.300 line:95%,end
that I ask him to do and more.

00:05:34.367 --> 00:05:37.203 line:95%,end
- Well, not on national television.
- [laughter]

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.206 line:95%,end
All right.
So who has a question for Melissa?

00:05:40.273 --> 00:05:42.208 line:95%,end
- Hi, Melissa. I am also a dance mom.
- Hi.

00:05:42.408 --> 00:05:44.544 line:95%,end
I wanted to ask you, you had mentioned

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.780 line:95%,end
that you had found the perfect dress
to the other moms.

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:11.604 line:95%,end
It was really tough.
It was very strained.

00:06:11.671 --> 00:06:15.942 line:95%,end

and always will.

00:06:17.176 --> 00:06:18.845 line:95%,end
All right, so who else has a question?
One more.

00:06:18.945 --> 00:06:23.149 line:95%,end
Now that Maddie is back on top,
how do the other moms feel about you now?

00:06:24.851 --> 00:06:27.019 line:95%,end
Nobody gives a [bleep]

00:06:27.086 --> 00:06:28.121 line:95%,end
JILL: Maddie was never not--

00:06:28.187 --> 00:06:29.188 line:95%,end
- Exactly.
- JILL: --on top.

00:06:29.255 --> 00:06:30.490 line:95%,end
Are you kidding me?

00:06:30.556 --> 00:06:31.791 line:95%,end
That was never an issue. That was, like--

00:06:31.858 --> 00:06:32.859 line:95%,end
- KELLY: No.
- --never a real--

00:06:32.925 --> 00:06:34.727 line:95%,end
- she was never really on the bottom--
- JILL: No. She was never, never--

00:06:34.794 --> 00:06:35.795 line:95%,end
- --on the outs.
- --not on top.

00:06:35.862 --> 00:06:36.896 line:95%,end
- KELLY: (LAUGHING) Exactly.
- Like, really?

00:06:36.963 --> 00:06:40.333 line:95%,end
You know, Maddie is Abby's favorite,
and it's clear.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.601 line:95%,end
I mean, she shows it.

00:06:41.667 --> 00:06:42.969 line:95%,end
It's not about a favorite.

00:06:43.035 --> 00:06:47.039 line:95%,end
It's about on time,
prepared, hair is up in a bun,

00:06:47.106 --> 00:06:50.476 line:95%,end

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.713 line:95%,end

to be the favorite.

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:55.982 line:95%,end

00:06:56.048 --> 00:06:57.383 line:95%,end
So Abby, let's switch gears for a second

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:58.684 line:95%,end
and talk about Holly.

00:06:58.751 --> 00:07:01.354 line:95%,end
Holly, I believe,
called you a monstrosity of evil.

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:03.089 line:95%,end
- Was that her choice of words?
- Yes.

00:07:03.156 --> 00:07:04.190 line:95%,end
I respect Holly.

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:05.925 line:95%,end
I think she was wrong in saying that.

00:07:05.992 --> 00:07:06.993 line:95%,end
It was a rough day.

00:07:07.059 --> 00:07:08.428 line:95%,end
It was a rough weekend.

00:07:08.494 --> 00:07:09.862 line:95%,end
Where are you with Holly right now?

00:07:10.663 --> 00:07:11.764 line:95%,end
I'm OK with Holly.

00:07:11.831 --> 00:07:13.499 line:95%,end
You're always critical
about what Holly wears.

00:07:13.566 --> 00:07:14.600 line:95%,end
What is it about Holly's clothes--

00:07:14.667 --> 00:07:16.669 line:95%,end
Well, I costume dancers.

00:07:16.736 --> 00:07:20.907 line:95%,end
And I think you should costume
to show off your assets

00:07:20.973 --> 00:07:22.108 line:95%,end
and hide your flaws.

00:07:22.175 --> 00:07:23.810 line:95%,end
- OK.
- She doesn't do that.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.012 line:95%,end
Show off your decollete.

00:07:26.078 --> 00:07:28.581 line:95%,end
Show off your beautiful broad shoulders.

00:07:28.648 --> 00:07:31.417 line:95%,end

Don't show off the cankles.

Hi.

00:07:45.665 --> 00:07:46.766 line:95%,end
Look at that tiny waist.

00:07:46.833 --> 00:07:48.568 line:95%,end

00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:52.338 line:95%,end

- HOLLY: Thank you.

00:07:52.405 --> 00:07:53.840 line:95%,end
So did you take Abby's advice?

00:07:53.906 --> 00:07:57.410 line:95%,end
As much as I wanted to resist Abby
and her passion tidbits

00:07:57.477 --> 00:08:00.213 line:95%,end
and advice,
there were good constructive criticism

00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:01.447 line:95%,end
I was able to apply.

00:08:01.514 --> 00:08:03.316 line:95%,end
And I do think of some things
that she says

00:08:03.382 --> 00:08:05.051 line:95%,end
when I'm outfitting myself.

00:08:05.117 --> 00:08:09.622 line:95%,end
So, Holly, on this season,
you had some very strong words

00:08:09.689 --> 00:08:11.891 line:95%,end
that you used, which is a
little uncharacteristic for you.

00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.126 line:95%,end
You called Abby a monstrosity of evil.

00:08:14.193 --> 00:08:16.095 line:95%,end
But at least it was a good tagline.

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:17.763 line:95%,end
[laughs]

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:20.466 line:95%,end

00:08:20.533 --> 00:08:23.669 line:95%,end

- This was at a competition.

00:08:23.736 --> 00:08:24.904 line:95%,end
We were in Detroit.

00:08:24.971 --> 00:08:28.341 line:95%,end
Nia was battling
some issues related to pain.

00:08:28.407 --> 00:08:32.311 line:95%,end
And Abby did not understand
Nia's condition.

00:08:32.378 --> 00:08:34.313 line:95%,end
And what I took from her comments

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:36.649 line:95%,end
was that she was belittling it,
or she di-- because she didn't

00:08:36.716 --> 00:08:39.085 line:95%,end
understand it,
she wasn't taking it seriously.

00:08:39.252 --> 00:08:40.887 line:95%,end
- And that's--
- JEFF: Were you being insensitive?

00:08:40.953 --> 00:08:42.088 line:95%,end
That was it.

00:08:42.154 --> 00:08:43.322 line:95%,end
My point is I have to deal with the kids.

00:08:43.389 --> 00:08:45.525 line:95%,end
I know when a kid is in pain.

00:08:45.591 --> 00:08:48.160 line:95%,end
I can hear a bone break three rooms away.

00:08:48.227 --> 00:08:51.330 line:95%,end
- Mm-hmm.
- So I was just like, you know what?

00:08:51.397 --> 00:08:52.999 line:95%,end
Either she's dancing or she's not.

00:08:53.065 --> 00:08:55.134 line:95%,end
And if you're in pain,
but it's not real pain,

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:57.837 line:95%,end
and you're not going
to get further injured from it,

00:08:57.904 --> 00:08:59.672 line:95%,end
then don't tell me you're in pain.

00:08:59.739 --> 00:09:00.873 line:95%,end
Just deal with it.

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:02.308 line:95%,end

what the audience has to ask you.

Who's got a question?

Hi, Holly.

00:09:05.311 --> 00:09:08.281 line:95%,end
You had said that Nia's pain disorder
is caused by stress.

00:09:08.347 --> 00:09:10.716 line:95%,end
- HOLLY: Mm-hmm.
- So do you really think

00:09:10.783 --> 00:09:13.185 line:95%,end
that it's the best environment
for her to be dancing as a hobby?

00:09:13.252 --> 00:09:15.555 line:95%,end
You know, it's--
that's an excellent question.

00:09:15.621 --> 00:09:17.323 line:95%,end
And I think throughout the season,
that's the question

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:18.791 line:95%,end
I get the most from people.

00:09:18.858 --> 00:09:20.860 line:95%,end
She's going to have to learn
how to deal with stress in life.

00:09:20.927 --> 00:09:23.729 line:95%,end
And if I take away dance,
I'm taking away a part of who she is,

00:09:23.863 --> 00:09:25.197 line:95%,end
- and that's a punishment.
- Amen, sister.

00:09:25.264 --> 00:09:26.399 line:95%,end
I don't want her to-- to punish her.

00:09:26.465 --> 00:09:27.466 line:95%,end
I don't want to--

00:09:27.533 --> 00:09:28.534 line:95%,end
- JEFF: I think that's great.
- --punish Nia.

00:09:28.601 --> 00:09:29.635 line:95%,end
No, I think that's--
I think that's really smart.

00:09:29.702 --> 00:09:32.038 line:95%,end
And I don't want her to be defined
by this. She is a survivor.

00:09:32.104 --> 00:09:34.240 line:95%,end
And I want her to know that
you're not limited by this.

00:09:34.307 --> 00:09:35.374 line:95%,end

- MELISSA: She's a tough cookie.

Hello.

00:09:38.678 --> 00:09:40.546 line:95%,end
So you always ask Nia how her pain

00:09:40.613 --> 00:09:42.315 line:95%,end
is on a scale of one to ten.

00:09:42.815 --> 00:09:45.751 line:95%,end

how much pain does Abby cause you?

to zero to sixty in a heartbeat.

what she was saying.

I don't Abby really got
what I was talking about.

00:12:27.646 --> 00:12:31.183 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:36.522 line:95%,end
Brooke, that was absolutely amazing.

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:38.891 line:95%,end
So Abby, we have a lot of people
here who are fans,

00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.726 line:95%,end
and they have questions for you.
So you ready?

00:12:40.793 --> 00:12:42.161 line:95%,end
- Certainly.
- All right.

00:12:42.228 --> 00:12:43.195 line:95%,end
Let's take some questions
from the audience for Abby.

00:12:43.262 --> 00:12:44.697 line:95%,end
Hi, Abby.

00:12:44.764 --> 00:12:47.366 line:95%,end
I'm a dance dad, and I have
two daughters who love everything

00:12:47.433 --> 00:12:48.701 line:95%,end
about your show.

00:12:48.768 --> 00:12:52.271 line:95%,end
During this season,
you said that Kelly isn't very bright.

00:12:52.338 --> 00:12:53.739 line:95%,end
Do you really feel this way?

00:12:53.806 --> 00:12:55.474 line:95%,end
Yes, absolutely.

00:12:55.741 --> 00:12:59.245 line:95%,end
I feel that Kelly is a beautiful girl

00:12:59.311 --> 00:13:01.580 line:95%,end
and had an amazing future ahead of her

00:13:01.647 --> 00:13:03.349 line:5%,start
and kind of threw it away.

00:13:03.415 --> 00:13:05.584 line:5%,start
Is this beat-up-Kelly day?

00:13:05.651 --> 00:13:09.522 line:95%,end
Kelly wants to have fun.
And that's her MO--

00:13:09.588 --> 00:13:10.856 line:95%,end
fun, fun, fun, fun, fun.

00:13:10.923 --> 00:13:13.192 line:95%,end
And she's raising her kids
that it's just all about fun.

00:13:13.259 --> 00:13:14.527 line:95%,end
Things are different now.

00:13:14.593 --> 00:13:17.596 line:95%,end
Life is way more competitive
than when she was a kid.

00:13:17.663 --> 00:13:20.099 line:95%,end
So your kid can't always be having fun.

00:13:20.166 --> 00:13:23.235 line:95%,end
Sometimes they have
to buckle down and do the work.

00:13:24.436 --> 00:13:25.404 line:95%,end
Wish me luck, ladies.

00:13:25.471 --> 00:13:26.972 line:95%,end
- Go get them, Kel.
- Good luck.

00:13:27.039 --> 00:13:28.808 line:95%,end
All right.
She's known Abby the longest.

00:13:28.874 --> 00:13:30.376 line:95%,end
Please say hello to Kelly.

00:13:30.442 --> 00:13:32.178 line:95%,end
[upbeat music]

00:13:32.244 --> 00:13:33.846 line:95%,end
[cheering]

00:13:33.979 --> 00:13:34.847 line:95%,end
Hi, Kelly.

00:13:34.914 --> 00:13:36.448 line:95%,end
- Hello.
- JEFF: Good to see you.

00:13:36.515 --> 00:13:38.284 line:95%,end
- Thank you.
- You look fabulous--

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:39.952 line:95%,end
- tan and everything.
- Yes.

00:13:40.019 --> 00:13:41.620 line:95%,end
That happens in LA.

00:13:41.687 --> 00:13:42.788 line:95%,end
[laughs]

00:13:42.855 --> 00:13:44.290 line:95%,end
So listen, at the beginning of the season,

00:13:44.356 --> 00:13:46.725 line:95%,end
when you decided to go back
to the Abby Lee Dance Company,

00:13:46.792 --> 00:13:49.161 line:95%,end
you felt that Paige and Brooke
had a hard time getting back


00:13:49.228 --> 00:13:50.429 line:95%,end
into Abby's good graces.

00:13:50.496 --> 00:13:52.498 line:95%,end
So was that hard to watch?

00:13:52.565 --> 00:13:53.966 line:95%,end
Absolutely.

00:13:54.033 --> 00:13:57.937 line:95%,end
But, you know, I mean,
I think every mom wants their kids

00:13:58.003 --> 00:14:01.307 line:95%,end
to be a favorite
or wants them to be treated well.

00:14:01.373 --> 00:14:05.945 line:95%,end
And my goal for this season
was to bring my kids back,

00:14:06.011 --> 00:14:07.847 line:95%,end
because that's what they ask me to do.

00:14:07.913 --> 00:14:09.148 line:95%,end
So I brought them back.

00:14:09.215 --> 00:14:11.984 line:95%,end
But it's really been difficult for me,

00:14:12.051 --> 00:14:14.486 line:95%,end
because I don't agree
with a lot of the things

00:14:14.553 --> 00:14:16.155 line:95%,end
that Abby says or does.

00:14:16.222 --> 00:14:17.857 line:95%,end
And I have been trying
to keep myself quiet.

00:14:17.923 --> 00:14:19.959 line:95%,end
But for some reason,
my kids are always still

00:14:20.025 --> 00:14:22.294 line:95%,end
- at the bottom of that pyramid.
- Well, but she-- you know what?

00:14:22.361 --> 00:14:23.829 line:95%,end
Paige is doing better.

00:14:23.896 --> 00:14:25.464 line:95%,end
So Kelly, listen, the audience is here.

00:14:25.531 --> 00:14:28.067 line:95%,end
You know how this works.
So who has the first question for Kelly?

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.835 line:95%,end
- Hi, Kelly.
- Hi.

00:14:29.902 --> 00:14:32.004 line:95%,end
We've never seen you
and Christi fight like that.

00:14:32.071 --> 00:14:34.440 line:95%,end
And Christi said that you never called

00:14:34.506 --> 00:14:36.141 line:95%,end
while she was on suspension.

00:14:36.208 --> 00:14:37.243 line:95%,end
How do you feel about that?

00:14:37.576 --> 00:14:39.378 line:95%,end
I see Christi and the other moms

00:14:39.445 --> 00:14:40.779 line:95%,end
more than I see my husband.

00:14:41.213 --> 00:14:43.048 line:95%,end
So obviously, we're going to fight.

00:14:43.115 --> 00:14:46.552 line:95%,end
I don't know why Christi
said I didn't call her.

00:14:46.619 --> 00:14:47.987 line:95%,end
Three times, I called Christi.

00:14:48.053 --> 00:14:49.321 line:95%,end
She did not call me three times.

00:14:49.388 --> 00:14:50.890 line:95%,end
HOLLY: She did. She called you--
She did. I was there.

00:14:50.956 --> 00:14:51.857 line:95%,end
--upstairs on the bus.

00:14:51.924 --> 00:14:53.592 line:95%,end
- She called you more than once.
- Mm-hmm

00:14:53.659 --> 00:14:56.328 line:95%,end
I know in my heart
that I called her, and I did.

00:14:56.395 --> 00:14:57.529 line:95%,end
But who cares? That's like seventh grade.

00:14:57.596 --> 00:14:59.265 line:95%,end
- I did, you know?
- Who cares?

00:14:59.331 --> 00:15:01.333 line:95%,end
And she kept making comments, well,

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.568 line:95%,end
if I didn't answer the phone, then

00:15:02.635 --> 00:15:04.236 line:95%,end
you should have came to my house.

00:15:04.303 --> 00:15:05.304 line:95%,end
And I agree with that.

00:15:05.371 --> 00:15:07.306 line:95%,end
I'm not in high school anymore.

00:15:07.373 --> 00:15:08.641 line:95%,end
I'm not going to drive to your house

00:15:08.707 --> 00:15:10.075 line:95%,end
if you're not gonna answer my phone call.

00:15:10.142 --> 00:15:12.912 line:95%,end
If you don't wanna talk to me,
then don't talk to me.

00:15:13.245 --> 00:15:14.680 line:95%,end
But you guys really went at it.

00:15:15.447 --> 00:15:17.549 line:95%,end
So let's bring Christi out
and see what she has to say.

00:15:17.616 --> 00:15:18.817 line:95%,end
Please welcome Christi.

00:15:18.884 --> 00:15:20.819 line:95%,end
[upbeat music]

00:15:20.886 --> 00:15:23.155 line:95%,end
[cheering]

00:15:24.256 --> 00:15:25.257 line:95%,end
Hi, Christi.

00:15:25.324 --> 00:15:26.158 line:95%,end
- Hi, Jeff.
- JEFF: Welcome.

00:15:26.225 --> 00:15:27.226 line:95%,end
- Have a seat.
- Hello.

00:15:27.293 --> 00:15:28.394 line:95%,end
- Thank you.
- You look fantastic.

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:29.762 line:95%,end
Oh, thank you.

00:15:29.828 --> 00:15:32.498 line:95%,end
Let's get right to it.
You said that Kelly never called you.

00:15:32.564 --> 00:15:35.267 line:95%,end
Kelly and I talk probably
three and four times a day,

00:15:35.334 --> 00:15:37.503 line:95%,end
and she didn't call for a few days.

00:15:37.569 --> 00:15:40.406 line:95%,end
And there was a lot going on
with Chloe's hat,

00:15:40.472 --> 00:15:42.241 line:95%,end
and there was a lot of emotions
running high.

00:15:42.308 --> 00:15:44.743 line:95%,end
And when Kelly had gone through
those things with her girls,

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:46.378 line:95%,end
I was always her biggest cheerleader.

00:15:46.445 --> 00:15:48.247 line:95%,end
And when am I never there for Chloe?

00:15:48.314 --> 00:15:49.415 line:95%,end
No, I didn't say that.

00:15:49.481 --> 00:15:50.916 line:95%,end
I said that you didn't call me
for a few days,

00:15:50.983 --> 00:15:53.118 line:95%,end
- and that's very honest.
- Christi, you know what?

00:15:53.185 --> 00:15:54.353 line:95%,end
You don't want to go there.

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:56.555 line:95%,end
- But, Kelly, it's the truth.
- You don't want to go there.

00:15:56.622 --> 00:15:58.257 line:95%,end
- It's the truth.
- No, it is not the truth.

00:15:58.324 --> 00:16:00.192 line:95%,end
- Well--
- Why would you say that

00:16:00.259 --> 00:16:02.761 line:95%,end
you're my kid's biggest advocate
and I wasn't?

00:16:02.828 --> 00:16:06.398 line:95%,end
Because any time-- and you can ask
Abby, who can't stand either one of us,

00:16:06.465 --> 00:16:08.067 line:95%,end
who was sticking up for your kid.

00:16:08.133 --> 00:16:11.370 line:95%,end
No. I knew that Abby was gonna come in
and take things out on Chloe.

00:16:11.437 --> 00:16:13.372 line:95%,end
Abby's emotions
were running high that day

00:16:13.439 --> 00:16:14.606 line:95%,end
because Cathy was there.

00:16:14.673 --> 00:16:16.141 line:95%,end
- And she--
- And so were yours.

00:16:16.608 --> 00:16:17.810 line:95%,end
OK?

00:16:17.876 --> 00:16:19.211 line:95%,end
And that's why
when I said something about--

00:16:19.278 --> 00:16:20.646 line:95%,end
- CHRISTI: Kelly--
- --about the hat being dropped--

00:16:20.713 --> 00:16:21.914 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Oh, my God.
KELLY: --you flipped on me.

00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:23.515 line:95%,end
- I did not. I just said--
- KELLY: Yes, you did!

00:16:23.582 --> 00:16:24.717 line:95%,end
--stop bringing it up.

00:16:24.783 --> 00:16:27.286 line:95%,end
You don't think
that Abby noticed that that hat fell?

00:16:27.353 --> 00:16:28.921 line:95%,end
No. But I know
that I protect you and your kid.

00:16:28.988 --> 00:16:29.989 line:95%,end
The whole entire audience did.

00:16:30.055 --> 00:16:31.457 line:95%,end
That wasn't the problem, Kelly.

00:16:31.523 --> 00:16:32.791 line:95%,end
- And you know what-- No, it wasn't.
- KELLY: Oh, yes, it was.

00:16:32.858 --> 00:16:33.826 line:95%,end
Yes, it was.

00:16:34.693 --> 00:16:35.761 line:95%,end
Well, I think part of the problem

00:16:35.828 --> 00:16:38.564 line:95%,end
was the whole turn section
at the beginning

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:39.932 line:95%,end
was screwed up by Chloe.

00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:42.001 line:95%,end
- And let's talk about--
- KELLY: [inaudible]

00:16:42.067 --> 00:16:42.968 line:95%,end
--our Kendall beating Chloe, too.

00:16:43.035 --> 00:16:44.970 line:95%,end
Chloe gets beat all the time.
You make sure of that.

00:16:45.037 --> 00:16:45.871 line:95%,end
I'm used to that.

00:16:45.938 --> 00:16:47.339 line:95%,end
It had nothing to do with it.

00:16:47.406 --> 00:16:48.507 line:95%,end
Not by Kendall.

00:16:48.574 --> 00:16:49.775 line:95%,end
Why are you so smug about it, Abby?

00:16:49.842 --> 00:16:50.809 line:95%,end
- Do you really want to see your--
- I'm not.

00:16:50.876 --> 00:16:52.778 line:95%,end
Because that's why you were angry.
That's why you were agitated.

00:16:52.845 --> 00:16:53.746 line:95%,end
That's not why I was angry.

00:16:53.812 --> 00:16:54.813 line:95%,end
I don't feel that I was wrong.

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:55.914 line:95%,end
I wanted to leave.

00:16:55.981 --> 00:16:57.750 line:95%,end
'Cause, frankly, I was sick
of Chloe being treated the way

00:16:57.816 --> 00:16:58.851 line:95%,end
that Abby treats her.

00:16:58.917 --> 00:17:01.053 line:95%,end
Because she came back
with a vengeance this year

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.121 line:95%,end
because she hates me.

00:17:02.187 --> 00:17:03.055 line:95%,end
OK, I'm finished.

00:17:03.122 --> 00:17:04.289 line:95%,end
No, no, no. She's not--

00:17:04.356 --> 00:17:06.258 line:95%,end
- Yeah, yep, yep, yep.
- No, no, no. She--

[gasping]

00:17:08.227 --> 00:17:10.162 line:95%,end

Yo, blondie!

00:17:15.634 --> 00:17:18.370 line:95%,end
How belittling can you get
to not even say someone's name?

00:17:18.437 --> 00:17:20.639 line:95%,end
- MOM 1: Where's Jill?
- MOM 2: Having a private with Kendall.

00:17:20.739 --> 00:17:21.907 line:95%,end
Hey.

00:17:21.974 --> 00:17:24.143 line:95%,end
Guess you didn't expect
to see me out here, huh?

00:17:24.209 --> 00:17:25.177 line:95%,end
How about Kendall?

00:17:25.244 --> 00:17:26.178 line:95%,end
She couldn't even place.

00:17:26.245 --> 00:17:29.515 line:95%,end
- This needs to stop.
- Don't say anything about my child.

00:17:29.581 --> 00:17:32.251 line:95%,end
- Bring it on, bitch.
- Get away from me.

00:17:32.317 --> 00:17:34.820 line:95%,end
She came back with a vengeance
because she hates me.

00:17:34.887 --> 00:17:36.822 line:95%,end
- OK, I'm finished.
- No, no, no. She's--

00:17:36.889 --> 00:17:38.857 line:95%,end
- Yeah, yep, yep, yep.
- No, no, no. No, no, no. She--

So, Christi, why do you feel as though--

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:46.665 line:95%,end
- Because it's obvious.
- --as though Abby's tough on Chloe?

00:17:46.732 --> 00:17:48.167 line:95%,end
- I mean--
- No, it's not tough on her.

between being tough and being cruel.

It's not a big issue.

Who says to a person, blondie, girl, you?

00:17:59.711 --> 00:18:02.548 line:95%,end
I mean, that's very demeaning to a child.

00:18:02.614 --> 00:18:04.349 line:95%,end
You don't want me to say stupid anymore?

00:18:04.416 --> 00:18:06.752 line:95%,end
I looked up dim, dim-witted, half-wit.

00:18:06.819 --> 00:18:08.420 line:95%,end
I got lots of words.

00:18:08.754 --> 00:18:11.356 line:95%,end
My students learn from their mistakes.

00:18:11.423 --> 00:18:12.658 line:95%,end
She has not learned anything.

00:18:12.724 --> 00:18:13.959 line:95%,end
So Kelly, would you--

00:18:14.026 --> 00:18:15.727 line:95%,end
I mean, knowing Christi
as well as you know her,

00:18:15.794 --> 00:18:19.465 line:95%,end
when you could see
that she was really upset,

00:18:19.698 --> 00:18:22.568 line:95%,end
more than she's ever been upset before,
like, wh--

00:18:22.634 --> 00:18:24.269 line:95%,end
The whole fight started becau--

00:18:24.336 --> 00:18:26.371 line:95%,end
I mean, her whole leaving started

00:18:26.438 --> 00:18:28.006 line:95%,end
- because I said something about--
- No, it wasn't.

00:18:28.073 --> 00:18:29.274 line:95%,end
- --Chloe dropping her hat.
- No, Kelly.

00:18:29.341 --> 00:18:30.342 line:95%,end
That wasn't it.

00:18:30.409 --> 00:18:32.811 line:95%,end
You said that, and I snapped at you,
but that wasn't the reason.

00:18:32.878 --> 00:18:34.746 line:95%,end
The reason was Abby
was gonna come in there and attack Chloe.

00:18:34.813 --> 00:18:36.248 line:95%,end
Abby comes in and attacks my kids

00:18:36.315 --> 00:18:37.716 line:95%,end
- every time they do a dance.
- Yeah.

00:18:37.783 --> 00:18:38.617 line:95%,end
And so then you should understand

00:18:38.684 --> 00:18:40.686 line:95%,end
- where I was coming from.
- Exactly. I did understand.

00:18:40.752 --> 00:18:41.753 line:95%,end
That's why I called you.

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:44.756 line:95%,end
You can sit here and lie,
but we talk every day.

00:18:44.823 --> 00:18:45.924 line:95%,end
And you waited for days.

00:18:45.991 --> 00:18:47.926 line:95%,end
Well, clear-- clearly, the two of you,

00:18:47.993 --> 00:18:49.561 line:95%,end
you haven't completely
patched this up yet.

00:18:49.628 --> 00:18:51.230 line:95%,end
I'm actually a little surprised
that it came out

00:18:51.296 --> 00:18:53.732 line:95%,end
and it was such a big thing,
because I feel like we've moved past it.

00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:55.267 line:95%,end
- But maybe Kelly hasn't.
- All right.

00:18:55.334 --> 00:18:56.401 line:95%,end
You want to take a question
from the audience?

00:18:56.468 --> 00:18:57.469 line:95%,end
- CHRISTI: Sure.
- All right.

00:18:57.536 --> 00:18:58.770 line:95%,end
So who's got a question for Christi?

00:18:58.837 --> 00:18:59.738 line:95%,end
Yeah.

00:18:59.805 --> 00:19:01.206 line:95%,end
- Hi, Christi.
- Hi.

00:19:01.273 --> 00:19:04.109 line:95%,end
I was wondering
whether you thought it was possible

00:19:04.176 --> 00:19:07.179 line:95%,end
for Chloe to have the type
of relationship with Abby

00:19:07.579 --> 00:19:09.114 line:95%,end
that Abby has with Maddie.

00:19:09.181 --> 00:19:11.350 line:95%,end
Oh, never.
Abby will never treat Chloe like that.

00:19:11.416 --> 00:19:14.086 line:95%,end
She likes Maddie, she doesn't like Chloe,
bottom of the line.

00:19:14.153 --> 00:19:15.821 line:95%,end
But do you really think
that has to do with Chloe?

00:19:15.888 --> 00:19:17.489 line:95%,end
Or does it have more to do
with your relationship?

00:19:17.556 --> 00:19:19.658 line:95%,end
She doesn't like me,
and she doesn't care for my daughter.

00:19:19.725 --> 00:19:21.326 line:95%,end
If I liked somebody,
I wouldn't be calling them

00:19:21.393 --> 00:19:22.828 line:95%,end
a sneak, a snake, a liar.

00:19:22.895 --> 00:19:24.563 line:95%,end
She clearly doesn't like Chloe,

00:19:24.663 --> 00:19:27.966 line:95%,end
and I don't think there's anything
that Chloe or I can do

00:19:28.033 --> 00:19:32.004 line:95%,end
that will ever ensure that Abby
will have a good relationship with her.

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:33.238 line:95%,end
JEFF: You got so mad and punched a camera.

00:19:33.305 --> 00:19:35.407 line:95%,end
I didn't punch a camera.
I pushed the camera away from me.

00:19:35.474 --> 00:19:36.942 line:95%,end
- JEFF: So you pushed a camera?
- Yes.

00:19:37.042 --> 00:19:37.876 line:95%,end
Do you feel like you overreacted now,

00:19:37.943 --> 00:19:39.077 line:95%,end
- looking back on that?
- Certainly.

00:19:39.144 --> 00:19:42.648 line:95%,end
I-- I don't normally push cameramen
in my day-to-day life.

00:19:42.781 --> 00:19:44.650 line:95%,end
But, you know,
your natural instinct as a mother

00:19:44.716 --> 00:19:46.018 line:95%,end
is to protect your child.

00:19:46.084 --> 00:19:48.487 line:95%,end
And at that point,
I just wanted to be left alone.

00:19:48.554 --> 00:19:49.688 line:95%,end
I wanted to get in the cab.

00:19:49.755 --> 00:19:52.457 line:95%,end
I wanted to go home,
back to my normal life,

00:19:52.524 --> 00:19:53.859 line:95%,end
and remove myself from this.

00:19:53.926 --> 00:19:57.462 line:95%,end
And I came back this season
trying not to fight with Abby

00:19:57.529 --> 00:19:59.331 line:95%,end
so she would treat my kids better,

00:19:59.398 --> 00:20:00.832 line:95%,end
and she still doesn't treat them better.

00:20:00.899 --> 00:20:01.867 line:95%,end
Why do you think that is?

00:20:01.967 --> 00:20:03.502 line:95%,end
Do you think
it's because she has an issue

00:20:03.569 --> 00:20:05.304 line:95%,end
with the way you parent your kids--

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:06.772 line:95%,end
- Yes.
- JEFF: --as it pertains to dance?

00:20:06.838 --> 00:20:07.873 line:95%,end
Yes, I do.

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:09.041 line:95%,end
She just doesn't flat-out like me.

00:20:09.107 --> 00:20:10.642 line:95%,end
She feels that I am a threat to her

00:20:10.709 --> 00:20:14.012 line:95%,end
because I don't back down
and bow down to her like Melissa does.

00:20:14.279 --> 00:20:15.647 line:95%,end
Um, Abby is a dance teacher.

00:20:15.714 --> 00:20:16.949 line:95%,end
She provides a service.

00:20:17.015 --> 00:20:19.218 line:95%,end
And she does that service,
but she has no right

00:20:19.284 --> 00:20:21.453 line:95%,end
to dictate the rest of our lives.

00:20:21.753 --> 00:20:23.989 line:95%,end
Let's switch gears for a second
and talk about Jill.

00:20:24.056 --> 00:20:27.059 line:95%,end
How have you guys seen Jill,
like, change in the time

00:20:27.125 --> 00:20:27.960 line:95%,end
that you've known her?

00:20:28.026 --> 00:20:29.828 line:95%,end
She got rid of her 900 voice.

00:20:29.895 --> 00:20:33.065 line:95%,end
And the poof, the poof is gone.
She got rid of the poof.

00:20:33.131 --> 00:20:34.666 line:95%,end
Uh, you know what?
I like Jill.

00:20:34.733 --> 00:20:36.802 line:95%,end
I know sometimes
Jill can be a little shrill,

00:20:37.169 --> 00:20:38.070 line:95%,end
but I think she's funny. I me--

00:20:38.136 --> 00:20:40.372 line:95%,end
Oh, you just like Jill because you like
to make fun of her outfits.

00:20:40.439 --> 00:20:42.674 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Oh, my God.
Jill gives me banter for days.

00:20:42.741 --> 00:20:43.842 line:95%,end
- She showed up one time--
- KELLY: She has a get-up.

00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:45.510 line:95%,end
- She comes in.
- --dressed like Puss in Boots, OK?

00:20:45.644 --> 00:20:47.246 line:95%,end
- Yeah.
- Let's see what she's dressed like today.

00:20:47.379 --> 00:20:48.814 line:95%,end
Please welcome Jill.
Jill?

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.350 line:95%,end
- [upbeat music]
- [cheering]

00:20:51.416 --> 00:20:52.851 line:95%,end
This is all I got today.

00:20:52.918 --> 00:20:54.253 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Good.

00:20:54.886 --> 00:20:57.489 line:95%,end
No cowboy hat, no Muppets.

00:20:58.223 --> 00:20:59.191 line:95%,end
She's showing a little leg, though.

00:20:59.258 --> 00:21:00.659 line:95%,end
Jill's got a good set of legs
that she likes to show.

00:21:00.726 --> 00:21:03.262 line:95%,end
- OK. OK, boobs and boobs.
- I was being nice.

00:21:03.328 --> 00:21:05.063 line:95%,end
I said you have good legs.

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:08.433 line:95%,end
So, Jill, this season,
fans saw you scream.

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:10.068 line:95%,end
They saw you storm out.


00:21:10.135 --> 00:21:12.037 line:95%,end
They saw you throw water on Cathy.

00:21:12.471 --> 00:21:14.573 line:95%,end
Looking back on all those moments,

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.842 line:95%,end
what was the thing
that made you the angriest?

00:21:16.908 --> 00:21:20.279 line:95%,end
I think Cathy really made me angry.

00:21:20.345 --> 00:21:22.848 line:95%,end
And the funny thing
is she continues to make me angry.

00:21:22.914 --> 00:21:24.116 line:95%,end
More angry than Abby when--

00:21:24.316 --> 00:21:25.917 line:95%,end
- She does.
- --she gets on Kendall?

00:21:25.984 --> 00:21:28.253 line:95%,end
Because I pay Abby to critique my child.

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.188 line:95%,end
Cathy gets under your skin, big time.

00:21:30.255 --> 00:21:31.590 line:95%,end
- Cathy gets under my skin.
- JEFF: She does.

00:21:31.657 --> 00:21:35.661 line:95%,end
I don't think she has the right
to say the things that she says.

00:21:35.727 --> 00:21:37.195 line:95%,end
Well, she clearly knows
how to push your buttons,

00:21:37.262 --> 00:21:38.430 line:95%,end
without a doubt. All right.

00:21:38.497 --> 00:21:39.598 line:95%,end
So Jill, do you want
to take some questions

00:21:39.665 --> 00:21:40.766 line:95%,end
- from the audience?
- JILL: I will, yeah.

00:21:40.832 --> 00:21:41.767 line:95%,end
Because they have a ton of questions.

00:21:41.833 --> 00:21:42.768 line:95%,end
- JILL: Yeah.
- Who's got a question for Jill?

00:21:42.834 --> 00:21:45.637 line:95%,end
Hi, Jill. You hired
your own costume designer for Kendall

00:21:45.704 --> 00:21:48.440 line:95%,end
this season, and you got new head shots.

00:21:48.507 --> 00:21:50.909 line:95%,end
Why is that so important to you?

00:21:50.976 --> 00:21:54.880 line:95%,end
Well, it's my business
to make sure that she is the best

00:21:54.946 --> 00:21:56.114 line:95%,end
she can be.

00:21:56.181 --> 00:21:58.450 line:95%,end
So I will do whatever
it takes for my daughter

00:21:58.517 --> 00:22:02.554 line:95%,end
to feel good about herself
and to get her the best that I can.

00:22:02.621 --> 00:22:04.256 line:95%,end
Who else has a question for Jill?

00:22:04.323 --> 00:22:07.125 line:95%,end
My question is
why did you think that you had

00:22:07.192 --> 00:22:09.161 line:95%,end
to hide the private lessons?

00:22:09.227 --> 00:22:11.997 line:95%,end
OK, it really
wasn't even a private lesson.

00:22:12.064 --> 00:22:13.298 line:95%,end
Gianna had walked by.

00:22:13.365 --> 00:22:14.800 line:95%,end
And I said, can you look at her number?

00:22:14.866 --> 00:22:16.635 line:95%,end
And can you help her out?

00:22:16.702 --> 00:22:19.905 line:95%,end
But I think what our problem was,
it was a duet.

00:22:19.971 --> 00:22:24.042 line:95%,end
And when you do a duet,
it's all about doing it together.

00:22:24.109 --> 00:22:25.310 line:95%,end
- And she went--
- Absolutely.

00:22:25.377 --> 00:22:27.112 line:95%,end
--and had the private
lesson out in the hallway

00:22:27.179 --> 00:22:29.114 line:95%,end
and didn't think to call Nia in.

00:22:29.181 --> 00:22:31.316 line:95%,end
- Is that true?
- Um, that's true.

00:22:31.383 --> 00:22:32.351 line:95%,end
I didn't invite Nia.

00:22:32.417 --> 00:22:34.986 line:95%,end
I didn't see it as a private lesson

00:22:35.053 --> 00:22:41.493 line:95%,end
because what she was doing didn't really
pertain to the choreography of the duet.

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:43.995 line:95%,end
Unfortunately, Holly took offense to it.

00:22:44.062 --> 00:22:47.699 line:95%,end
And I would never offend
another child or a mom on purpose.

00:22:47.766 --> 00:22:49.668 line:95%,end
I guess I would think twice about having

00:22:49.735 --> 00:22:53.872 line:95%,end
her work on something in a duet
without the other child, but--

00:22:53.939 --> 00:22:55.107 line:95%,end
But you didn't think twice.

00:22:55.173 --> 00:22:58.543 line:95%,end
Because we confronted you
about it at the studio.

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:01.012 line:95%,end
And then two days later,
you did it at the competition.

00:23:01.079 --> 00:23:03.181 line:95%,end
Yeah, but it wasn't--
we're going to have to agree to disagree.

00:23:03.248 --> 00:23:05.717 line:95%,end
- It was not a private lesson.
- KELLY: There's a lot of that going on.

00:23:05.784 --> 00:23:07.619 line:95%,end
That's her job to do that.

00:23:07.686 --> 00:23:10.021 line:95%,end
It's not my job to run in
and say, "Wait, you can't help her

00:23:10.088 --> 00:23:11.556 line:95%,end
until I get all the other kids out here.

00:23:11.623 --> 00:23:13.091 line:95%,end
- You have to help everybody." No.
- Yeah.

00:23:13.158 --> 00:23:14.259 line:95%,end
This is another one of those

00:23:14.326 --> 00:23:15.961 line:95%,end
- we're never going to agree about that.
- JILL: No.

00:23:16.027 --> 00:23:16.995 line:95%,end
- JEFF: So let's just move on.
- We are not.

00:23:17.095 --> 00:23:19.030 line:95%,end
Aren't you glad you asked?
[laughter]

00:23:19.097 --> 00:23:21.800 line:95%,end
All right. Right now, we've got
another incredible performance.

00:23:21.867 --> 00:23:25.404 line:95%,end
Here's Chloe with a number
called "What About Mother."

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:28.540 line:5%,start
[applause]

Tell me, mother,

00:23:54.933 --> 00:24:00.772 line:95%,end
how to silence my mind.

00:24:00.839 --> 00:24:03.575 line:95%,end
Show me.

00:24:03.642 --> 00:24:06.778 line:95%,end
Show me, mother,

we weren't allowed to dedicate--

- JILL: We weren't allowed to touch that.

and I didn't have a big wedding.

- MELISSA: It's not--

00:29:18.723 --> 00:29:20.191 line:95%,end
I didn't do anything
behind anybody's back.

00:29:20.258 --> 00:29:21.359 line:95%,end
JILL: --a wedding is.

from the audience.

00:29:26.197 --> 00:29:27.132 line:95%,end
Who has a question for one of the ladies?

00:29:28.633 --> 00:29:32.070 line:95%,end
Hi. Mackenzie never danced
because she was injured.

00:29:32.537 --> 00:29:34.572 line:95%,end
And then she went on
to dance on "The View."

00:29:34.639 --> 00:29:36.608 line:95%,end
How do you all feel about that?

00:29:36.674 --> 00:29:38.209 line:95%,end
Well, I'll speak up, because I--

00:29:38.276 --> 00:29:41.212 line:95%,end
I was-- I spoke up
for Melissa at "The View."

00:29:41.279 --> 00:29:43.515 line:95%,end
Mackenzie's been a part of this team.

00:29:43.581 --> 00:29:46.851 line:95%,end
She-- She was on the award-winning team

00:29:46.918 --> 00:29:48.486 line:95%,end
that won Nationals.

00:29:48.553 --> 00:29:51.322 line:95%,end
It was only right for her
to dance at "The View."

00:29:51.389 --> 00:29:53.158 line:95%,end
I don't think
it was ever a question of Macken--

00:29:53.224 --> 00:29:55.393 line:95%,end
if it was right for Mackenzie
to dance on "The View."


00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:59.497 line:95%,end

herself made a huge deal

about Mackenzie's foot injury.

00:30:00.899 --> 00:30:02.066 line:95%,end

- She's gonna have to live with this--
- I never said that.

00:30:03.902 --> 00:30:05.436 line:95%,end
I mean, does everyone remember
her saying that?

00:30:05.503 --> 00:30:06.704 line:95%,end
- I--
- Thank you.

00:30:06.771 --> 00:30:08.039 line:95%,end
- She said--
- It came across that way.

00:30:08.106 --> 00:30:10.341 line:95%,end
- CHRISTI: She may never be able--
- OK, but I never said, "Oh, my God,

00:30:10.408 --> 00:30:11.509 line:95%,end
she's never gonna dance again.

00:30:11.643 --> 00:30:13.745 line:95%,end
You're the one
who made the big deal of it.

00:30:13.812 --> 00:30:15.246 line:95%,end
You took her to all these doctors.

00:30:15.313 --> 00:30:18.683 line:95%,end
She showed up in an Aircast
when she was to dance against Asia.

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:20.385 line:95%,end
That was before Asia.
I'm sorry.

00:30:20.451 --> 00:30:22.854 line:95%,end
Her foot was hurting
weeks before Asia came.

00:30:23.154 --> 00:30:26.124 line:95%,end
I think what everyone's problem was

00:30:26.191 --> 00:30:28.793 line:95%,end
is that you made such a big deal
out of the foot.

00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:31.930 line:95%,end
And then all of a sudden,
it was miraculously healed.

00:30:31.996 --> 00:30:33.531 line:95%,end
- It was like whoopee, healed.
- MELISSA: She didn't--

00:30:33.598 --> 00:30:34.732 line:95%,end
- It's "The View."
- MELISSA: --dance on her foot.

00:30:34.799 --> 00:30:36.100 line:95%,end
- Her foot is better.

and I'm still angry at her.

00:30:56.287 --> 00:30:57.989 line:95%,end
She never apologized.

and says things she shouldn't say--

like when we were watching this season,

that your relationship

- Yeah, you're right.

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:40.498 line:95%,end
She doesn't know
how to say Chloe's name either.

00:31:40.565 --> 00:31:43.468 line:95%,end
The only time that she does
say my name, I understand,

00:31:43.534 --> 00:31:45.169 line:95%,end
is when she's holding her meet and greets

00:31:45.236 --> 00:31:47.605 line:95%,end
and she wants to tell people
that I don't have a dance studio,

00:31:47.672 --> 00:31:50.408 line:95%,end
that I'm a terrible dance teacher
and this, that, and the other.

00:31:50.475 --> 00:31:53.177 line:95%,end
But really, in the grand scheme
of those-- those comments,

00:31:53.244 --> 00:31:56.180 line:95%,end
she's giving me publicity.
So I do need to thank her.

00:31:56.247 --> 00:31:59.484 line:95%,end
So as long as she keeps talking about me,
I know that she's threatened by me.

00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:01.019 line:95%,end
But that's why she doesn't say your name.

00:32:01.085 --> 00:32:02.353 line:95%,end
I don't think she's threatened by you.

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:04.689 line:95%,end
She's threatened
by the team that I've put together.

00:32:04.756 --> 00:32:07.191 line:95%,end
And I'm not doing
anything differently than she is.

00:32:07.258 --> 00:32:08.359 line:95%,end
Jill, I got a question for you.

00:32:08.426 --> 00:32:09.460 line:95%,end
Before Cathy came out here,

00:32:09.527 --> 00:32:11.129 line:95%,end
you said you were still
very upset with her.

00:32:11.195 --> 00:32:14.899 line:95%,end
I think it's disrespectful
to talk about a child.

00:32:14.966 --> 00:32:18.469 line:95%,end
OK. I have every right
as a dance teacher to critique.

00:32:18.536 --> 00:32:21.839 line:95%,end
If I were talking about Kendall,
saying, "Oh, that kid is so ugly

00:32:21.906 --> 00:32:23.574 line:95%,end
and I can't stand that kid,
she's a brat",

00:32:23.641 --> 00:32:25.343 line:95%,end
but what was said

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:27.145 line:95%,end
- was all constructive critiquing.
- JILL: No.

00:32:27.211 --> 00:32:28.646 line:95%,end
- It really wasn't.
- CATHY: What was it that I said?

00:32:28.713 --> 00:32:32.750 line:95%,end
It was disrespectful and rude
saying she has to hide behind a mask.

00:32:32.817 --> 00:32:34.886 line:95%,end
And you know you said it to be--

00:32:34.953 --> 00:32:36.354 line:95%,end
CATHY: But--
- --to get me going.

00:32:36.421 --> 00:32:37.555 line:95%,end
But you know-- JILL: And you did, so--

00:32:37.622 --> 00:32:38.756 line:95%,end
- But you know what, Jill?
- --you win.

00:32:38.823 --> 00:32:40.858 line:95%,end
Ultimately, I have the right to say that.

00:32:40.925 --> 00:32:43.561 line:95%,end
OK. So what-- what's your excuse
for doing it to Paige?

00:32:43.628 --> 00:32:45.063 line:95%,end
I did not do that to Paige.

00:32:45.129 --> 00:32:46.831 line:95%,end
Abby set your kid up.

00:32:46.898 --> 00:32:48.499 line:95%,end
And you need to know that, Kelly.

00:32:48.566 --> 00:32:49.801 line:95%,end
And I 100% agree.

00:32:49.867 --> 00:32:51.402 line:95%,end
You were clear down on the other end.

00:32:51.469 --> 00:32:52.837 line:95%,end
- You didn't even hear--
- Yeah, but I heard.

00:32:52.904 --> 00:32:54.739 line:95%,end
- CATHY: --that Anthony--
- We heard everything that was said.

00:32:54.906 --> 00:32:56.574 line:95%,end
She didn't hear.
She wasn't even near.

00:32:56.808 --> 00:33:00.044 line:95%,end
Let's do this. Let's find out
who has a question for-- for Cathy.

00:33:00.111 --> 00:33:01.713 line:95%,end
Cathy, what do you think about Jill?

00:33:01.779 --> 00:33:03.815 line:95%,end
For one, I think she's a studio-hopper.

00:33:03.915 --> 00:33:06.451 line:95%,end
And I had several students
who were on my team

00:33:06.517 --> 00:33:07.552 line:95%,end
last year that left,

00:33:07.652 --> 00:33:11.089 line:95%,end
and Jill has tried to befriend them
and sidle up to them for information.

00:33:11.155 --> 00:33:13.424 line:95%,end
Let me jump in right here, ladies.
I wanna thank you so much.

00:33:13.491 --> 00:33:16.728 line:95%,end
So, ladies, next up,

00:33:47.458 --> 00:33:53.931 line:95%,end
So I climbed a stony steeple

00:33:53.998 --> 00:33:59.737 line:95%,end
till the water climbed up
to my leg.

coming in style this way.

Oh, did you come in the big,
crappy bus from Pittsburgh?

00:34:48.352 --> 00:34:50.688 line:95%,end
- Cathy, go to hell!
- Oh--

00:34:50.755 --> 00:34:52.824 line:95%,end

hit me with your purse?

As you can see, Abby's returned.

00:35:21.018 --> 00:35:22.053 line:95%,end
So look, I want to get right to it.

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:24.822 line:95%,end
Last season, the biggest,
most explosive moment

00:35:24.889 --> 00:35:27.158 line:95%,end
the fans saw
was an altercation between you and Cathy

00:35:27.225 --> 00:35:29.093 line:95%,end
that got physical, let's say.

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:30.828 line:95%,end
Cathy, when you look back at that footage

00:35:30.895 --> 00:35:33.331 line:95%,end
and you see yourself
hitting Abby with a purse,

00:35:33.431 --> 00:35:34.899 line:95%,end
what do you think?

00:35:34.966 --> 00:35:38.169 line:95%,end
First of all, I don't consider that a hit.
It was a swat.

00:35:38.269 --> 00:35:39.837 line:95%,end
And the purse was this big.

00:35:39.904 --> 00:35:41.839 line:95%,end
It was a little patent leather purse.

00:35:41.906 --> 00:35:45.143 line:95%,end
And I'm sure that Abby's flu shot
hurt a heck of a lot worse

00:35:45.209 --> 00:35:46.577 line:95%,end
than the little swat.

00:35:46.644 --> 00:35:47.912 line:95%,end
And what do you think?

00:35:47.979 --> 00:35:52.350 line:95%,end
Oh, before she comments, I wanna add
that the reason that happened

00:35:52.416 --> 00:35:54.585 line:95%,end
- was because she threw water on me.
- Is that true?

00:35:54.652 --> 00:35:55.686 line:95%,end
You did throw water on her.

00:35:55.753 --> 00:35:57.788 line:95%,end
No, I did not throw water on her.

00:35:57.855 --> 00:35:59.090 line:95%,end
If I would have thrown water on her,

00:35:59.157 --> 00:36:00.424 line:95%,end
I would have hit her right in the face.

00:36:00.491 --> 00:36:02.026 line:95%,end
OK, so the sprinkler system
was going off.

00:36:02.093 --> 00:36:03.928 line:95%,end
- And no, I took--
- CATHY: Was that it was?

00:36:03.995 --> 00:36:07.598 line:95%,end
I took a bottle of water
that I had been drinking earlier.

00:36:07.999 --> 00:36:11.335 line:95%,end
And I said, "Let's see if she melts--"

00:36:11.402 --> 00:36:14.472 line:95%,end
- No, that's not how it went.
- --as in the Wicked Witch.

00:36:14.539 --> 00:36:17.008 line:95%,end
And the force of the water
inside the bottle

00:36:17.275 --> 00:36:19.076 line:95%,end
shoved the cap off the bottle.

00:36:19.277 --> 00:36:22.880 line:95%,end
You clearly hear me apologize
immediately and say, I'm sorry.

00:36:22.947 --> 00:36:24.949 line:95%,end
- Oh, no.
-I did not mean that to happen

00:36:25.016 --> 00:36:26.150 line:95%,end
You-- you did not apologize.

00:36:26.217 --> 00:36:30.254 line:95%,end
And then this psychotic
goes off and smacks me

00:36:30.321 --> 00:36:31.589 line:95%,end
- in the back with a pocketbook.
- Swat.

00:36:31.656 --> 00:36:32.924 line:95%,end
I swatted you. And it probably--

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:33.925 line:95%,end
- Doesn't matter.
- --didn't even hurt.

00:36:33.991 --> 00:36:35.493 line:95%,end
When you strike another person--

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:36.594 line:95%,end
- It probably didn't even hurt.
- --you have crossed the line.

00:36:36.661 --> 00:36:37.995 line:95%,end
- Well, then you shouldn't--
- End.

00:36:38.062 --> 00:36:39.463 line:95%,end
--throw water at people,
whether you want to play around

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:41.832 line:95%,end
and say that you wanna see if the Wicked
Witch is going to melt or not.

00:36:41.899 --> 00:36:45.069 line:95%,end
So if you would have never done that,
none of this would have happened.

00:36:45.136 --> 00:36:48.206 line:95%,end
And I would not have to talk
to the back of your head all the time.

00:36:48.406 --> 00:36:50.007 line:95%,end
Melissa took pictures of my bruises.

00:36:50.074 --> 00:36:52.076 line:95%,end
Oh, you hardly had bruises.

00:36:52.176 --> 00:36:56.147 line:95%,end
You act as though
this 90-pound weakling beat you up.

00:36:56.214 --> 00:36:57.982 line:95%,end
Cathy, then you came swinging at me.

00:36:58.049 --> 00:36:59.150 line:95%,end
After you poured-- listen--

00:36:59.217 --> 00:37:00.484 line:95%,end
- It doesn't matter.
- CATHY: Oh, it does--

00:37:00.551 --> 00:37:02.420 line:95%,end
- You don't hit.
- CATHY: --matter. You poured water on me!

00:37:02.486 --> 00:37:03.588 line:95%,end
You beat up Abby!

00:37:03.654 --> 00:37:05.456 line:95%,end
When did you become her bodyguard?

00:37:05.523 --> 00:37:07.658 line:95%,end
You should have just sat down and let Abby

00:37:07.725 --> 00:37:09.794 line:95%,end
and I finalize what was going on.

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:11.696 line:95%,end
You did not need to get involved.

00:37:11.829 --> 00:37:14.966 line:95%,end
Well, I think we can all agree
that hitting and throwing water,

00:37:15.032 --> 00:37:16.334 line:95%,end
those things probably
shouldn't happen in the future.

00:37:16.467 --> 00:37:17.401 line:95%,end
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:37:17.468 --> 00:37:18.836 line:95%,end
All right.
Let's see what the audience has to say.

00:37:18.903 --> 00:37:20.938 line:95%,end
Hi.
My question's for Abby.

00:37:21.005 --> 00:37:24.675 line:95%,end
So, Abby, in Detroit,
you told Cathy to go to hell.

00:37:24.775 --> 00:37:27.778 line:95%,end
I was just wondering
if you've ever said anything

00:37:27.845 --> 00:37:30.314 line:95%,end
- that you regret in front of the kids.
- No.

00:37:30.381 --> 00:37:32.416 line:95%,end
- Oh.
- On any normal given day,

00:37:32.483 --> 00:37:34.685 line:95%,end
I don't normally swear.

00:37:34.752 --> 00:37:36.220 line:95%,end
But because I showed up in a limo

00:37:36.287 --> 00:37:39.457 line:95%,end
and she was upset and jealous
and rattled, she had to swear.

00:37:39.523 --> 00:37:41.959 line:95%,end
I have-- a driver picked me up
in every single airport

00:37:42.026 --> 00:37:44.362 line:95%,end
for every promotion I do for "Dance Moms."

00:37:44.428 --> 00:37:45.529 line:95%,end
That's not a big deal.

00:37:45.596 --> 00:37:47.265 line:95%,end
Then start taking your team that way,

00:37:47.531 --> 00:37:50.635 line:95%,end
instead of-- instead of making them
go by themselves.

00:37:50.701 --> 00:37:52.536 line:95%,end
I don't need to take my team that way.

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:55.172 line:95%,end
Why? Why can't you do something nice
for them once in a while?


00:37:55.239 --> 00:37:56.274 line:95%,end
Yeah. But you came out,

00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:58.209 line:95%,end
and you wanted to rub it
in all of our faces.

00:37:58.276 --> 00:38:00.511 line:95%,end
- CATHY: Well, does she not--
- I do not solicit students.

00:38:00.611 --> 00:38:03.547 line:95%,end
Does she not-- neither do I.
Do you know something I don't know?

00:38:03.614 --> 00:38:05.049 line:95%,end
How do I solicit those students?

00:38:05.116 --> 00:38:07.685 line:95%,end
I know that every single one of those boys
would rather be dancing for me.

00:38:07.752 --> 00:38:09.220 line:95%,end
Oh, I don't think so, Abby.

00:38:09.287 --> 00:38:10.821 line:95%,end
Let's take another question
from the audience.

00:38:10.888 --> 00:38:12.189 line:95%,end
Who's got a question
for one of the ladies?

00:38:12.857 --> 00:38:16.160 line:95%,end
Have any of you ever heard
Abby say I'm sorry?

00:38:16.494 --> 00:38:18.696 line:95%,end
- Oh, no.
- No.

00:38:18.763 --> 00:38:20.665 line:95%,end
- She apologized to Cathy--
- Oh, she apologized to-- yeah.

00:38:20.731 --> 00:38:21.999 line:95%,end
- She said to that Cathy.
- --from throwing water on her.

- But--
- MELISSA: Yes.

00:38:23.934 --> 00:38:24.935 line:95%,end
--I don't-- I don't know
about to the children.

00:38:25.002 --> 00:38:26.170 line:95%,end
Well, listen. Thank you, ladies.

00:38:26.237 --> 00:38:27.371 line:95%,end
It's time for the last
number of the night.

00:38:27.438 --> 00:38:29.340 line:95%,end
Now this performance
was really controversial.

00:38:29.407 --> 00:38:31.542 line:95%,end
I did this piece 12 years ago.

00:38:31.609 --> 00:38:36.714 line:95%,end
And it was in the headlines then,
and it's still happening.

00:38:36.781 --> 00:38:38.849 line:95%,end
If these kids can do a routine
and get a message

00:38:38.916 --> 00:38:41.419 line:95%,end
across to an audience, it's worth doing.

00:38:41.485 --> 00:38:45.356 line:95%,end
Let's take a look at the kids
doing this number called "Runaways."

00:38:45.556 --> 00:38:47.491 line:95%,end

Thanks, girls.
That was amazing.

00:40:13.711 --> 00:40:15.513 line:95%,end
What a great job.
And thank you, Abby.

00:40:15.579 --> 00:40:17.081 line:95%,end

JEFF: Next time on "Dance Moms Tell All."

00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:34.331 line:95%,end
ABBY: There was a lot of jealousy.

00:40:34.398 --> 00:40:36.066 line:5%,start
They've been
running off customers for years.

00:40:36.133 --> 00:40:37.568 line:5%,start
I'm not here to make friends.

00:40:37.635 --> 00:40:40.905 line:5%,start
I was dropping Christi
as a friend for you.

00:40:41.539 --> 00:40:42.907 line:5%,start
Why are they crying?

00:40:42.973 --> 00:40:44.208 line:5%,start
If they're going to cry,

00:40:44.275 --> 00:40:45.509 line:5%,start
they're not gonna make it
in the world of dance.

00:40:45.576 --> 00:40:48.045 line:5%,start
I don't want her
to have these experiences.

00:40:48.112 --> 00:40:49.914 line:5%,start
I don't want people
to think that it's all about

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:50.981 line:5%,start
the screaming and yelling.

00:40:51.048 --> 00:40:52.283 line:5%,start
Where were you guys three years ago?

00:40:52.349 --> 00:40:54.118 line:5%,start
Crap like you
should be shoved down a toilet.

00:40:54.185 --> 00:40:56.454 line:5%,start
We beat you.
So that's how crappy I am.

00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:58.222 line:5%,start
Look at your poor,
pathetic mother over there.

00:40:58.289 --> 00:41:00.224 line:5%,start
Did you just call my mother pathetic?

00:41:00.291 --> 00:41:02.626 line:5%,start
I don't care.
She's nothing to me, and neither are you.
