Soldiers, are you ready?

00:00:06.172 --> 00:00:07.807 line:5%,start
- What about me?
- What about you?

00:00:08.375 --> 00:00:09.476 line:5%,start
You're on suspension.

00:00:10.477 --> 00:00:11.711 line:5%,start
That's good right there.

00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:13.313 line:5%,start
[laughs] That's it.
Good, good, good.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.748 line:5%,start
I had some new head shots taken.

00:00:14.814 --> 00:00:17.584 line:5%,start
OK.
Woo, that's beautiful.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.352 line:5%,start
I'm gonna take Kenzie to the hospital.

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:21.688 line:5%,start
Mackenzie actually
hurt her foot two weeks ago.

00:00:21.755 --> 00:00:23.289 line:5%,start
- Don't lie for your kids.
- I'm not. I watched her!

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:24.958 line:5%,start

yourself as it is.

ABBY LEE (VOICEOVER):
Coming up on "Dance Moms."

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:35.902 line:5%,start
Group routine is about Rosa Parks.

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:38.138 line:5%,start
Do something with that face!

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:40.640 line:5%,start
We won last time.
Remember that.

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:41.808 line:5%,start
Can I have an amen?

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:43.043 line:5%,start
ALL: Amen!

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:44.477 line:5%,start
I can't choreograph
with you sitting over here.

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:46.179 line:5%,start
Maybe if we throw a stick,
she'll leave.

00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:48.548 line:5%,start
I'm not the one
that fell down the ugly tree.

00:00:48.615 --> 00:00:50.717 line:5%,start
I'm really not sure
who I want to use as Rosa Parks.

00:00:50.784 --> 00:00:52.252 line:5%,start
Let's give it to one of the blondes.

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:55.822 line:5%,start
What's the status with Rosa Parks?

00:00:57.023 --> 00:00:59.092 line:5%,start
Christi and Kelly are going berserk.

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:00.894 line:5%,start
She just threw all of us under the bus.

MELISSA (VOICEOVER): I'm really worried
when Abby comes into Pyramid

00:01:23.316 --> 00:01:25.218 line:95%,end
what she's going to say
about seventh place.

00:01:25.285 --> 00:01:28.922 line:5%,start
We're normally in the top three,
and that's even hard to take.

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:30.223 line:5%,start
Seventh is awful.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.260 line:5%,start
In seventh place,
with a score of 274.2 points

00:01:34.327 --> 00:01:37.397 line:95%,end
is Act Number 84, "Don't Ask, Just Tell."

[tense music]

what does the Abby Lee Dance Company

00:01:43.837 --> 00:01:47.674 line:95%,end
need to do to get back
to first overall high score?

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:51.044 line:95%,end
We went all the way to Minnesota.

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:52.512 line:95%,end
I've never been there before,

00:01:53.146 --> 00:01:55.048 line:95%,end
and I'm probably never going back.

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:58.084 line:95%,end
Our top soloist couldn't even win.

00:01:58.518 --> 00:02:01.421 line:95%,end
All right, now for the Pyramid--

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:04.757 line:95%,end
Mackenzie.

00:02:07.527 --> 00:02:09.462 line:95%,end
I told you to stay off of your foot.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.533 line:95%,end
I even went and got you a wheelchair

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:17.203 line:95%,end
so that you weren't standing
on hard cement all day long,

00:02:17.337 --> 00:02:18.571 line:95%,end
but you didn't listen.

00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:20.173 line:95%,end
You were hopping all over the place.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.143 line:5%,start
ABBY LEE (VOICEOVER): Melissa
claims that she's injured,

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.546 line:5%,start
and then the next day she's fine
and she can dance again.

00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:28.615 line:95%,end
I don't know what to really believe.

00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:30.950 line:95%,end
This week, you are benched.

00:02:31.017 --> 00:02:32.452 line:95%,end
You will not be performing.

00:02:34.587 --> 00:02:35.622 line:95%,end
Paige.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.792 line:95%,end
You do a good job.
It's fine.

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:42.128 line:95%,end
But I don't want good.
I don't want fine.

00:02:42.195 --> 00:02:44.297 line:5%,start
Paige could win a Nobel Prize,

00:02:44.364 --> 00:02:46.366 line:5%,start
and she would still be
at the bottom of the Pyramid.

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:51.738 line:95%,end
Brooke. But in the group dance,
you're almost lethargic.

00:02:51.804 --> 00:02:53.673 line:95%,end
You move slow.

00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:55.775 line:95%,end
You don't have a lot of (SNAPPING) zip,

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:57.076 line:95%,end
a lot of energy.

00:02:58.478 --> 00:03:00.580 line:95%,end
KELLY (VOICEOVER): I don't know
if it has something to do with me.

00:03:00.647 --> 00:03:03.616 line:95%,end
But no matter what my kids do,
they're always at the bottom.

00:03:04.417 --> 00:03:05.418 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: Chloe.

00:03:07.053 --> 00:03:08.588 line:95%,end
Have you learned your lesson?

00:03:08.655 --> 00:03:10.056 line:95%,end
I hope so.

00:03:10.123 --> 00:03:12.492 line:95%,end
Chloe is suspended.
So is her mother.

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:14.060 line:95%,end
Replace us.
That's fine.

00:03:14.761 --> 00:03:16.429 line:95%,end
CHRISTI (VOICEOVER):
I don't like the Pyramid,

00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:18.965 line:5%,start
but I have really been trying
to behave myself,

00:03:19.032 --> 00:03:22.368 line:5%,start
because it really means a lot
for Chloe to be on that Pyramid.

00:03:22.435 --> 00:03:28.374 line:5%,start
Moving on up, Maddie,
second two weeks in a row.

00:03:28.441 --> 00:03:31.110 line:95%,end
We're gonna see,
do you have what it takes?

00:03:31.177 --> 00:03:32.812 line:95%,end
Can you get past second?

00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:38.851 line:95%,end
Next, Kendall.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.289 line:95%,end
Jill, I used your new head shot
that you gave me.

00:03:43.356 --> 00:03:45.058 line:95%,end
JILL (VOICEOVER): I got
some gorgeous head shots

00:03:45.124 --> 00:03:46.326 line:95%,end
made for Kendall.

00:03:46.392 --> 00:03:48.695 line:5%,start
Abby loved them.
She put it on the Pyramid.

00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:50.863 line:95%,end
KELLY (VOICEOVER): I didn't get
the memo that we were supposed

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.266 line:95%,end
to stop and get new head shots
for Pyramid this week.

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:55.635 line:95%,end
Jill always has the one-up everybody.

00:03:55.702 --> 00:03:56.936 line:95%,end
- MELISSA: It's beautiful.
- Do you guys like it?

00:03:57.303 --> 00:03:59.672 line:95%,end
I didn't realize we were doing
new head shots for the Pyramid.

00:04:00.206 --> 00:04:01.474 line:95%,end
Um--

00:04:01.941 --> 00:04:05.111 line:95%,end
HOLLY (VOICEOVER): You never quite
know what to expect from Jill.

00:04:05.478 --> 00:04:10.049 line:5%,start
She claims she's not sneaky,
but there's always some surprise.

00:04:10.116 --> 00:04:11.684 line:95%,end
Kendall's a pretty girl.

00:04:11.784 --> 00:04:15.054 line:95%,end
You have the face, but you go
on stage and you don't use it.

00:04:16.356 --> 00:04:17.957 line:95%,end
And on top of the Pyramid
this week

00:04:19.425 --> 00:04:21.160 line:95%,end
- is Nia.
- [applause]

00:04:21.227 --> 00:04:22.595 line:95%,end
HOLLY (VOICEOVER): I'm ecstatic.

00:04:22.662 --> 00:04:26.132 line:95%,end
I am absolutely ecstatic that
Nia's on the top of the Pyramid.

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:27.600 line:95%,end
I thought you looked great.

00:04:27.667 --> 00:04:30.336 line:95%,end
Your face was off the charts.

00:04:30.403 --> 00:04:32.038 line:95%,end
You were Beyonce up there.

00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:33.539 line:95%,end
- I like that.
- Nia Fierce.

00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:34.641 line:95%,end
Mm-hmm.

00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:37.543 line:95%,end
It's a pay-off of all of that hard work,

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.612 line:95%,end
and it means
a tremendous amount to her.

00:04:41.347 --> 00:04:43.883 line:95%,end
Now, this week,
we will be attending

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:47.754 line:95%,end
Powerhouse Dance Competition
in Cincinnati, Ohio.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.857 line:95%,end
And I have a rotten feeling
that you-know-who


00:04:50.923 --> 00:04:52.292 line:95%,end
is going to be there.

00:04:52.358 --> 00:04:55.628 line:95%,end
The last time we faced Cathy, she beat us,

00:04:55.695 --> 00:04:57.997 line:95%,end
and that can't ever happen again.

00:04:58.564 --> 00:05:01.701 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE (VOICEOVER): There's nothing
that ruins a competition like Cathy.

00:05:01.768 --> 00:05:05.038 line:95%,end
The group routine is about Rosa Parks.

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:08.474 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Rosa Parks
served as a catalyst

00:05:08.541 --> 00:05:12.078 line:95%,end
for a civil rights movement
by refusing to stand up

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:13.880 line:95%,end
and give up her seat on a bus.

00:05:13.946 --> 00:05:16.516 line:5%,start
I didn't really learn
about Rosa Parks in school,

00:05:16.582 --> 00:05:19.319 line:5%,start
but I know who she is because of my mom.

00:05:19.385 --> 00:05:23.923 line:95%,end
She broke down barriers,
and she united entire races.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.993 line:95%,end
I like routines
that move the judges in some way.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.397 line:95%,end
If the girls just do exactly
what they're supposed to do,

00:05:31.464 --> 00:05:33.333 line:95%,end
we may not be second.

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:35.301 line:95%,end
We may actually win this time.

00:05:35.768 --> 00:05:37.570 line:95%,end
Since Nia's at the top
of the Pyramid

00:05:37.637 --> 00:05:39.505 line:95%,end
and if the dance is called Rosa Parks,

00:05:39.572 --> 00:05:42.542 line:95%,end
then obviously
this is a part destined for Nia.

00:05:42.608 --> 00:05:44.143 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: Don't assume anything.

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.713 line:95%,end
I have no idea who will play Rosa Parks.

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:47.880 line:95%,end
[clears throat]

00:05:47.947 --> 00:05:49.215 line:95%,end
[laughter]

00:05:49.282 --> 00:05:50.450 line:95%,end
Really?

00:05:50.516 --> 00:05:51.818 line:95%,end
I'm just saying.

00:05:51.884 --> 00:05:55.221 line:95%,end
I absolutely want Nia
to play the role of Rosa Parks,

00:05:55.288 --> 00:05:58.558 line:95%,end
but this is the big lead role
in the number this week.

00:05:58.624 --> 00:06:00.860 line:95%,end
She has to give it her all

00:06:00.927 --> 00:06:04.397 line:95%,end
before I'm even gonna let her know
that the part is hers.

00:06:04.464 --> 00:06:05.998 line:95%,end
HOLLY (VOICEOVER): I'm annoyed.

00:06:06.065 --> 00:06:10.370 line:95%,end
Here is finally a part from Nia,
and Abby's playing games.

00:06:10.436 --> 00:06:12.271 line:95%,end
Holly, what's going
on with the short skirt?

00:06:12.338 --> 00:06:15.074 line:95%,end
And your hair is in your face.
I mean, come on.

00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:16.609 line:95%,end
I'm surprised you don't like my style.

00:06:16.676 --> 00:06:17.877 line:95%,end
I don't.

00:06:18.244 --> 00:06:20.980 line:95%,end
Who is Abby to be calling Holly out
on her fashion sense?

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:23.916 line:95%,end
I mean, really?
My favorite part about Abby's accessories

00:06:23.983 --> 00:06:27.520 line:95%,end
is that they're all organized
in a shoe box by color--

00:06:27.587 --> 00:06:32.024 line:95%,end
red plastic rhinestone crap,
blue plastic rhinestone crap.

00:06:32.091 --> 00:06:34.927 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: I don't know. I just think that
an award-winning costume designer

00:06:34.994 --> 00:06:36.529 line:95%,end
would have picked something better.

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:39.265 line:95%,end
The judges award for Fierce Costume--

00:06:39.332 --> 00:06:41.100 line:5%,start
congratulations
to Number 25.

00:06:41.167 --> 00:06:42.802 line:5%,start
[applause]

00:06:43.336 --> 00:06:45.338 line:5%,start
And who made your costume?

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:46.973 line:95%,end
Well, my mom made my costume.

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:48.207 line:95%,end
ANNOUNCER 1: Congratulations.

00:06:48.274 --> 00:06:50.977 line:95%,end
You have stylist on your resume now, too?

00:06:51.043 --> 00:06:55.014 line:95%,end
Oh, I've been dressing people for years.

00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:56.983 line:95%,end
I've been dying to spruce up

00:06:57.049 --> 00:06:58.317 line:95%,end
Holly a little bit.

00:06:58.384 --> 00:07:01.954 line:95%,end
So with the Rosa Parks
thing dangling over her head,

00:07:02.021 --> 00:07:03.589 line:95%,end
this might just be the week.

00:07:05.124 --> 00:07:06.259 line:95%,end
Kendall?

00:07:06.325 --> 00:07:08.661 line:95%,end
You will be doing a solo
again this weekend.

00:07:08.728 --> 00:07:11.664 line:95%,end
The name of your routine
is "Look At Me Now."

00:07:11.731 --> 00:07:14.734 line:95%,end
We're going to do some exercises
about this face.

00:07:14.801 --> 00:07:16.803 line:95%,end
My other solo will go to Maddie.

00:07:18.337 --> 00:07:22.041 line:95%,end
The name of your routine this week
is breaking down walls.

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:24.977 line:95%,end
Now, remember, I gave you a lifeline.

00:07:25.044 --> 00:07:26.212 line:95%,end
You dropped it.

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:28.481 line:95%,end
You had to climb up a hill,
and you rolled back down.

00:07:29.048 --> 00:07:32.285 line:95%,end
I was really sad
that I won second place last week,

00:07:32.351 --> 00:07:34.654 line:95%,end
but I'm really happy
now that Miss Abby gave me

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.255 line:95%,end
another chance, so I can win.

00:07:36.322 --> 00:07:39.292 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: We're going to see,
do you have what it takes?

00:07:39.692 --> 00:07:41.861 line:95%,end
I have one more routine.

00:07:42.228 --> 00:07:46.866 line:95%,end
Paige, for years, you have begged me
to do a duet with Chloe.

00:07:46.933 --> 00:07:49.769 line:95%,end
And all this time,
I've been waiting for you

00:07:49.836 --> 00:07:51.671 line:95%,end
to step it up to her level.

00:07:51.737 --> 00:07:53.206 line:95%,end
So I don't have
to wait any longer

00:07:53.806 --> 00:07:57.877 line:95%,end
because, Chloe, you've slipped
down to that level.

00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:00.613 line:95%,end
So Chloe has to be bad
for Paige to get a dance?

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:01.981 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: No.

00:08:02.048 --> 00:08:03.716 line:95%,end
KELLY (VOICEOVER): Abby has
to totally ruin the moment

00:08:03.783 --> 00:08:07.353 line:95%,end
and be like, Paige,
you haven't had a duet with Chloe

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:10.823 line:95%,end
because you don't dance as good as Chloe.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:13.192 line:95%,end
But now that Chloe isn't dancing so well,

00:08:13.259 --> 00:08:15.027 line:95%,end
you can have a duet with her.

00:08:16.095 --> 00:08:19.398 line:95%,end
The name of your duet
is "Broadway Blondes."

00:08:19.465 --> 00:08:22.168 line:95%,end
The style of your routine is jazz.

00:08:22.235 --> 00:08:24.337 line:95%,end
Ladies, I'm going
to ask you to spread apart.

00:08:24.403 --> 00:08:26.339 line:95%,end
We're going to get started
on the group routine.

00:08:26.405 --> 00:08:28.040 line:95%,end
Moms, you're dismissed.

00:08:28.107 --> 00:08:29.175 line:95%,end
Go head upstairs.

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:33.045 line:95%,end
Chloe's back on the Pyramid.

00:08:33.112 --> 00:08:35.948 line:95%,end
Who would have ever thought I'd be
excited to be on the Pyramid.

CHRISTI (VOICEOVER):
This season has really been rough

00:08:37.984 --> 00:08:39.819 line:95%,end

00:08:39.886 --> 00:08:41.888 line:95%,end
you know, strikes, injuries.

00:08:41.954 --> 00:08:43.289 line:95%,end
- Oh, my gosh.
- It's taken 12 weeks

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:45.091 line:95%,end
to get those seven little girls back
on that Pyramid.

00:08:45.157 --> 00:08:46.626 line:95%,end
- KELLY: Wow.
- Really?

00:08:46.692 --> 00:08:49.061 line:95%,end
It is so great
to have the team together.

00:08:49.395 --> 00:08:51.330 line:95%,end
- It's nice to see Nia at the top.
- Yeah.

00:08:51.397 --> 00:08:53.065 line:95%,end
I'm really excited about that.

00:08:53.132 --> 00:08:54.567 line:95%,end
That was a surprise.

00:08:54.634 --> 00:08:55.868 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: Nia, come here.

00:08:55.935 --> 00:08:57.370 line:95%,end
I want you to demonstrate
this for everyone--

00:08:57.436 --> 00:09:00.506 line:95%,end
inverted knee and a dÃ©veloppÃ©,
and you can step to upstage.

00:09:02.842 --> 00:09:05.011 line:95%,end
Did you see her face
when she said Rosa Parks?

00:09:05.077 --> 00:09:06.779 line:95%,end
I know.
Nia was beaming.

00:09:06.846 --> 00:09:08.848 line:95%,end
And then she goes, make no assumptions.

00:09:08.915 --> 00:09:09.982 line:95%,end
Like, really?

00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:11.751 line:95%,end
Let's give it to one of the blondes.

00:09:12.351 --> 00:09:13.786 line:95%,end
HOLLY (VOICEOVER): I'm shocked.

00:09:13.853 --> 00:09:15.521 line:95%,end
She doesn't know
who's going to play Rosa Parks.

00:09:15.588 --> 00:09:18.057 line:95%,end
Well, Rosa Parks
is standing right in front of you.

00:09:18.124 --> 00:09:19.392 line:95%,end
JILL: No, she has to get the part.

00:09:19.458 --> 00:09:20.660 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Oh, my God.

00:09:20.726 --> 00:09:22.395 line:95%,end
Because if not,
can you imagine if she was like,

00:09:22.461 --> 00:09:24.163 line:95%,end
Chloe, you're going to be Rosa Parks?

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.365 line:95%,end
Like, how could you make
Chloe look like Rosa Parks

00:09:26.432 --> 00:09:27.867 line:95%,end
without being too controversial?

00:09:27.934 --> 00:09:29.702 line:95%,end
Oh, boy. Wah.

00:09:29.769 --> 00:09:31.771 line:95%,end
I don't know
what Abby's thinking.

00:09:31.837 --> 00:09:34.607 line:95%,end
I mean, clearly, Nia should
be the one to play Rosa Parks.

00:09:34.674 --> 00:09:36.709 line:95%,end
Anything else would be inappropriate.

00:09:37.143 --> 00:09:39.779 line:95%,end

Mackenzie?


00:09:41.948 --> 00:09:43.816 line:95%,end
Do you know what being benched is?

00:09:44.884 --> 00:09:51.757 line:5%,start
Being benched means that
either you have an injury or, like--

00:09:52.458 --> 00:09:54.827 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: I'm the referee,
and I benched you.

00:09:55.628 --> 00:09:58.230 line:95%,end
I told you I wanted you
to stay off of that foot.

00:09:58.297 --> 00:09:59.865 line:95%,end
You were hopping all over the place.

00:10:00.499 --> 00:10:02.335 line:95%,end
And look, you're still all taped up.

00:10:02.401 --> 00:10:05.504 line:95%,end
Miss Abby benches me
because last week

00:10:05.571 --> 00:10:08.574 line:95%,end
she thinks that I was doing
cartwheels on my other foot,

00:10:08.641 --> 00:10:09.675 line:95%,end
but I wasn't.

ABBY LEE (VOICEOVER):
This Rosa Parks routine

00:10:19.352 --> 00:10:23.589 line:95%,end
is extremely technical,
and the girls are so sloppy.

00:10:23.656 --> 00:10:25.625 line:95%,end
The timing was really off.

00:10:25.691 --> 00:10:27.960 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE (VOICEOVER): I can't
get through more than 5 seconds

00:10:28.027 --> 00:10:30.696 line:95%,end
without stopping somebody
to correct something

00:10:30.763 --> 00:10:32.064 line:95%,end
they should already know!

Both of you are off the music.

00:10:33.899 --> 00:10:37.703 line:95%,end
We just told Brooke
and Paige the same thing.

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:41.707 line:95%,end
These girls are rehearsing like
they're seventh-place dancers--

00:10:41.774 --> 00:10:43.809 line:95%,end
--not national champions.

00:10:44.276 --> 00:10:46.445 line:95%,end
And I think their mothers are to blame.

00:10:48.047 --> 00:10:51.417 line:95%,end
She can't let you walk out of there
feeling good about yourself.

00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:53.686 line:95%,end
She could ruin anything.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.390 line:95%,end
Holly is angry
about the Rosa Parks situation.

00:10:57.456 --> 00:10:59.992 line:95%,end
Kelly is mad about the duet.

00:11:00.059 --> 00:11:01.527 line:95%,end
I don't even want my kid to do it.

00:11:01.594 --> 00:11:02.728 line:95%,end
JILL: Why?

00:11:02.795 --> 00:11:05.398 line:95%,end
Because she pretty much said my kid sucks.

00:11:05.464 --> 00:11:07.533 line:95%,end
That's why she never had one.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.735 line:95%,end
Oh, Kelly, please don't take
that away from them.

00:11:11.003 --> 00:11:13.139 line:95%,end
Well, no, thanks. I'll pass.

00:11:13.205 --> 00:11:14.240 line:95%,end
Give it to somebody else.

00:11:15.207 --> 00:11:17.009 line:95%,end
Shut up.
They've waited forever.

00:11:17.076 --> 00:11:18.411 line:95%,end
Quit stealing their joy.

done what we started earlier perfectly,
we would be going on right now,

because you don't really care!

Who's she yelling at?

00:11:31.157 --> 00:11:32.725 line:95%,end
We're doing a routine about Rosa Parks!

00:11:32.792 --> 00:11:34.060 line:95%,end
She cared!

00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:36.796 line:95%,end
She stood up for it!
She was arrested!

00:11:36.862 --> 00:11:40.366 line:95%,end
She went to jail for something
she was passionate about.

00:11:40.433 --> 00:11:42.668 line:95%,end
You don't care if you win or not.

00:11:42.735 --> 00:11:45.271 line:95%,end
You care how many Instagram
things you get.

I'm sick of the negativity.
It spreads like wildfire to these girls,

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:53.746 line:95%,end
and I'm the one left
to pick up the pieces.

00:11:53.813 --> 00:11:54.880 line:95%,end

Last time we saw Abby, we won.

We won big time,
and, boy, did it feel good.

00:12:22.608 --> 00:12:26.912 line:5%,start
But my question to you is was it luck?

00:12:28.681 --> 00:12:30.616 line:5%,start
We need to stay on top of things.

00:12:30.683 --> 00:12:34.820 line:5%,start
We need to be at our best,
better than our best, every time.

00:12:34.887 --> 00:12:37.022 line:5%,start
So we won.
All is good.

00:12:37.089 --> 00:12:39.759 line:5%,start
We're going to win again
when we go to competition.

I've always known that my boys
are better dancers than Abby's girls,

I'd like to talk about the Pyramid.

Brandon, I think that
you've got so much to give.

00:12:54.406 --> 00:12:56.742 line:95%,end
You've got this ultimate dazzling smile,

00:12:56.809 --> 00:13:00.713 line:95%,end
but I need to see your dancing
dazzle as much as your smile.

00:13:01.247 --> 00:13:04.583 line:95%,end
Nick, do you know how many
dancers in the country

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:06.051 line:5%,start
want this opportunity?

00:13:06.118 --> 00:13:07.353 line:5%,start
And we came after you.

Gino, you are like
the most fabulous turner.

00:13:14.059 --> 00:13:18.764 line:5%,start
Don't let your perfectionism
get in the way

00:13:18.831 --> 00:13:21.333 line:5%,start
so that it becomes a negative, OK?

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:25.771 line:5%,start
All right, so that leaves us
to the top of the Pyramid.

00:13:28.674 --> 00:13:29.909 line:5%,start
Yeah.

00:13:30.776 --> 00:13:35.080 line:5%,start
So we are going to do a dance
that's called "Candy Apple Style,"

00:13:35.147 --> 00:13:38.884 line:5%,start
and it is a takeoff
of the "Gangnam Style."

and his crazy moves that he does.

I think this is gonna knock Abby Lee
right off of her high--

no, she doesn't wear high heels.

00:13:54.033 --> 00:13:55.634 line:5%,start
It's going to knock her socks off.

00:13:55.701 --> 00:13:59.271 line:5%,start
And then, let's see, we still
have to talk about our soloist.

Jalen, you will be doing
a solo this week, OK?

I would take fashion advice from,

No.

under the bus for typecasting.

ABBY LEE (VOICEOVER): You'd think

00:16:44.737 --> 00:16:47.106 line:95%,end
Holly would want me to give her
the part because she deserves it,

and that's exactly
what I'm going to do.

to make her a better dancer.

So Abby, what's the status
with Rosa Parks?

Kendall's never had special parts,

the poor kid ever gets.

all these tutorials,

about it to anyone who cares.

the idea to do that?

MELISSA: I don't know.

00:30:11.676 --> 00:30:15.380 line:95%,end
So she not only did the tutorial,
filmed herself,

00:30:15.446 --> 00:30:18.316 line:95%,end
had her materials,
and then she actually put it up

00:30:18.383 --> 00:30:20.718 line:95%,end
on the internet? Boy.

So Melissa, you're telling me
you let her in a room by herself,

00:30:24.556 --> 00:30:27.325 line:95%,end
and you don't know
what she's doing behind a locked door?

00:30:27.392 --> 00:30:29.494 line:95%,end
But, you know, she figured
out how to get my credit card

- number to do iTunes.
- Oh--

00:30:32.197 --> 00:30:35.867 line:95%,end
It's hard for Mackenzie
sometimes to be in Maddie's shadow.

00:30:35.934 --> 00:30:38.469 line:95%,end
And I'm glad for her
because she's not dancing,


00:30:38.536 --> 00:30:41.606 line:95%,end

also nailing the emotional execution.

it seems that

Cathy has painted
the exterior of her studio.

Everything Cathy touches turns tacky.

She has these big red tomatoes
painted on her wall.

I would like to know
how she spelled Candy Apple,

because she had it Apple's,
like the apple owned the studio.

00:38:48.292 --> 00:38:50.161 line:95%,end
Cathy probably thinks
she's so high class

I have to do some shopping
for Jalen's solo costume,

and I thought that I could spend
some one-on-one time with Vivi.

00:39:15.853 --> 00:39:19.190 line:95%,end
Because Jalen moves on his
head and that sort of stuff,

are going to move.

that out on the floor for me

duet costume is pushing it.

But if I go to Abby and complain,

she's going to take the duet
away from Chloe and Paige.

I don't know if I want them wearing
those costumes in front of the boys.

I guess I'll just look at these costumes

00:41:29.353 --> 00:41:32.556 line:95%,end

and they're at the pool.

We're on borrowed time here,

I do this with Vivi every morning.

build this shirt
on the front of this shirt.

The name of Jalen's routine
is "Working 9 to 5."

And he is going to portray
three different professions.

He's incorporating his dance skills,
along with movable takeoff props.

Think timing. You going to toss.
Foom.

00:42:18.669 --> 00:42:21.171 line:95%,end
So look, first of all,
you got to look where you throwing

so you can see, foom, foom, fa,

From this position, Jalen,
since you have the rag in your hand--

00:42:35.686 --> 00:42:37.755 line:95%,end
- is this the transition position?
- Yeah.

00:42:37.821 --> 00:42:41.825 line:95%,end
Why don't you go from here,
spin into a ninja, drop,

00:42:41.892 --> 00:42:43.627 line:95%,end
then you can come up changing?

00:42:43.694 --> 00:42:45.796 line:95%,end
It's kind of disrespectful
to a choreographer

when there's an outside voice
harboring over your shoulder.

But you could
almost just leave that on the floor

Paige is the one
who begged me for this duet.

00:43:15.225 --> 00:43:18.195 line:95%,end
And I figured
since Chloe wasn't at her peak,

00:43:18.262 --> 00:43:21.899 line:95%,end
this would be the perfect time
to bring these two girls together.

But right now, Paige is not cutting it,

00:43:24.602 --> 00:43:28.138 line:95%,end

01:19:04.973 --> 01:19:06.908 line:95%,end
These moms are mistaken
if they think

01:19:06.975 --> 01:19:08.944 line:95%,end
that they can intimidate me.

01:19:09.010 --> 01:19:12.114 line:95%,end
They may have a win today,
but it's not going to happen again.

01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:14.049 line:95%,end
Your son did two minutes of the dance

01:19:14.116 --> 01:19:16.785 line:95%,end
because, obviously,
he can't do the dancing portion of it.

01:19:16.852 --> 01:19:18.220 line:95%,end
He can only do the hip hop.

01:19:18.286 --> 01:19:22.324 line:95%,end
What has your child done
outside of this on their own?

01:19:23.058 --> 01:19:24.326 line:95%,end
Simmer down!

01:19:24.392 --> 01:19:26.762 line:95%,end
This guy's kid has more talent
in his little finger than your kid.

01:19:26.828 --> 01:19:28.263 line:95%,end
Oh, wait a minute, Kelly.

01:19:28.330 --> 01:19:29.931 line:95%,end
KELLY: Because he can do
more styles of dance.

01:19:29.998 --> 01:19:32.400 line:95%,end
- CATHY: Kelly--
- Yours can only spin on his head.

01:19:32.467 --> 01:19:35.337 line:95%,end
Every time I've seen your kids,
they do the exact same move!

01:19:35.403 --> 01:19:36.538 line:95%,end
There's nothing different.

01:19:36.605 --> 01:19:38.306 line:95%,end
CATHY (VOICEOVER): Kelly's throwing
a lot of stones

01:19:38.373 --> 01:19:40.675 line:95%,end
for someone
whose daughter forgot the routine.

01:19:40.742 --> 01:19:43.445 line:95%,end
My routine had no mistakes.

01:19:43.512 --> 01:19:45.614 line:95%,end
Oh, Kelly, how soon we forget.

01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:47.549 line:95%,end
Cathy, maybe you should
have spent the money

01:19:47.616 --> 01:19:49.684 line:95%,end
on more lessons
instead of improving the studio.

01:19:49.751 --> 01:19:51.186 line:95%,end
- CATHY: Bye!
- Or maybe a little--

01:19:51.253 --> 01:19:53.488 line:95%,end
Thank you.
Always a pleasure!

01:19:54.990 --> 01:19:56.391 line:95%,end
[cheering]

01:19:57.092 --> 01:19:58.493 line:95%,end
[laughter]

01:19:58.560 --> 01:19:59.928 line:95%,end
Woo-hoo!

01:19:59.995 --> 01:20:02.030 line:95%,end
MELISSA: I feel like we should hug, too.

01:20:02.097 --> 01:20:04.232 line:95%,end
- JILL: So?
- CHRISTI: I have one thing to say!

01:20:04.299 --> 01:20:06.434 line:95%,end
JILL: Go for it.
Ding, dong, the witch is dead!

01:20:06.501 --> 01:20:08.503 line:95%,end
I think those are pallbearers out there.

01:20:08.570 --> 01:20:09.738 line:95%,end
They're not bodyguards.

01:20:09.805 --> 01:20:12.007 line:95%,end
They're carrying
their casket down the hallway.

01:20:12.073 --> 01:20:13.275 line:95%,end
[laughs]

01:20:14.009 --> 01:20:16.478 line:95%,end
Kendall, you were told to use your face.

01:20:16.545 --> 01:20:19.181 line:95%,end
You used your face.
That was your lesson this week.

01:20:19.247 --> 01:20:20.982 line:95%,end
You did it, and look where you were.

01:20:21.850 --> 01:20:25.287 line:95%,end
Maddie, you finally
climbed that uphill battle.

01:20:25.353 --> 01:20:26.888 line:95%,end
You knocked down the wall.

01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:30.692 line:95%,end
First overall high score--
deservedly so.

01:20:30.759 --> 01:20:33.295 line:95%,end
You were-- I thought
you were brilliant today.

01:20:33.895 --> 01:20:35.897 line:95%,end
All right.
How about my duet?

01:20:35.964 --> 01:20:37.465 line:95%,end
- Woo!
- Woo-hoo.

01:20:37.532 --> 01:20:40.168 line:95%,end
- I told you we could do it.
- Yes.

01:20:40.235 --> 01:20:42.370 line:95%,end
You were pretty sassy up there.

01:20:42.437 --> 01:20:44.773 line:95%,end
What about the group?

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:46.641 line:95%,end
- [cheering]
- Woo!

01:20:46.708 --> 01:20:50.946 line:95%,end
Brooke, were you just waiting
at the bus stop for the bus?

01:20:52.414 --> 01:20:53.782 line:95%,end
[laughs]

01:20:54.015 --> 01:20:55.884 line:95%,end
What-- I don't know
what happened out there.

01:20:55.951 --> 01:20:58.453 line:95%,end
But the bus was moving,
the bus was happening,

01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:00.589 line:95%,end
and Brooke was just kind
of standing at the bus stop,

01:21:00.655 --> 01:21:02.624 line:95%,end
waiting for everybody to get on the bus.

01:21:02.691 --> 01:21:03.892 line:95%,end
[laughter]

01:21:03.959 --> 01:21:06.294 line:95%,end
- MELISSA: What did she do?
- CHRISTI: Nothing. That's the problem.

01:21:06.361 --> 01:21:08.830 line:95%,end
- MELISSA: I didn't want--
- CHRISTI: (LAUGHING) She stood there.

01:21:08.897 --> 01:21:10.966 line:95%,end
Well, I just want you to know
that I think that Rosa Parks

01:21:11.032 --> 01:21:12.334 line:95%,end
would be very proud of you.

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:13.735 line:95%,end
- [laughs] Thank you.
- OK?

01:21:13.802 --> 01:21:14.903 line:95%,end
You did a great job, great job.

01:21:14.970 --> 01:21:16.204 line:95%,end
Thank you for giving her an opportunity.

01:21:16.271 --> 01:21:17.973 line:95%,end
You were a big distraction
from the bus stop here.

01:21:18.039 --> 01:21:19.207 line:95%,end
[laughter]

01:21:19.274 --> 01:21:20.876 line:95%,end
I'm patting myself on the back,

01:21:20.942 --> 01:21:23.311 line:95%,end
because I did an outstanding job
with the costuming.

01:21:23.378 --> 01:21:24.846 line:95%,end
I knew we were coming to Ohio.

01:21:24.913 --> 01:21:26.281 line:95%,end
I knew she was going to be here.

01:21:26.348 --> 01:21:30.552 line:95%,end
And I just felt like
I needed to pull out the stops,

01:21:30.619 --> 01:21:34.089 line:95%,end
because I was never going
to let her get the best of us again.

01:21:34.155 --> 01:21:35.323 line:95%,end
I'm just not going to do it.

01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:38.727 line:95%,end
Cathy's mishmash applesauce is no match

01:21:38.793 --> 01:21:42.163 line:95%,end
for a fully-functioning ALDC.

01:21:42.230 --> 01:21:45.400 line:95%,end
When we're on, we're unstoppable.

01:21:45.467 --> 01:21:48.536 line:95%,end
Cathy's crazy.
I mean, all the money she spends,

01:21:48.603 --> 01:21:50.939 line:95%,end
all the money flying
these boys in,

01:21:51.006 --> 01:21:53.575 line:95%,end
the same thing with the choreographer--
blah, blah, blah--

01:21:53.642 --> 01:21:55.176 line:95%,end
money can't buy talent.

01:21:56.778 --> 01:21:59.714 line:95%,end
Moms? Moms?
I want positive energy.

01:21:59.781 --> 01:22:01.616 line:95%,end
If you're gonna badmouth me
in your house,

01:22:01.683 --> 01:22:03.184 line:95%,end
wait till your kid goes to sleep!

01:22:07.255 --> 01:22:09.357 line:5%,start
Mackenzie, you are not in the group dance.

01:22:09.424 --> 01:22:11.192 line:5%,start
Frankly, I don't think you can keep up.

01:22:11.259 --> 01:22:14.396 line:5%,start
If the group dance messes up,
it's on Mackenzie.

01:22:14.462 --> 01:22:15.931 line:5%,start
What you got on your finger there?

01:22:16.564 --> 01:22:18.366 line:5%,start
- Wait, what?
- He what?

01:22:19.301 --> 01:22:22.404 line:5%,start
This is what she does to you every week,
and you let her psych you out.

01:22:22.470 --> 01:22:24.973 line:5%,start
[dramatic music]

01:22:25.707 --> 01:22:27.142 line:5%,start
What was that exit about?

01:22:29.044 --> 01:22:30.679 line:5%,start
JILL: This is your team.
These are your girls.

01:22:30.745 --> 01:22:32.314 line:5%,start
This is your name on their back.

01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:34.616 line:5%,start
So you have to give them some sort of--

01:22:34.983 --> 01:22:36.084 line:5%,start
I'm really nervous.
