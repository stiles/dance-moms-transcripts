Previously on "Dance Moms."

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:06.806 line:5%,start
This week, you will be performing
in the annual dance concert.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.109 line:5%,start
Are we doing a new number,
or are you not?

00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:11.745 line:5%,start
I'm going to call Kelly and see
if she's planning on coming.

00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:14.514 line:5%,start
Do you think Christi and Kelly
are going to make your kid a star?

Shush the beak.

Stop it. Since when does your
ass go on my stage.

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:23.089 line:5%,start
Never in 40 years of being
in the Abby Lee Dance Company

00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:27.660 line:5%,start
has anyone been given a solo
the day of the [bleep] recital!

00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:28.828 line:5%,start
You're out. You're out.

00:00:28.895 --> 00:00:29.896 line:5%,start
KELLY: Good!
- Call the police.

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:31.031 line:5%,start

Coming up on "Dance Moms."

The Wicked Witch from
the West will be there.

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:41.841 line:5%,start
All of you have come highly recommended.

How's it going?

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:46.012 line:5%,start
You sit here and say
that is not your seat,

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.682 line:5%,start
I want Kelly back, when she constantly
runs out on this team with her children!

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:51.051 line:5%,start
Hey, how about you take a seat--

00:00:51.117 --> 00:00:53.019 line:5%,start
CATHY: I don't need to take a seat.
---and enjoy the show.

00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:54.320 line:5%,start
ABBY LEE: She's lucky
I even know her name.

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:56.790 line:5%,start
-I didn't--
-So shut your mouth!

00:00:56.856 --> 00:01:01.494 line:5%,start
No, stop! This is about dance!

Come on.

00:01:23.116 --> 00:01:24.551 line:5%,start

JILL [VOICEOVER]: I miss
Kelly like the rest of us,

00:01:26.786 --> 00:01:30.390 line:5%,start
but reality is Kelly pulled
her kids from the recital,

00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:33.426 line:5%,start
and we don't know
if she's coming back or not.

00:01:33.593 --> 00:01:35.061 line:95%,end
Well, congratulations.

00:01:35.128 --> 00:01:37.664 line:95%,end
The annual dance concert is over.

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:40.200 line:95%,end
The show went off without a hitch.

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:41.835 line:95%,end
Let's get to the pyramid.

00:01:41.968 --> 00:01:45.171 line:95%,end
First, I have Paige.

00:01:45.238 --> 00:01:46.973 line:95%,end
Paige wasn't there.

00:01:47.207 --> 00:01:49.976 line:95%,end
Paige was given the
opportunity to do a new solo--

00:01:50.376 --> 00:01:52.245 line:95%,end
very unprofessional.

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:56.149 line:95%,end
Next, we have Brooke.

00:01:56.449 --> 00:02:00.386 line:95%,end
She could have sang "Summer Love Song"
in my show for the finale.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.624 line:95%,end
I single-handedly was
giving her the opportunity

00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:08.561 line:95%,end
to resurrect that old song
and get a lot more mileage out of it.

00:02:08.628 --> 00:02:11.064 line:5%,start
It's one thing for Kelly to let me down--

00:02:11.464 --> 00:02:13.032 line:5%,start
she does it all the time--

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:16.269 line:95%,end
but it's another thing for her
to let her own children down.

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:17.770 line:95%,end
And that's exactly what she did.

00:02:17.937 --> 00:02:20.039 line:5%,start
Next, we have Asia.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.077 line:5%,start
Asia, you did an outstanding
job with the solo.

00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:29.782 line:5%,start
ABBY LEE: You do all these
really exciting tricks--

00:02:30.116 --> 00:02:32.051 line:5%,start
grab your leg, spin around three times--

00:02:32.552 --> 00:02:33.887 line:5%,start

[salsa music]

00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:44.197 line:95%,end
Kristie, you're a dance mom.
You know better.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.965 line:95%,end
I do.

00:02:46.032 --> 00:02:48.067 line:95%,end
Next, I have Nia.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.805 line:95%,end
Nia, what can you do
better than everybody else?

00:02:52.972 --> 00:02:57.410 line:95%,end
It's good. It's fine.
But it's not excellence.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.079 line:95%,end
If you were to give her
probably a little bit more

00:03:00.146 --> 00:03:02.048 line:95%,end
of your time and attention one-on-one,

00:03:02.148 --> 00:03:05.818 line:95%,end
I think she could prove
to you that she is a great

00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:06.953 line:95%,end
and talented dancer.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.488 line:5%,start
I'm really getting sick and tired of Abby

00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:10.890 line:5%,start
saying that Nia's not as good
as the rest of the girls.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.593 line:95%,end
All the other girls have
opportunities to do solos,

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.097 line:95%,end
duos, trios, and get that extra time
with Abby to learn from her.

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:20.600 line:95%,end
Nia hasn't had any of
that in over six months,

00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:23.670 line:95%,end
and that's why the girls are
perceived to be "excellent."

00:03:23.803 --> 00:03:26.906 line:95%,end
All right, moving on up, Mackenzie.

00:03:27.006 --> 00:03:32.111 line:95%,end
Sandra from "Dance Track Magazine"
said that you were a fantastic nerd.

00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:33.413 line:5%,start
SANDRA: That's pretty.

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:37.183 line:95%,end
You just didn't know enough
nerd moves or nerd poses.

00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:40.687 line:5%,start
And next, we have Maddie.

00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:43.957 line:5%,start
You had the opportunity
to do a new routine.

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:47.193 line:5%,start
I had to put my hand up for you.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.762 line:5%,start
Paige would prefer not to do a new solo.

00:03:49.862 --> 00:03:51.397 line:95%,end
I'm offering it to somebody else.

00:03:51.497 --> 00:03:53.266 line:95%,end
Maddie, you have your survivor number?

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:55.568 line:95%,end
She did not volunteer.
You volunteered her.

00:03:55.635 --> 00:03:57.136 line:95%,end
That can't happen.


00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:58.371 line:95%,end
If you're going to act like that,

00:03:58.538 --> 00:04:00.206 line:95%,end
I'm going to pass you up
and give those opportunities

00:04:00.273 --> 00:04:01.307 line:95%,end
to other people.

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:03.943 line:5%,start
And next...

00:04:09.115 --> 00:04:10.149 line:95%,end
...we have Chloe.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.320 line:95%,end
You would have to be the MVP of the show.

00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:16.623 line:95%,end
She knew Paige's choreography.

00:04:16.723 --> 00:04:17.991 line:95%,end
She just did it.

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:20.093 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:04:22.362 --> 00:04:24.330 line:5%,start
Now, Christi, I'm looking
at your body language,

00:04:24.397 --> 00:04:26.366 line:95%,end
and you're not thrilled
that she's this high.

00:04:26.432 --> 00:04:28.835 line:95%,end
I'm thrilled that she's
second on the pyramid.

00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:29.936 line:5%,start
Of course, I am.

00:04:30.003 --> 00:04:33.473 line:5%,start
If you think Chloe was the MVP
and the hero of the recital,

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:36.142 line:95%,end
why don't you give her the
top spot in the pyramid?

00:04:36.242 --> 00:04:38.978 line:95%,end
And now on the top of our pyramid

00:04:39.045 --> 00:04:42.715 line:95%,end
is none other than our "Dance
Track Magazine" cover girl,

00:04:43.049 --> 00:04:44.050 line:5%,start
Miss Kendall.

00:04:44.217 --> 00:04:45.218 line:5%,start
[applause]

00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:46.653 line:95%,end
Woo-hoo!

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:51.658 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: Kendall was
looking into that camera

00:04:51.724 --> 00:04:54.027 line:95%,end
like you were looking
at another mean girl.

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:57.497 line:95%,end
Kendall and I worked
so hard at getting her

00:04:57.597 --> 00:05:00.300 line:95%,end
to the top of that
pyramid through hard work

00:05:00.366 --> 00:05:01.701 line:95%,end
and perseverance.

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:05.772 line:95%,end
And the fact that she is
on top is amazing to me.

00:05:06.005 --> 00:05:08.141 line:95%,end
All of her hard work is paying off.

00:05:08.408 --> 00:05:13.212 line:95%,end
This week, we will be attending Believe
in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:14.947 line:95%,end
This is going to be a biggie.

00:05:15.081 --> 00:05:17.417 line:95%,end
It's exciting to go to a
new competition this week.

00:05:17.483 --> 00:05:19.519 line:95%,end
Believe is a prestigious competition,

00:05:19.585 --> 00:05:22.655 line:95%,end
so that means Abby is going
to be that much more difficult

00:05:22.722 --> 00:05:25.024 line:95%,end
and harder on the girls,
because she's going to expect nothing

00:05:25.124 --> 00:05:26.225 line:95%,end
but the best.

00:05:26.292 --> 00:05:27.994 line:95%,end
You are all in the group routine,

00:05:28.561 --> 00:05:31.564 line:95%,end
And the name is "Open Waters."

00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:35.168 line:95%,end
You better be the sharks
in those open waters.

00:05:35.568 --> 00:05:38.671 line:95%,end
Moms, the Wicked Witch will be there.

MELISSA [VOICEOVER]:
When I hear Candy Apples,

00:05:41.207 --> 00:05:44.010 line:5%,start
the hair on my neck stands up,
because Abby turns

00:05:44.077 --> 00:05:45.878 line:95%,end
into a totally different person.

00:05:45.945 --> 00:05:48.014 line:95%,end
The closer we get to the competition,

00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:49.582 line:95%,end
the more stressed out she gets.

00:05:49.682 --> 00:05:54.854 line:95%,end
Now, I also found out
that she is doing a trio,

00:05:54.954 --> 00:05:57.390 line:95%,end
so that means we're going to do a trio.

00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:00.660 line:95%,end
Chloe, Kendall...

00:06:02.628 --> 00:06:04.464 line:95%,end
...and I was
going to choose Maddie,

00:06:05.765 --> 00:06:07.867 line:95%,end
but I think I'm going to use Nia.

00:06:07.934 --> 00:06:09.736 line:95%,end

00:06:11.337 --> 00:06:12.638 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE [VOICEOVER]: Sorry, Maddie.

00:06:12.705 --> 00:06:15.007 line:95%,end
You obviously don't care
about being featured.

00:06:15.074 --> 00:06:17.543 line:95%,end
If you did, you would
have raised your hand like

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.047 line:95%,end

a replacement for the dance concert.

Understand?
- Yes.

00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:29.255 line:5%,start

Guys, did you warm up?
Good.

00:06:41.667 --> 00:06:43.603 line:95%,end
And I see that we're
starting into choreography,

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:44.670 line:95%,end
so that's awesome.

it's going to happen.

we really want this spot.

00:20:33.265 --> 00:20:35.133 line:95%,end
I don't want this just to
be another fill-in week.

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.069 line:95%,end
Everybody has to think of the real reason

00:20:37.135 --> 00:20:39.071 line:95%,end
why we're sitting here in the first place.

00:20:39.137 --> 00:20:42.007 line:95%,end
It's to get our child ahead in dance.

00:20:42.074 --> 00:20:43.976 line:95%,end
CHRISTI: Well, Candy
Apples has a lot of teams.

00:20:44.076 --> 00:20:45.244 line:95%,end
Maybe you need to go there.

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:48.113 line:95%,end
JILL: Cathy is trying so hard to come up

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:50.515 line:95%,end
with a group of kids that
can beat our group of kids.

00:20:50.582 --> 00:20:53.051 line:95%,end
Her boys didn't work out,
so she gets rid of the boys.

00:20:53.118 --> 00:20:54.519 line:95%,end
She brings in a new group.

00:20:54.586 --> 00:20:56.154 line:5%,start
What kind of teacher is that?

00:20:56.221 --> 00:20:58.557 line:5%,start
I am so sick of Cathy's tricks.

00:20:58.624 --> 00:21:02.427 line:5%,start
I want to make sure that us
moms stick together this week,


00:21:02.494 --> 00:21:05.097 line:95%,end
and we hand that crab apple a loss.

00:21:05.163 --> 00:21:06.164 line:95%,end
Are we sticking together?

00:21:06.231 --> 00:21:09.301 line:95%,end
Because, you know, once
we get there, Cathy's--

00:21:09.368 --> 00:21:12.271 line:95%,end
they're going to come after us or me.

00:21:12.337 --> 00:21:13.338 line:95%,end
Now why are you saying this?

00:21:13.405 --> 00:21:15.173 line:95%,end
Have you guys not stuck
together in the past?

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.908 line:95%,end
Yes!
- No, we have.

00:21:16.975 --> 00:21:19.778 line:95%,end
I feel like I'm getting
ready to go, like, to battle.

00:21:19.845 --> 00:21:21.280 line:95%,end
You're our-- what did you call yourself?

00:21:21.613 --> 00:21:23.982 line:95%,end
The boy who fights in hockey?
- The goon.

00:21:24.082 --> 00:21:25.884 line:95%,end
[LAUGHING] The goon.
- I'm not the goon.

00:21:25.951 --> 00:21:27.552 line:95%,end
Maybe Leslie has a purpose after all.

00:21:27.786 --> 00:21:29.788 line:95%,end
I could get used to her going
in as the muscle to fight

00:21:29.855 --> 00:21:30.956 line:5%,start
with Cathy this weekend.

00:21:31.023 --> 00:21:32.024 line:5%,start
LESLIE: Morning.
HOLLY: Hi, good morning.

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:33.158 line:5%,start
JILL: Good morning.

00:21:33.258 --> 00:21:34.259 line:95%,end
Good afternoon.

00:21:34.826 --> 00:21:36.161 line:95%,end
New face, how are you?

00:21:36.261 --> 00:21:37.462 line:95%,end
I'm good.
Good.

00:21:37.529 --> 00:21:39.197 line:95%,end
Finally getting to sit in Kelly's seat?

00:21:39.264 --> 00:21:42.167 line:95%,end
I just want to let you know
that she is really enjoying

00:21:42.234 --> 00:21:44.903 line:95%,end
this, and we are going to take every
opportunity that comes our way.

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:46.204 line:95%,end
And that's why we are here.

00:21:46.305 --> 00:21:48.640 line:95%,end
Payton has the energy.
Payton has the desire.

00:21:48.707 --> 00:21:51.977 line:95%,end
She wants to do it. She wants
to be the best. She wants this.

00:21:52.044 --> 00:21:55.547 line:95%,end
But for this routine that
we're doing right now,

00:21:55.614 --> 00:22:00.552 line:95%,end
when I envisioned this number,
I had Brooke on that prop,

00:22:01.086 --> 00:22:04.089 line:95%,end
and she could do all
that contortion work,

00:22:04.156 --> 00:22:05.190 line:95%,end
that rolling around on the floor.

00:22:05.257 --> 00:22:07.492 line:95%,end
All of that was supposed
to take place on that prop.

00:22:07.559 --> 00:22:09.061 line:95%,end
Payton doesn't have those skills.

00:22:09.127 --> 00:22:10.462 line:95%,end
She has other skills.

00:22:10.562 --> 00:22:13.365 line:95%,end
I hate to say it, Leslie,
but we told you so.

00:22:13.432 --> 00:22:16.735 line:95%,end
Brooke just has a certain skill set
that's difficult for Abby to replace.

00:22:16.802 --> 00:22:19.171 line:95%,end
Do you know how hard it is
when you don't-- when she gets

00:22:19.237 --> 00:22:20.906 line:95%,end
kicked off this team every time?

00:22:20.972 --> 00:22:22.407 line:95%,end
It's not about being kicked off the team.

00:22:22.474 --> 00:22:24.309 line:95%,end
It's about not being right
for the piece that we're doing.

00:22:24.376 --> 00:22:25.410 line:95%,end
But it still feels that way to--

00:22:25.477 --> 00:22:26.478 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: Right.
Well--

00:22:26.545 --> 00:22:27.546 line:95%,end
--a 14, 15-year-old.

00:22:27.612 --> 00:22:29.481 line:95%,end
So every time I explain
to her, but you still

00:22:29.548 --> 00:22:31.249 line:95%,end
have to be there when she asks you back

00:22:31.316 --> 00:22:33.418 line:95%,end
and we are going to keep doing that,
we don't want that.

00:22:33.485 --> 00:22:35.020 line:95%,end
We want to be a permanent spot.

00:22:35.287 --> 00:22:37.422 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE [VOICEOVER]:
Leslie is in my face about Payton

00:22:37.522 --> 00:22:40.258 line:95%,end
being on the team and being a permanent
member and blah, blah, blah.

00:22:40.325 --> 00:22:41.526 line:95%,end
You know what, Leslie?

00:22:41.593 --> 00:22:44.830 line:95%,end
You are not making a very
good case for Payton's future.

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:46.565 line:95%,end
[exhales]

00:22:47.132 --> 00:22:50.168 line:95%,end
I want to remind you what this
competition means to everybody

00:22:50.235 --> 00:22:51.570 line:95%,end
and what's at stake.

00:22:51.636 --> 00:22:53.238 line:95%,end
Lots of things are at stake at this one.

00:22:53.305 --> 00:22:54.439 line:95%,end
I want to win.

00:22:54.506 --> 00:22:55.941 line:95%,end
CATHY [VOICEOVER]: Everybody needs

00:22:56.041 --> 00:22:58.343 line:95%,end
to bring it to the table this
weekend at the competition.

00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:00.545 line:95%,end
CATHY: Moms, Anthony
has requested that you

00:23:00.612 --> 00:23:02.614 line:95%,end
keep your chatter to a minimum.

00:23:02.681 --> 00:23:06.051 line:95%,end
And Anthony is going to keep his
bold corrections to a minimum.

00:23:06.351 --> 00:23:07.619 line:95%,end
Who said that?
- I did.

00:23:09.354 --> 00:23:15.060 line:5%,start
CATHY [VOICEOVER]: This trio is parody
on those moms trying to be spies.

00:23:15.127 --> 00:23:19.631 line:95%,end
So we've got a spy musical theater jazz
routine going to the stage.

00:23:20.732 --> 00:23:22.567 line:95%,end
ANTHONY: Watch your face. [CLAPPING]
Why am I seeing your face?

00:23:22.634 --> 00:23:23.735 line:95%,end
Why am I seeing your face?

00:23:23.802 --> 00:23:26.738 line:95%,end
I don't want to see your face
until you put the newspaper down.

00:23:28.306 --> 00:23:29.307 line:95%,end
Go back.

00:23:29.374 --> 00:23:32.010 line:95%,end
CATHY: Do you think that your
bark is worse than your bite?

00:23:33.278 --> 00:23:35.213 line:95%,end
ANTHONY: I don't bite.
CATHY: You bark though.

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:38.683 line:95%,end
ANTHONY: I bark.
Bigger lean-- sharper, sharper.

00:23:39.284 --> 00:23:40.285 line:95%,end
Bop, bop, lay.

00:23:40.952 --> 00:23:43.655 line:95%,end
Did you change that part where
they were all going the same way?

00:23:43.722 --> 00:23:46.258 line:95%,end
ANTHONY: Yeah, I did, because
Brooke couldn't get it.

00:23:46.925 --> 00:23:47.926 line:5%,start
Because Brooke couldn't get it?

00:23:50.562 --> 00:23:52.497 line:95%,end
ANTHONY: I'm talking about her
not getting her choreography.

00:23:52.597 --> 00:23:53.965 line:5%,start
That's what I'm talking about.
MICHELLE: Really?

00:23:54.933 --> 00:23:56.701 line:5%,start
Whatever I took out.
And it's done, so quiet.

00:23:58.336 --> 00:23:59.337 line:5%,start
CATHY: Anthony--

00:24:00.372 --> 00:24:02.741 line:95%,end
CATHY [VOICEOVER]: I am tired
of fighting with Anthony.

00:24:02.974 --> 00:24:06.077 line:95%,end
He needs to remember who signs his checks.

00:24:06.144 --> 00:24:10.682 line:95%,end
Honestly, I think that Anthony likes
to perform when you get in here.

00:24:10.949 --> 00:24:13.185 line:95%,end
So just know that I have--
ANTHONY: No.

00:24:13.285 --> 00:24:14.286 line:95%,end
--the kids' best interest at heart.

00:24:14.352 --> 00:24:15.487 line:95%,end
ANTHONY: Yeah, 'cause
I'm a true performer.

00:24:15.554 --> 00:24:16.688 line:95%,end
Hey, how about you take a seat--

00:24:16.755 --> 00:24:17.756 line:95%,end
CATHY: I don't need to take a seat.

00:24:17.823 --> 00:24:19.291 line:95%,end
ANTHONY: --and enjoy the show.
- I don't need to take a seat.

00:24:19.357 --> 00:24:20.525 line:95%,end
ANTHONY: You take a seat
and enjoy the real show.

00:24:21.259 --> 00:24:23.428 line:95%,end
Listen, listen. I'm Miss Candy Apples,
and you are not.

00:24:23.495 --> 00:24:25.197 line:95%,end
ANTHONY: It sure can be ABD--
- So you always have to keep that in mind.

00:24:25.263 --> 00:24:27.199 line:95%,end
--Anthony Burrell Dance.
You better best believe.

00:24:27.265 --> 00:24:28.266 line:95%,end
CATHY: Yeah, okay.
- It can happen.

00:24:28.333 --> 00:24:30.202 line:95%,end
CATHY: Okay, okay.
- And I will have a squash of a team--

00:24:30.268 --> 00:24:31.269 line:95%,end
Okay, I hear ya.

00:24:31.336 --> 00:24:32.337 line:95%,end
--because half of this
team will be coming with me.

00:24:32.404 --> 00:24:33.405 line:95%,end
I hear ya.

CROWD: Cathy! Cathy! Cathy!

00:24:43.715 --> 00:24:45.016 line:5%,start
Cathy! Cathy!

00:24:45.083 --> 00:24:46.084 line:5%,start
Cathy!

00:24:46.485 --> 00:24:47.486 line:5%,start
Cathy! Cathy!

00:24:48.186 --> 00:24:50.589 line:5%,start
CATHY [VOICEOVER]: We're going
up against the Abby Lee Dance Company

00:24:50.655 --> 00:24:52.057 line:5%,start
here in Pennsylvania.

00:24:52.157 --> 00:24:54.626 line:5%,start
We have a group dance and a trio.

00:24:54.693 --> 00:24:57.295 line:95%,end
Anthony's mom is here, and my mom is here.

00:24:57.462 --> 00:24:59.831 line:95%,end
That sounds like an
unbeatable combination.

ABBY LEE [VOICEOVER]: Here
we are at Believe Talent Competition

00:25:07.706 --> 00:25:09.107 line:5%,start
in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

00:25:09.374 --> 00:25:12.310 line:5%,start
I think that our routines
are going to knock Cathy

00:25:12.377 --> 00:25:14.112 line:95%,end
right off that broomstick.

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:18.783 line:95%,end
And the Abby Lee Dance Company
is going to make a name for themselves

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:21.853 line:95%,end
at this brand-new Believe
Talent Competition.

00:25:23.688 --> 00:25:24.723 line:95%,end
Oh, this is great.

00:25:25.023 --> 00:25:28.059 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE [VOICEOVER]: This week, we also
have a tag-along, Leslie.

00:25:28.126 --> 00:25:30.996 line:95%,end
Now her daughter, Payton, is
a great addition to the team.

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:34.699 line:95%,end
Payton works well with the other kids,
and she looks great in this number.

00:25:34.766 --> 00:25:36.935 line:95%,end
I'm not so sure about her mother, Leslie,

00:25:37.002 --> 00:25:39.871 line:95%,end
but I do know she's a vast
improvement over Kelly.

00:25:41.506 --> 00:25:43.742 line:95%,end
So Leslie, let me just say,
Payton, that I'm

00:25:43.842 --> 00:25:45.010 line:95%,end
happy you're here, but I am--

00:25:45.076 --> 00:25:47.145 line:95%,end
Are you happier that
we're here and Kelly's not?

00:25:47.212 --> 00:25:48.580 line:95%,end
- Is that what you're trying to say?
- Well, I can't say happier. That--

00:25:48.647 --> 00:25:50.181 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: Oh, I am!
- That's not fair.

00:25:50.248 --> 00:25:52.450 line:95%,end
I'm hoping that you guys
get used to it being Payton

00:25:52.517 --> 00:25:54.619 line:95%,end
and I here and Kelly not coming back.

00:25:54.686 --> 00:25:56.187 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE: It's fine.
Listen to me, Kendall.

00:25:56.254 --> 00:25:57.255 line:95%,end
You know what, Payton?

00:25:57.322 --> 00:25:58.557 line:95%,end
Just so all of you
know, my name is Payton.

00:25:58.623 --> 00:26:01.359 line:95%,end
It's not Kendall. It's not Brooke.
It's none of you. It's Payton.

00:26:01.426 --> 00:26:02.694 line:95%,end
HOLLY: Yes, yes.

00:26:03.128 --> 00:26:04.763 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE [VOICEOVER]: Just
what she did right now, like,

00:26:04.829 --> 00:26:08.567 line:95%,end
saying her name like that,
that's a 15 going on 16-year-old thing.

00:26:08.934 --> 00:26:12.470 line:95%,end
You would never, ever hear
one of these kids talk to me that way.

00:26:12.571 --> 00:26:14.472 line:95%,end
- No, she wasn't talking to you.
- She just said that.

00:26:14.539 --> 00:26:16.474 line:95%,end
- That's a smart mouth.
- She wasn't being smart.

00:26:16.541 --> 00:26:19.377 line:95%,end
And as a parent, you should take her
outside and have a little chat.

00:26:19.511 --> 00:26:21.279 line:95%,end
No, you're missing what
she's trying to tell you.

00:26:21.346 --> 00:26:22.347 line:95%,end
She's trying to tell you--
ABBY LEE: No, because I kept--

00:26:22.414 --> 00:26:23.415 line:95%,end
--that she's a person!

00:26:23.481 --> 00:26:24.950 line:95%,end
--calling her Kendall
in rehearsal by mistake!

00:26:25.016 --> 00:26:26.251 line:95%,end
LESLIE: Confuse--
- I say lots of kids' names!

00:26:26.318 --> 00:26:27.652 line:95%,end
She's lucky I even know her name!

00:26:27.719 --> 00:26:29.721 line:95%,end
LESLIE: I didn't--
- So shut your mouth!

00:26:30.589 --> 00:26:33.124 line:95%,end
I'm going to ask you a question
right now, Miss Payton.

00:26:33.191 --> 00:26:36.928 line:95%,end
And if you answer me yes, then you're--

00:26:36.995 --> 00:26:39.531 line:95%,end
LESLIE: Don't answer.
--where you should be at 15 years old.

00:26:39.598 --> 00:26:41.499 line:95%,end
Do you have your solo costume with you?

00:26:42.167 --> 00:26:43.168 line:95%,end
No?

00:26:43.501 --> 00:26:45.670 line:95%,end
Then keep the smart mouth to yourself,

00:26:45.737 --> 00:26:48.106 line:95%,end
