00:08:20.533 --> 00:08:22.068 line:95%,end
Oh, OK.

00:08:22.134 --> 00:08:23.336 line:95%,end
Yes.

00:08:23.402 --> 00:08:28.474 line:95%,end
Now, the question is,
why did you become a dance teacher

00:08:28.541 --> 00:08:30.543 line:95%,end
instead of just a performer?

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:34.614 line:95%,end
Well, in my high school days
I danced for the USO.

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:38.150 line:95%,end
I come home and told my dad that,
and he said, "You're not doing it.

00:08:38.217 --> 00:08:40.953 line:95%,end
I'm not allowing that.
It's not right."

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:46.459 line:95%,end
And I said, "Well, if I cannot dance,
I will teach people to do that."

00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:48.661 line:95%,end
And now that legacy lives on.

00:08:48.728 --> 00:08:49.862 line:95%,end
Right.

00:08:49.929 --> 00:08:53.699 line:95%,end
Because moms are in a way my specialty.

00:08:53.766 --> 00:08:57.303 line:95%,end
I have to also mention
the not-so-fabulous moms,

00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:02.408 line:95%,end
or should I just say rude,
distasteful, and ugly.

00:09:02.742 --> 00:09:05.011 line:95%,end
I can't believe you guys
wouldn't back me up on this.

00:09:05.077 --> 00:09:07.613 line:95%,end
Because we're following the rules.
You're not.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.482 line:95%,end
She's going out there
in the gymnasium

00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:11.117 line:95%,end
in her costume
that I brought for her.

00:09:11.183 --> 00:09:12.985 line:95%,end
- You're looking me in the eye.
- MELISSA: This is her costume.

00:09:13.052 --> 00:09:15.288 line:95%,end
Has she ever worn that costume
in a competition, or a stage,

00:09:15.354 --> 00:09:17.490 line:95%,end
or a show, or a showcase,

00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:19.992 line:95%,end
or a performance, or a school gig,
or anything else?

00:09:20.059 --> 00:09:23.129 line:95%,end
Yes, but you haven't seen her in it.
None of you have seen her in it.

00:09:23.195 --> 00:09:25.131 line:95%,end
I don't care if somebody
else in the world did.

00:09:25.197 --> 00:09:26.265 line:95%,end
What are you doing?

00:09:26.332 --> 00:09:28.634 line:95%,end
I'm leaving.
You don't want me here.

00:09:28.701 --> 00:09:30.369 line:95%,end
- I'll just make it easier for you.
- MOM: No. We want you here.

00:09:30.436 --> 00:09:31.871 line:95%,end
We want you to play by the rules.

00:09:31.938 --> 00:09:33.773 line:95%,end
- The reason-- Jill.
- Whatever. Whatever.

00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:35.975 line:95%,end
I'll pack my bags
and go home right now.

00:09:36.042 --> 00:09:38.778 line:95%,end
Is that-- would that make
you guys all really happy?

00:09:38.844 --> 00:09:41.113 line:95%,end
- No, that would not make me happy.
- Because that's what I'm doing.

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.149 line:95%,end
- And you know who's going to lose?
- I'm sick of this [BLEEP].

00:09:43.215 --> 00:09:45.184 line:95%,end
- It's going to be--
- Done.

00:09:45.251 --> 00:09:46.452 line:95%,end
It's going
to be your daughter that loses out.

00:09:46.519 --> 00:09:47.653 line:95%,end
- It's your daughter.
- Good for you.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.589 line:95%,end
Jill's throwing shoes, and she's cursing.

00:09:49.655 --> 00:09:51.791 line:95%,end
And all I'm thinking is,
you are so hard to take seriously

00:09:51.857 --> 00:09:53.125 line:95%,end
wearing that hat.

00:09:53.225 --> 00:09:55.394 line:95%,end
Yeah, you know what?
You're exactly right.

00:09:55.461 --> 00:09:56.963 line:95%,end
It's supposed to be about the kids.

00:09:57.029 --> 00:09:59.799 line:95%,end
Let her wear the [BLEEP] damn costume.

00:10:01.701 --> 00:10:04.036 line:95%,end
ABBY: Some might say
Jill was passionate.

00:10:04.103 --> 00:10:06.072 line:95%,end
Really?
She threw a shoe at me.

00:10:06.138 --> 00:10:07.907 line:95%,end
I think she's just rude.

00:10:07.974 --> 00:10:09.742 line:95%,end
That was bad behavior.

00:10:09.809 --> 00:10:11.777 line:95%,end
What kind of mother is that?


00:10:12.845 --> 00:10:14.547 line:95%,end
ABBY: Happy
Mother's Day, everybody.

00:10:14.614 --> 00:10:16.849 line:5%,start
I wanted to share this day with my mom

00:10:16.916 --> 00:10:20.620 line:5%,start
because it's a very important time
in our lives.

00:10:20.686 --> 00:10:23.589 line:95%,end
And I also want her
to know that I'm not tough

00:10:23.656 --> 00:10:25.925 line:95%,end
and mean all the time.

00:10:26.359 --> 00:10:30.529 line:95%,end
My mother showered her students
with love and kindness.

00:10:30.596 --> 00:10:32.698 line:95%,end
She's a very giving woman.

00:10:32.765 --> 00:10:36.002 line:95%,end
And I think I picked up
a few of those qualities too.

00:10:36.068 --> 00:10:39.071 line:95%,end
- What do you think this spoon is for?
- ALL: Ice cream!

00:10:39.138 --> 00:10:40.172 line:95%,end
Are we right?

00:10:40.239 --> 00:10:41.440 line:95%,end
Yes, for ice cream.

00:10:41.507 --> 00:10:42.808 line:95%,end
- We're having a treat.
- BOTH: Yes!

00:10:42.875 --> 00:10:44.644 line:95%,end
- A treat.
- Cheers.

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:47.413 line:95%,end
- [CLINKING]
- Can we get some service here?

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.583 line:95%,end
My God.
Oh, my God.

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.718 line:5%,start
I love ice cream.

00:10:52.785 --> 00:10:54.520 line:95%,end
No!
Give it to me.

00:10:54.587 --> 00:10:56.022 line:95%,end
You have ice cream right there.

00:10:56.088 --> 00:10:58.791 line:95%,end
Right...there.

00:10:58.858 --> 00:10:59.992 line:95%,end
GIRL: [LAUGHS]

00:11:00.226 --> 00:11:01.460 line:95%,end
Ice cream--

00:11:01.527 --> 00:11:04.263 line:95%,end
I definitely inherited
my sweet tooth from my mom.

00:11:04.597 --> 00:11:07.333 line:95%,end
Now, even though
our teaching styles are very different,

00:11:07.767 --> 00:11:10.202 line:95%,end
she'll never know
how much she influenced

00:11:10.269 --> 00:11:14.073 line:95%,end
my creative decisions,
my music selections,

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:16.475 line:95%,end
and the way I design a costume.

00:11:16.942 --> 00:11:20.813 line:95%,end
Now, there's one big issue
that my mom and I differed on,

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.315 line:95%,end
and that was a pet.

00:11:23.816 --> 00:11:27.153 line:95%,end
Every single birthday list
and every single Christmas list

00:11:27.219 --> 00:11:30.823 line:95%,end
started out, number one, dog.

00:11:31.357 --> 00:11:33.526 line:95%,end
I wanted a dog my entire life.

00:11:34.026 --> 00:11:38.197 line:95%,end
So when I turned 30,
I went out and I bought myself a dog.

00:11:38.264 --> 00:11:41.600 line:95%,end
Broadway Baby
was my best friend for 16 years.

00:11:41.667 --> 00:11:45.204 line:95%,end
Hello, hello!

00:11:45.271 --> 00:11:47.206 line:95%,end
Broadway Baby is my dog.

00:11:47.273 --> 00:11:48.474 line:95%,end
Yes, there we go.

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:50.009 line:95%,end
Good girl.

00:11:50.076 --> 00:11:53.079 line:95%,end
She is the best thing in my life.

00:11:53.145 --> 00:11:54.880 line:95%,end
She doesn't roll her eyes at me.

00:11:54.947 --> 00:11:58.551 line:95%,end
She is wonderful, absolutely wonderful.

00:11:58.617 --> 00:12:01.387 line:95%,end
All the way around, go.
That's fine.

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:07.860 line:95%,end
I might tell the girls
to save their tears for the pillow,

00:12:08.527 --> 00:12:10.830 line:95%,end
but I save mine for my mom.

00:12:11.063 --> 00:12:14.266 line:95%,end
[GUITAR MUSIC]

00:12:15.234 --> 00:12:18.003 line:95%,end
You were so cute and never hurt anybody.

00:12:19.171 --> 00:12:20.740 line:95%,end
She made everybody smile.

[SNIFFS]

00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:25.010 line:95%,end
And what if something was wrong

00:12:25.077 --> 00:12:26.812 line:95%,end
and I could have done something about it?

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.949 line:95%,end
I think maybe it was her time to go.

00:12:30.015 --> 00:12:33.953 line:95%,end
She just-- I mean, she got sick in a day.

00:12:34.019 --> 00:12:35.521 line:95%,end
It was that quick.

00:12:35.588 --> 00:12:38.457 line:5%,start
I know.
She kept me sane.

00:12:38.691 --> 00:12:42.128 line:5%,start
She made everything OK.

00:12:42.194 --> 00:12:45.998 line:95%,end
When I would come home
from work upset or distraught

00:12:46.065 --> 00:12:47.700 line:95%,end
over the mothers, or, you know, you just

00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:50.069 line:95%,end
have a rough day at work,
and you come home,

00:12:50.136 --> 00:12:53.706 line:95%,end
and they kiss you, and they lick you,
and that you're just--

00:12:57.109 --> 00:12:59.311 line:95%,end
I wasn't here when she needed me.

00:12:59.378 --> 00:13:02.114 line:95%,end
I was with somebody else's kids.

00:13:02.548 --> 00:13:05.551 line:95%,end
Mom, I know you don't always agree
with my decisions.

00:13:05.618 --> 00:13:07.219 line:95%,end
- Or my teaching methods.
- Mm-hmm.

00:13:07.286 --> 00:13:08.754 line:95%,end
But I just want you to know

00:13:09.054 --> 00:13:12.291 line:95%,end
that everything I learned
about designing costumes,

00:13:12.725 --> 00:13:17.930 line:95%,end
and selecting music,
and working with children

00:13:17.997 --> 00:13:19.865 line:95%,end
- I learned from you.
- Hmm.

00:13:20.432 --> 00:13:24.069 line:95%,end
I mean, I've never heard
you say that before.

00:13:24.136 --> 00:13:27.139 line:95%,end
I know that I was
more of a daddy's girl, right?

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:32.011 line:95%,end
He told me that
you dropped me off the kitchen table.

00:13:32.077 --> 00:13:33.212 line:95%,end
Oh, God.

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:35.748 line:95%,end
- Is that true?
- Yeah.

00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:40.119 line:95%,end
I heard thump,
and you did a flip off the table.


00:13:40.186 --> 00:13:42.621 line:95%,end
- So, oh my god, I thought--
- Was that my first aerial?

00:13:42.688 --> 00:13:46.692 line:95%,end
[LAUGHS] Your first back flip.

00:13:46.759 --> 00:13:49.361 line:95%,end
And, um, I thought you were dead.

00:13:49.428 --> 00:13:52.598 line:95%,end
So the dance studio
was originally founded by you.

00:13:52.665 --> 00:13:57.102 line:95%,end
In 1945, you opened
the Maryen Lorrain Dance Studio.

00:13:57.169 --> 00:13:58.270 line:95%,end
Uh-huh.

00:13:58.337 --> 00:14:01.540 line:95%,end
And now the Abby Lee Dance
Company's kind of taken over.

00:14:01.674 --> 00:14:02.675 line:95%,end
Yeah.

00:14:02.741 --> 00:14:05.344 line:95%,end
So what kind of teacher was I at 14,
the same as I am now?

00:14:05.411 --> 00:14:06.645 line:95%,end
Yes, you were.

00:14:06.712 --> 00:14:08.347 line:95%,end
- So I was mean when I was 14?
- That was OK.

00:14:08.414 --> 00:14:10.749 line:95%,end
- No, you weren't really mean. I mean--
- OK.

00:14:10.816 --> 00:14:12.084 line:95%,end
- I was tough.
- You were tough.

00:14:12.151 --> 00:14:15.087 line:95%,end
You had a lot of students
that went on to do great things.

Uh-huh.

about Albert Stephenson.

And he worked with Liza Minnelli
in all of her shows

00:14:23.262 --> 00:14:25.164 line:95%,end
and did all the Kander and Ebb shows.

00:14:25.231 --> 00:14:28.434 line:95%,end
He did "Night of 100 Stars,"
all of those things.

- And Linda Lee.

00:14:34.206 --> 00:14:35.641 line:95%,end
I mean, she was fabulous.

It was 1951.

I was six years old when I came

You were my idol, and you still are.

00:14:58.697 --> 00:15:00.966 line:95%,end
You gave me a life and a career that

00:15:01.033 --> 00:15:03.335 line:95%,end
led to 15 Broadway musicals.

This is just one.

There's hundreds of people out there

00:15:43.976 --> 00:15:47.346 line:95%,end
that think of you as a mom.
What do you have to say about that?

00:15:47.413 --> 00:15:49.481 line:95%,end
I don't-- I don't have anything to say--

A 7's too high for me

00:31:46.704 --> 00:31:48.706 line:95%,end
I'd hear your name on the loudspeaker--

00:31:48.773 --> 00:31:50.675 line:95%,end
"Abby Miller, lost."

00:31:50.742 --> 00:31:53.211 line:95%,end
And I'm thinking, "Oh, my God.
She got lost."

00:31:53.278 --> 00:31:56.547 line:95%,end
I wanted to come out,
like ta-da, here I am.

00:31:56.614 --> 00:31:57.715 line:95%,end
[LAUGHS]

00:31:57.782 --> 00:31:59.250 line:95%,end
ANNOUNCER: Please welcome to the stage

00:31:59.317 --> 00:32:01.719 line:95%,end
"Where Have All the Children Gone?"

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:08.626 line:95%,end
The creaking silence of age
that goes through the streets,

00:32:09.427 --> 00:32:12.463 line:95%,end
sounds like old wooden floors
under heavy feet.

00:32:13.431 --> 00:32:17.769 line:95%,end
All of the children
once running around have evacuated,

00:32:18.569 --> 00:32:21.806 line:95%,end
or maybe they just disappeared.

00:32:23.074 --> 00:32:27.178 line:95%,end
Where have all the children gone?

00:32:27.412 --> 00:32:30.515 line:95%,end
Just yesterday,
they were tying ribbons in trees

00:32:30.581 --> 00:32:33.251 line:95%,end
and swinging from the branches.

00:32:33.318 --> 00:32:37.021 line:95%,end
Maybe this is just a dream.

00:32:38.122 --> 00:32:45.063 line:95%,end
Maybe we are sleeping in rooms
filled with metal shells.

00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:49.400 line:95%,end
If we put our ears to those shells,

00:32:49.467 --> 00:32:54.439 line:95%,end
where have all the children gone?

00:32:55.039 --> 00:32:59.644 line:95%,end
But we know this is really happening.

00:33:01.379 --> 00:33:06.084 line:95%,end
Where have all the children gone?

00:33:06.651 --> 00:33:09.487 line:95%,end
I've had a lot of favorites
throughout the years,

00:33:09.554 --> 00:33:12.857 line:95%,end
but a dancer like Maddie
doesn't come along too often.

00:33:13.424 --> 00:33:14.993 line:95%,end
She has the talent,

00:33:15.059 --> 00:33:19.197 line:95%,end
and she also has the drive,
the dedication, the discipline.

00:33:19.263 --> 00:33:20.765 line:95%,end
Right here, babe.

00:33:20.832 --> 00:33:23.835 line:95%,end
I'm taking Maddie to lunch
because Melissa's not around.

00:33:23.901 --> 00:33:26.437 line:95%,end
And all the moms
are doing stuff with their children,

00:33:26.504 --> 00:33:28.940 line:95%,end
so I thought we would go
to lunch together

00:33:29.007 --> 00:33:32.377 line:95%,end
and talk about her career,
talk about what she wants in the future.

00:33:32.443 --> 00:33:35.213 line:95%,end
What else do you want to do?
You just keep winning everything.

00:33:35.279 --> 00:33:36.447 line:95%,end
I want to be on Broadway.

00:33:36.514 --> 00:33:38.116 line:95%,end
You want to be on Broadway?

00:33:38.182 --> 00:33:40.418 line:95%,end
What about like here?
We're in LA.

00:33:40.485 --> 00:33:42.553 line:95%,end
Like, you don't think
you could be in a movie?

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:44.722 line:95%,end
I really see Maddie having a future.

00:33:44.789 --> 00:33:46.357 line:95%,end
She could have her own television show.

00:33:46.424 --> 00:33:47.725 line:95%,end
You know, she has it all.

00:33:47.792 --> 00:33:49.827 line:95%,end
She has what it takes,
and she wants it.

00:33:50.361 --> 00:33:51.896 line:95%,end
She's a nice little girl.

00:33:51.963 --> 00:33:53.664 line:95%,end
- She is a nice little girl.
- MARYEN: And she's nice--

00:33:53.731 --> 00:33:55.967 line:95%,end
- On stage. Yes.
- On stage, off stage.

00:33:56.034 --> 00:33:58.269 line:95%,end
And she's always the one
hugging everybody

00:33:58.336 --> 00:34:00.438 line:95%,end
and wishing them luck
before they go out on stage.

00:34:00.505 --> 00:34:02.473 line:95%,end
She reminds me of Shirley Temple a lot,

00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:05.977 line:95%,end
because Shirley Temple
had nothing bad to say about anybody.

00:34:06.044 --> 00:34:07.678 line:95%,end
And Maddie's like that.

00:34:07.745 --> 00:34:11.382 line:95%,end
She's-- She's always praising
everybody else.

00:34:11.449 --> 00:34:13.084 line:95%,end
That's a very nice compliment.

00:34:13.151 --> 00:34:15.420 line:95%,end
Maddie said thank you on the way out.

00:34:15.486 --> 00:34:17.922 line:95%,end
She knows her Ps and Qs
without you saying,

00:34:17.989 --> 00:34:20.391 line:95%,end
tell Mrs. Miller thank you,
tell this to do this,

00:34:20.458 --> 00:34:22.593 line:95%,end
do that, do that.
She knows to go do it.

00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:26.097 line:95%,end
That's special.
She's very obedient, and she listens.

00:34:26.164 --> 00:34:28.833 line:95%,end
She's got a brain like a sponge.

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:31.235 line:95%,end
- Mm-hmm. I agree.
- She's doing this.

00:34:31.302 --> 00:34:34.205 line:95%,end
She's doing that.
All of a sudden I see Shirley Temple.


00:34:34.272 --> 00:34:38.509 line:95%,end
Wow, this kid became something,
became something.

00:34:38.576 --> 00:34:40.711 line:95%,end
So you know.
And look at her now.

00:34:40.778 --> 00:34:42.980 line:95%,end
- I think Maddie has it all.
- Uh-huh.

00:34:43.047 --> 00:34:44.382 line:95%,end
The problem with the other kids

00:34:44.449 --> 00:34:46.951 line:95%,end
is they want instant gratification.

00:34:47.018 --> 00:34:50.288 line:95%,end
They want to work this much
and win everything.

00:34:50.354 --> 00:34:54.025 line:95%,end
- Yeah.
- Instead of working and winning.

00:34:54.092 --> 00:34:55.293 line:95%,end
They have it backwards.

00:34:56.027 --> 00:34:58.963 line:95%,end
And one kid
that had all the talent in the world

00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:02.166 line:95%,end
but didn't have the desire,
the dedication,

00:35:02.233 --> 00:35:04.368 line:95%,end
or the drive was Brooke.

00:35:04.435 --> 00:35:05.970 line:95%,end
- Goodbye.
- WOMAN: Bye.

00:35:06.804 --> 00:35:08.940 line:95%,end
BROOKE: I invited
Miss Abby to come out with me

00:35:09.006 --> 00:35:11.709 line:95%,end
so I can tell her that
I want to come back to dance.

00:35:11.776 --> 00:35:14.212 line:95%,end
Cheerleading just wasn't my thing.

00:35:14.712 --> 00:35:16.547 line:95%,end
Abby was really upset.

00:35:16.614 --> 00:35:18.549 line:95%,end
I don't know
if she's going to take me back,

00:35:18.616 --> 00:35:19.984 line:95%,end
but I hope she does.

00:35:20.051 --> 00:35:21.352 line:95%,end
So.

00:35:21.486 --> 00:35:22.487 line:95%,end
Um--

00:35:23.421 --> 00:35:25.289 line:95%,end
I tried cheerleading.

00:35:26.824 --> 00:35:29.494 line:95%,end
And I was wondering
if I could come back to dance.

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:31.896 line:95%,end
It's just not that easy, Brooke.

00:35:31.963 --> 00:35:33.431 line:95%,end
You stab everybody in the back.

00:35:33.498 --> 00:35:34.765 line:95%,end
You slapped me in the face.

00:35:34.832 --> 00:35:36.434 line:95%,end
She should've opened her mouth
and said,

00:35:36.501 --> 00:35:38.136 line:95%,end
"Let somebody else
be at the top of the pyramid."

00:35:38.202 --> 00:35:40.438 line:95%,end
She's screwing me.
I can feel it.

00:35:40.505 --> 00:35:42.773 line:95%,end
I just wanted to try it out
to make sure dance

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:43.941 line:95%,end
is what I wanted to do.

00:35:44.008 --> 00:35:46.978 line:95%,end
What my problem with that
was that you didn't speak up

00:35:47.044 --> 00:35:49.313 line:95%,end
and say something ahead of time.

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:51.282 line:95%,end
And I mean, you just didn't show up.

00:35:52.083 --> 00:35:53.618 line:95%,end
You let a lot of people down.

00:35:55.286 --> 00:35:56.787 line:95%,end
You let me down.

00:35:56.854 --> 00:35:58.756 line:95%,end
I'm very torn about this decision.

00:35:58.823 --> 00:36:01.125 line:95%,end
She let the team down.
She has lost trust.

00:36:01.192 --> 00:36:03.127 line:95%,end
And Brooke broke my heart.

00:36:03.194 --> 00:36:04.829 line:95%,end
My biggest disappointment, I think,

00:36:04.896 --> 00:36:07.498 line:95%,end
too would be that
you just didn't want to dance.

00:36:08.699 --> 00:36:11.002 line:95%,end
You have a God-given talent.

00:36:11.068 --> 00:36:12.637 line:95%,end
Don't throw it away, honey.

00:36:12.703 --> 00:36:16.374 line:95%,end
Brooke was born to dance,
and I have invested my time

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:19.143 line:95%,end
and my energy into this kid

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:22.547 line:95%,end
for it to go unnoticed
and just disappear.

00:36:23.181 --> 00:36:24.782 line:95%,end
I'm not gonna let that happen.

00:36:24.849 --> 00:36:27.218 line:95%,end
I think you have a lot
to offer to the team.

00:36:27.285 --> 00:36:28.986 line:95%,end
You're gonna have
to really prove yourself.

00:36:29.053 --> 00:36:30.521 line:95%,end
BROOKE: Abby finally said

00:36:30.588 --> 00:36:33.691 line:95%,end
she would be glad to have me back
in the Abby Lee Dance Company.

00:36:33.758 --> 00:36:38.062 line:95%,end
I was very happy,
and I'm never gonna let her down again.

00:36:39.096 --> 00:36:42.633 line:95%,end
Nothing like a little tea and sympathy.
I love Brooke.

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:46.737 line:95%,end
We have a great relationship,
even if she is her mother's daughter.

00:36:46.804 --> 00:36:51.042 line:95%,end
Every once in a while, even questionable
mothers have their moment of glory.

00:36:51.108 --> 00:36:55.513 line:95%,end
One particular moment
is Jill comforting her daughter Kendall.

00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:57.748 line:95%,end
I'm so sorry, honey.

00:36:57.815 --> 00:37:00.184 line:95%,end
I know. It'll never ever work.

00:37:00.251 --> 00:37:01.652 line:95%,end
It'll never work.

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:03.754 line:95%,end
OK.

00:37:03.821 --> 00:37:05.256 line:95%,end
[SOBS]

00:37:05.323 --> 00:37:06.490 line:95%,end
It's OK.

00:37:06.924 --> 00:37:09.293 line:95%,end
I'm trying so hard.

00:37:11.395 --> 00:37:14.465 line:95%,end
But as good as my moms can sometimes be,

00:37:14.532 --> 00:37:17.201 line:95%,end
they're really much better
at disappointing me.

00:37:17.501 --> 00:37:18.869 line:95%,end
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:20.838 line:95%,end
I cannot believe it.

00:37:20.905 --> 00:37:22.306 line:95%,end
These moms are ridiculous.

00:37:22.373 --> 00:37:25.042 line:95%,end
They are in a bar drinking,
and their kid needs

00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:26.944 line:95%,end
to be on stage in 20 minutes--

00:37:27.011 --> 00:37:28.479 line:95%,end
bad parenting 101.

00:37:28.546 --> 00:37:29.847 line:95%,end
MOM: Good lord.

00:37:29.914 --> 00:37:31.382 line:95%,end
Hey. What's going on?

00:37:32.817 --> 00:37:34.051 line:95%,end
We're having a cocktail.

00:37:34.118 --> 00:37:36.020 line:95%,end
- Am I babysitting?
- Do you want a drink?

00:37:36.087 --> 00:37:38.589 line:95%,end
No, no.
I don't drink while I'm working.

00:37:38.656 --> 00:37:40.191 line:95%,end
Are you two good to go?

00:37:40.258 --> 00:37:41.692 line:95%,end
- Yeah, we're gonna leave in a minute.
- All right.

We're double fisted.
It's not good.

00:37:50.134 --> 00:37:52.136 line:95%,end
I don't double fist
when I'm with my kids.

00:37:52.203 --> 00:37:54.238 line:95%,end
I double fist when I'm in college.


00:37:56.107 --> 00:37:58.476 line:5%,start
This has been a magnificent Mother's Day.

00:37:59.143 --> 00:38:03.214 line:5%,start
Mom, I am so happy and so fortunate

00:38:03.281 --> 00:38:04.949 line:95%,end
that we had this time together.

00:38:05.016 --> 00:38:11.055 line:95%,end
And after 85 years,
you are proof that beauty is timeless.

00:38:11.722 --> 00:38:14.158 line:95%,end
Beauty really is timeless.

This is you up close and true.

How wonderful it feels to be beautiful.

Oh, you know just who you are.

Well, that dress,
I have to tell you, it was borrowed.

00:39:52.223 --> 00:39:53.891 line:95%,end
- And he had to rent his--
- Tux.

00:39:53.958 --> 00:39:55.526 line:95%,end
- Yeah.
- Why didn't you buy a fabulous--

Because I really didn't even wanna
get this dress or any dress.

that did our costumes, she said,

So three daughters,

which dress did I want?

He fought.
He fought long, and he fought hard.
