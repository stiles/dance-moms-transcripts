ABBY LEE MILLER: Previously on Dance Moms.

00:00:02.902 --> 00:00:03.903 line:5%,start
CATHY: I need to win.

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:05.071 line:5%,start
I need to beat her.

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:06.506 line:5%,start
That's why you guys are here.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.408 line:5%,start
ABBY LEE MILLER: Jill is kind of stepping

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:09.642 line:5%,start
into Melissa's old spot.

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:11.011 line:5%,start
CATHY: That's a good girl. Go potty.

00:00:11.077 --> 00:00:13.146 line:5%,start
I don't like people going behind my back.

00:00:13.213 --> 00:00:14.914 line:5%,start
You know that's my problem with Melissa.

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:18.118 line:5%,start
CATHY: The boys are just amazing.

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:20.253 line:5%,start
ABBY LEE MILLER: I don't want
to be fourth in front of Cathy.

00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:23.323 line:5%,start
There's Chloe's hat.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:24.657 line:5%,start
Nice job, Chloe.

00:00:24.724 --> 00:00:27.293 line:5%,start
Go. We're leaving. I'm done. We're gone.

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:30.530 line:5%,start
Get away from me.

00:00:31.097 --> 00:00:32.465 line:5%,start
ABBY LEE MILLER: Coming up on Dance Moms.

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:34.467 line:5%,start
It's about time you got back here.

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:35.969 line:5%,start
Was she talking-- did you guys here that?

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:37.804 line:5%,start
Welcome to The Avalanche.

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:40.306 line:5%,start
Where's Kelly?
She's schmoozing with her new BFF.

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:42.675 line:5%,start
- Oh.
- Sophia will be doing a solo.

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:46.446 line:5%,start
CATHY: She's going down. I can feel it.

00:00:46.513 --> 00:00:48.648 line:5%,start
CHILDREN: Apple core. Apple core.

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:50.150 line:5%,start
This is a dog training tool.

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:52.352 line:5%,start
It means the dog sit down and shut up.

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:54.120 line:5%,start
- MAN: Are you saying--
- So your blood pressure--

00:00:54.187 --> 00:00:55.355 line:5%,start
- I have--
- Sit.

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:57.090 line:5%,start
Abby your blood pressure.

00:00:57.157 --> 00:00:58.525 line:5%,start
I'm just worried she's going
to have a heart attack.

00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:00.460 line:5%,start
- CATHY: So.
- Cathy no one wants to here.

00:01:00.527 --> 00:01:02.629 line:5%,start
- Just shut your mouth.
- Shut your mouth.

00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:07.000 line:5%,start
- Woo.
- Don't say anything about my child--

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:08.134 line:5%,start
- MAN: That's enough.
- [bleep]

THEME SONG: Get up.

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:13.606 line:95%,end
Get on the floor.

00:01:14.174 --> 00:01:17.043 line:95%,end
My world is with my girls.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.345 line:95%,end
Living on the dance floor.

[music playing]

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:27.053 line:95%,end
Oh, we're the first ones here.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.721 line:95%,end
Oh, it's a record.

00:01:28.788 --> 00:01:31.057 line:95%,end
Get undressed and start stretching.

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:32.725 line:95%,end
Hi, guys.

00:01:32.792 --> 00:01:34.761 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: Brooke,
you drive all the way here,

00:01:34.828 --> 00:01:36.329 line:95%,end
and you can't get that hair in a bun.

00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:38.998 line:95%,end
Hello.

00:01:39.065 --> 00:01:40.900 line:95%,end
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

00:01:40.967 --> 00:01:43.403 line:95%,end
Have you guys seen Christi?
Is she out there? Is she coming?

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.039 line:95%,end
I think she's mad at me
because I said something about the hat.

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:47.474 line:95%,end
Which is crazy.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.542 line:95%,end
- It is--
- I mean we all saw the hat.

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:52.745 line:95%,end
Every week somebody
messes up in a group dance.

00:01:52.812 --> 00:01:54.714 line:95%,end
Well, I wonder if Christi is not coming.

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:56.316 line:95%,end
I find that hard to believe.

00:01:56.382 --> 00:01:58.451 line:95%,end
Christi has never left before.

00:01:58.718 --> 00:01:59.919 line:95%,end
Nice job, Chloe.

00:02:00.587 --> 00:02:02.822 line:95%,end
- Huh? Nice job.
- Let's go. We're leaving.

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:04.424 line:95%,end
You want Chloe gone, we're gone.

00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:06.292 line:95%,end
You go ahead and replace me.
I'm leaving.

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:07.527 line:95%,end
I'm not going to make a scene with you.

00:02:07.594 --> 00:02:08.595 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: --that's
the easy way out, right?

00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:11.197 line:95%,end
No, I'm done. I'm done.
This is not what I signed up for.

00:02:11.264 --> 00:02:14.334 line:95%,end
At some point we have all
threatened to leave and storm out

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.935 line:95%,end
and she's never done that.

00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:19.172 line:5%,start
We're back at Abby's,
another week, another competition

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.808 line:5%,start
is looming, no Christi, no Chloe.

00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:24.144 line:95%,end
Maybe you'll have a spot
on the pyramid, Brooke.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.246 line:95%,end
I don't want to dance without Chloe.

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:28.681 line:95%,end
I don't have my twinning power.

00:02:28.781 --> 00:02:30.183 line:95%,end
Your twinning power?

00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:34.087 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:02:37.457 --> 00:02:40.160 line:95%,end
Come on, ladies,
let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:42.262 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.130 line:95%,end
[sighs]

00:02:44.964 --> 00:02:46.399 line:95%,end
All right.

00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:48.701 line:95%,end
Last week you walked in here
and you were losers.

00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:51.337 line:95%,end
Fourth place.

00:02:51.404 --> 00:02:52.539 line:95%,end
Today you're winners.

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:54.941 line:95%,end
You walk in here like, woo, we won.

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:57.210 line:95%,end
ANNOUNCER: And the winner
goes to number 215.

00:02:57.377 --> 00:03:00.647 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:03:02.415 --> 00:03:03.616 line:95%,end
And that's all fine and dandy.

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:08.188 line:95%,end
But let's be realistic
you won by a tenth of a point.

00:03:08.254 --> 00:03:12.091 line:95%,end
I don't want the Abby Lee
Dance Company to be just 1/10

00:03:12.158 --> 00:03:14.527 line:95%,end
of a point ahead of the who you beat.

00:03:14.594 --> 00:03:16.062 line:95%,end
I don't want it.

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:18.831 line:95%,end
I want you to be 30 points ahead,
or 20 points ahead,

00:03:18.898 --> 00:03:22.669 line:95%,end
or 10 points, or for goodness sake,
one whole point.

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:25.805 line:95%,end
Can we be one whole point
above the next group?

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:28.474 line:95%,end
Abby, do you know where
Christi and Chloe are?

00:03:29.442 --> 00:03:31.377 line:95%,end
I'm dealing with them.

00:03:31.444 --> 00:03:33.146 line:95%,end
I'm going to do something
a little different today

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:34.948 line:95%,end
and I'm going to start at the top.

00:03:35.014 --> 00:03:39.352 line:95%,end
Finally, for the first time ever Kendall

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:40.720 line:95%,end
is at the top of the pyramid.

00:03:40.787 --> 00:03:42.855 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:03:42.922 --> 00:03:44.123 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: You're
on top of the pyramid.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.191 line:95%,end
Hallelujah.

00:03:45.258 --> 00:03:47.594 line:95%,end
Kendall, you beat a lot of great people.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.395 line:95%,end
One of them was Chloe.

00:03:49.462 --> 00:03:51.464 line:95%,end
Seeing Kendall at the top of the pyramid

00:03:51.531 --> 00:03:54.968 line:5%,start
makes all this hard work
and all the fighting worth it.

00:03:55.134 --> 00:03:56.769 line:5%,start
I'm so happy right now.

00:03:56.836 --> 00:03:59.239 line:95%,end
Jill, I think you just made an enemy.

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:01.774 line:95%,end
I don't think Christi can handle
your 9-year-old

00:04:02.208 --> 00:04:06.346 line:95%,end
beating her 11-year-old
who is a national titleholder right now.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.147 line:95%,end
I think you need to watch out.


00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:15.121 line:95%,end
Next, Maddie, I'm not going
to tell you, you were amazing.

00:04:15.188 --> 00:04:16.522 line:95%,end
I don't think you are.

00:04:17.123 --> 00:04:18.391 line:95%,end
And then moving on.

00:04:19.058 --> 00:04:20.526 line:95%,end
Nia.

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:24.564 line:95%,end
Nia, you went out, your arms were pretty,

00:04:25.231 --> 00:04:28.334 line:95%,end
started off strong, fizzled.

00:04:29.068 --> 00:04:31.771 line:95%,end
Next, I have Paige.

00:04:32.872 --> 00:04:37.410 line:95%,end
Paige, I don't want to go over
and over things in class.

00:04:37.477 --> 00:04:41.547 line:95%,end
I want to tell you one time
and I want you to do it.

00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:44.384 line:95%,end
And next, Mackenzie.

00:04:45.985 --> 00:04:49.155 line:95%,end
Tell me what you did
because I heard

00:04:49.222 --> 00:04:50.723 line:95%,end
that you were
in the audience watching

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.459 line:95%,end
then I saw you
sleeping in the dressing room.

00:04:53.526 --> 00:04:55.528 line:95%,end
You're like dead weight
coming along with us.

00:04:55.595 --> 00:04:56.796 line:95%,end
We don't need you there.

00:04:57.163 --> 00:05:00.500 line:95%,end
Obviously on the bottom
of the pyramid is Chloe.

00:05:00.566 --> 00:05:03.403 line:95%,end
Chloe made a mistake.

00:05:03.903 --> 00:05:07.507 line:95%,end
I told you all not to drop your hat.

00:05:08.608 --> 00:05:10.009 line:95%,end
She dropped her hat.

00:05:10.243 --> 00:05:13.346 line:95%,end
SONG: Just serve yourself.

00:05:14.047 --> 00:05:17.116 line:95%,end
Make lemonade.

00:05:18.184 --> 00:05:21.754 line:95%,end
Chloe is suspended so is her mother.

00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:25.091 line:95%,end
Her behavior was deplorable.

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:28.494 line:95%,end
Abby, shut up. Shut up.
Stop talking now.

00:05:28.561 --> 00:05:29.796 line:95%,end
Replace us that's fine.

00:05:29.862 --> 00:05:33.333 line:95%,end
Come on, Chloe, we're done.
Get away from me.

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:35.668 line:95%,end
I do not want her
anywhere near this studio.

00:05:37.036 --> 00:05:40.440 line:95%,end
She was an embarrassment
to the Abby Lee Dance Company,

00:05:40.506 --> 00:05:41.607 line:95%,end
and to all of you.

00:05:41.674 --> 00:05:43.943 line:95%,end
Abby how long is she sus--
what does that mean it's--

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.011 line:95%,end
I don't know.

00:05:45.078 --> 00:05:46.846 line:95%,end
I would like to know how long
it's going to take to get

00:05:46.913 --> 00:05:48.247 line:95%,end
Brooke back on the pyramid.

00:05:48.781 --> 00:05:49.982 line:95%,end
Funny you should mention that.

00:05:51.584 --> 00:05:53.453 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:05:56.489 --> 00:05:58.257 line:95%,end
You might want to send Chloe
a thank you note

00:05:58.324 --> 00:06:01.094 line:95%,end
because her mother just bought you
a spot on the pyramid.

00:06:02.228 --> 00:06:06.766 line:95%,end
This weekend we are going to Star
Power International Talent Competition

00:06:06.833 --> 00:06:08.534 line:95%,end
in Detroit, Michigan.

00:06:08.601 --> 00:06:12.071 line:95%,end
Is there a studio from Ohio
going all the way to Detroit?

00:06:12.638 --> 00:06:14.173 line:95%,end
Yes, there is.

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:17.577 line:95%,end
Cathy is coming back for you all big time.

00:06:18.177 --> 00:06:20.580 line:95%,end
I can't believe Cathy's
coming this weekend.

00:06:20.646 --> 00:06:23.015 line:95%,end
I really wanted to revel and enjoy

00:06:23.082 --> 00:06:25.017 line:95%,end
that Kendall's at the top of the pyramid,

00:06:25.084 --> 00:06:27.653 line:95%,end
she's going to get special attention,

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:32.058 line:95%,end
and now I have to deal with Cathy,
the Wicked Witch of Ohio.

00:06:32.125 --> 00:06:34.327 line:95%,end
We have a group routine everybody's in it.

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:35.928 line:95%,end
I am down one dancer.

00:06:36.696 --> 00:06:38.898 line:95%,end
I cannot afford any weak links.

00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:42.702 line:95%,end
Kendall, you will be doing
a solo again this weekend.

00:06:42.769 --> 00:06:44.370 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:06:45.772 --> 00:06:49.375 line:95%,end
Paige, I'm going to give you
a duet with Nia.

00:06:49.442 --> 00:06:51.811 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:06:52.645 --> 00:06:55.481 line:95%,end
The last week you thought
your good wasn't good enough.

00:06:55.548 --> 00:06:57.817 line:95%,end
This is your chance, don't blow it.

00:06:57.884 --> 00:06:59.552 line:95%,end
I have one more routine left.

00:07:00.019 --> 00:07:02.321 line:95%,end
Maddie, you will be
doing a solo this week.

00:07:02.388 --> 00:07:04.223 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:05.558 line:95%,end
Don't be so elated.

00:07:05.625 --> 00:07:09.128 line:95%,end
It's like a default, like fine,
process of elimination.

00:07:09.195 --> 00:07:11.297 line:95%,end
I need somebody that's going to win

00:07:11.364 --> 00:07:14.434 line:95%,end
and you can bet that, that boys group,
one of those boys

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.135 line:95%,end
is going to be doing a solo.

00:07:16.202 --> 00:07:18.905 line:5%,start
It's been so long since
Maddie's had a solo

00:07:18.971 --> 00:07:22.341 line:5%,start
I hope the added pressure
of the boys and Cathy's team

00:07:22.408 --> 00:07:23.810 line:95%,end
doesn't rattle her.

00:07:23.876 --> 00:07:26.712 line:95%,end
Everybody needs to be outstanding.

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:30.183 line:95%,end
Moms we can't lose.

00:07:30.249 --> 00:07:31.717 line:95%,end
We won't lose.

00:07:31.784 --> 00:07:34.720 line:95%,end
You guys go out there on
that stage, and screw up,

00:07:34.787 --> 00:07:38.024 line:95%,end
and we don't win
I might replace everybody.

00:07:38.858 --> 00:07:42.562 line:95%,end
If I can suspend Chloe
I can suspend you too.

00:07:43.963 --> 00:07:45.431 line:95%,end
Does everybody understand?

00:07:45.932 --> 00:07:49.068 line:95%,end
Cathy is not going to get the
best of me with all these boys.

00:07:49.702 --> 00:07:52.305 line:95%,end
All right, moms you're dismissed.
Guys spread apart, let's go.

00:07:52.371 --> 00:07:54.307 line:95%,end
Gianna, I want you to bring in the prop.

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:57.376 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:08:01.714 --> 00:08:07.286 line:5%,start
All right, girls. So you understand Nia
that you are the wallflower,

00:08:07.353 --> 00:08:09.589 line:5%,start
and Paige is the wild child.

00:08:09.655 --> 00:08:11.791 line:5%,start
My duet this week is called the wild child

00:08:11.858 --> 00:08:13.192 line:5%,start
in the wallflower.

00:08:13.259 --> 00:08:14.494 line:95%,end
I play the wallflower.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.997 line:95%,end
I'm kind of shy and quiet,
kind of how I am.


00:08:18.431 --> 00:08:21.901 line:95%,end
Twist and lunge off the chair this way.

00:08:21.968 --> 00:08:24.871 line:95%,end
Good. Twist but you're not going
to stand all the way up.

00:08:24.937 --> 00:08:28.007 line:95%,end
You're not going to stand up.
You're just going to kind of sh.

00:08:28.074 --> 00:08:29.909 line:95%,end
- Sh.
- Yes. Good.

00:08:30.409 --> 00:08:32.745 line:95%,end
So do you think Nia
is excited about the duet?

00:08:32.812 --> 00:08:36.649 line:95%,end
Oh, my goodness, she is thrilled
but at the same time

00:08:36.716 --> 00:08:38.451 line:95%,end
Nia is very nervous about it too.

00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:39.785 line:95%,end
Why.

00:08:39.852 --> 00:08:42.154 line:95%,end
Well, when Nia get stressed

00:08:43.122 --> 00:08:46.492 line:95%,end
she can have a tendency of having
a relapse with her pain management.

00:08:46.559 --> 00:08:48.027 line:95%,end
So do you think it's stress related?

00:08:48.094 --> 00:08:51.831 line:95%,end
It's usually stress related.
Stressful situations will trigger that.

00:08:51.898 --> 00:08:55.301 line:95%,end
And you don't have an injury, like that's
the whole kicker of the thing.

00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:57.470 line:95%,end
Nia suffers from a neurological disorder

00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:01.307 line:95%,end
called reflex neurovascular dystrophy
or R&amp;D

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:03.509 line:95%,end
and there's a direct correlation
to stress.

00:09:03.576 --> 00:09:05.378 line:95%,end
So when Nia is in a stressful environment

00:09:05.444 --> 00:09:07.146 line:95%,end
I get very concerned.

00:09:07.213 --> 00:09:10.149 line:95%,end
That is strange.
It is very, very, strange.

00:09:10.216 --> 00:09:12.251 line:95%,end
But they say there's
a certain type of kid

00:09:12.318 --> 00:09:14.453 line:95%,end
that may be predisposed to having it.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.255 line:95%,end
Kids who are like perfectionists.

00:09:16.322 --> 00:09:18.190 line:95%,end
The type A kind of personality.

00:09:18.257 --> 00:09:20.126 line:95%,end
Overachiever kind of kids.

00:09:20.192 --> 00:09:23.062 line:95%,end
Oh, really is that what
the-- isn't that weird?

00:09:23.129 --> 00:09:24.664 line:95%,end
Oh, God.
I'm surprised Maddie doesn't have it.

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:27.767 line:5%,start
Shut up Melissa. Does everything have
to be about your child?

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.202 line:95%,end
I just wish Christi was
here because she would have

00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:32.572 line:95%,end
something funny to say
and make us all laugh.

00:09:32.638 --> 00:09:36.242 line:95%,end
They're just kids
who are predisposed to it.

00:09:36.309 --> 00:09:38.377 line:95%,end
But she can have this
for the rest of her life.

00:09:38.444 --> 00:09:40.413 line:95%,end
It's one of those things
that she'll have forever.

00:09:40.479 --> 00:09:41.847 line:95%,end
And it's not been for two years?

00:09:41.914 --> 00:09:44.684 line:95%,end
It's been-- yeah.
We've been two years without it.

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:46.886 line:95%,end
Oh, God. Well, please don't make it
happen ever at duet.

00:09:46.953 --> 00:09:48.354 line:95%,end
Well, I--

00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:50.656 line:95%,end
There's nothing that
stressful about a duet, Holly.

00:09:50.723 --> 00:09:53.392 line:95%,end
It's not the duet.
She likes the idea of the duet.

00:09:53.459 --> 00:09:55.127 line:95%,end
It's the idea of failure.

00:09:55.194 --> 00:09:57.563 line:95%,end
Put your foot behind the chair.

00:09:59.165 --> 00:10:04.804 line:95%,end
Go again. Nia, this is the third time I'm
yelling at you about something ridiculous.

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:06.572 line:95%,end
Oh. Now, she's yelling at her.

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:08.774 line:95%,end
That's not going to be helpful.

00:10:08.841 --> 00:10:11.143 line:95%,end
DOCTOR: So Holl, tell me about Nia's toe.

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:13.212 line:95%,end
After the dance yesterday

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:15.414 line:95%,end
I thought you know what,
let me just take her to the ER

00:10:15.481 --> 00:10:16.549 line:95%,end
and be done with that.

00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:19.352 line:95%,end
Nia's been complaining recently
of her foot hurting

00:10:19.418 --> 00:10:23.522 line:95%,end
and because she has R&amp;D
we take pain very seriously.

00:10:23.589 --> 00:10:26.792 line:95%,end
And I have to be sure whether
this is a painfully to injury

00:10:26.859 --> 00:10:29.228 line:95%,end
or is this a pain related to stress.

00:10:29.295 --> 00:10:31.397 line:95%,end
Obviously she's in some discomfort

00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:34.467 line:95%,end
and she injured her toe,
like there's no question about that.

00:10:34.533 --> 00:10:36.602 line:95%,end
But they said there--
is not fractured.

00:10:36.669 --> 00:10:39.238 line:95%,end
Like don't worry about it she'll be fine.

00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:40.906 line:95%,end
So you need to get your brain
in your head

00:10:40.973 --> 00:10:43.843 line:95%,end
I'm speaking English,
you know English, let's do it.

00:10:43.909 --> 00:10:45.811 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:10:52.418 --> 00:10:54.620 line:95%,end
- So how is everybody?
- Good.

00:10:54.687 --> 00:10:57.123 line:5%,start
Mom, it looks like you're outnumbered now.

00:10:57.189 --> 00:10:59.058 line:5%,start
We have all of these
handsome gentlemen

00:10:59.125 --> 00:11:00.526 line:5%,start
that are standing with us.

00:11:00.593 --> 00:11:01.861 line:5%,start
So happy to see all of you.

00:11:01.927 --> 00:11:04.196 line:95%,end
Listen, we're going to Detroit
this weekend

00:11:04.263 --> 00:11:07.700 line:95%,end
because guess who
we're going to go try and find?

00:11:07.767 --> 00:11:09.001 line:95%,end
Abby.

00:11:09.068 --> 00:11:11.303 line:95%,end
CATHY: What do you guys think
about what happened last time?

00:11:11.771 --> 00:11:13.773 line:95%,end
We got written off.

00:11:13.839 --> 00:11:17.877 line:95%,end
You really dropped Abby to her knees.

00:11:18.544 --> 00:11:21.547 line:95%,end
She-- well, maybe she's not
able to drop to her knees

00:11:21.614 --> 00:11:23.315 line:95%,end
but maybe her cankles shivered.

00:11:23.382 --> 00:11:24.417 line:95%,end
[laughing]

00:11:24.483 --> 00:11:28.621 line:5%,start
But nonetheless,
you set her up and it was great.

00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:30.890 line:95%,end
- Let's see who--
- Let's do this.

00:11:30.956 --> 00:11:32.725 line:95%,end
CATHY: --is going to
hit the perfect pyramid.

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:37.763 line:95%,end
First we have Brandon.

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:41.834 line:95%,end
Brandon brings to the board
amazing technique.

00:11:41.901 --> 00:11:44.537 line:95%,end
Next Jalen.

00:11:45.604 --> 00:11:47.873 line:95%,end
Jalen has moved to the middle.

00:11:48.507 --> 00:11:51.477 line:95%,end
Next we have Zack.

00:11:52.111 --> 00:11:56.115 line:95%,end
Zack, I think your
extensions are to die for.

00:11:56.182 --> 00:11:57.516 line:95%,end
Thank you.

00:11:57.583 --> 00:12:00.753 line:95%,end
CATHY: So at the top
and also doing a solo this week

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:04.557 line:95%,end
is my hot young lad from Miami, Gino.

00:12:05.858 --> 00:12:09.295 line:95%,end
So with that being said
number two tries harder.

00:12:09.361 --> 00:12:11.063 line:95%,end
So I need game faces on.

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:14.100 line:95%,end
We are not a dance team
that takes off their hats

00:12:14.166 --> 00:12:15.634 line:95%,end
and the curls come tumbling.

00:12:16.335 --> 00:12:18.604 line:95%,end
We are an army.
Ready for war.

00:12:18.671 --> 00:12:21.073 line:95%,end
CATHY: Good, good. I like you.


00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:25.611 line:5%,start
[music playing]

00:12:30.816 --> 00:12:34.153 line:5%,start
From 1 to 10,
10 being the highest ,1 being the lowest,

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:35.988 line:95%,end
what's the pain in this foot right now?

00:12:36.055 --> 00:12:37.957 line:95%,end
Probably a 7.

00:12:38.023 --> 00:12:41.761 line:95%,end
The 7 is too high for me
because that means

00:12:41.827 --> 00:12:44.497 line:95%,end
you're feeling pain
while you're dancing

00:12:44.563 --> 00:12:46.899 line:95%,end
you're feeling pain more often than not.

00:12:48.567 --> 00:12:50.236 line:5%,start
Nia has been treated for R&amp;D

00:12:50.302 --> 00:12:52.705 line:5%,start
which is reflexive
neurovascular disorder,

00:12:52.772 --> 00:12:54.874 line:95%,end
which is basically
a pain management disorder.

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:59.245 line:95%,end
Three Summers ago
Nia woke up with excruciating pain.

00:12:59.311 --> 00:13:01.614 line:95%,end
Nia couldn't walk.
Nia was in a wheelchair.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:04.650 line:95%,end
She was hospital bound.
Came on suddenly.

00:13:04.717 --> 00:13:06.852 line:95%,end
Nia was basically out of the dance.

00:13:06.919 --> 00:13:10.122 line:95%,end
My sense is that it reminds me
when you were back

00:13:10.189 --> 00:13:12.458 line:95%,end
in the hospital
was that scaring you a little bit?

00:13:12.525 --> 00:13:13.626 line:95%,end
Yeah.

00:13:13.692 --> 00:13:16.929 line:95%,end
Nia manages her pain really well
on a regular basis

00:13:16.996 --> 00:13:22.501 line:95%,end
but if she's in a stressful situation
it can become inflamed.

00:13:22.568 --> 00:13:24.837 line:95%,end
What do you think
is stressing you out in particular?

00:13:24.904 --> 00:13:26.772 line:95%,end
I'm just kind of afraid my best

00:13:26.839 --> 00:13:28.808 line:95%,end
isn't good enough right now.

00:13:28.874 --> 00:13:30.643 line:95%,end
You can't give up.

00:13:30.709 --> 00:13:32.378 line:95%,end
You more than anyone else on that team

00:13:32.444 --> 00:13:36.549 line:95%,end
deserves a spot
because you worked 10 times as hard.

00:13:36.615 --> 00:13:39.084 line:95%,end
No one else on that team
was in a wheelchair.

00:13:39.151 --> 00:13:40.686 line:95%,end
We didn't know
if you were ever going to dance

00:13:40.753 --> 00:13:44.056 line:95%,end
and now you're dancing,
you owe that to yourself.

00:13:44.123 --> 00:13:46.058 line:95%,end
Okay.

00:13:46.125 --> 00:13:52.665 line:95%,end
Everyday Nia wakes up, she proves to me
that this is a kid who is a fighter.

00:13:52.731 --> 00:13:57.436 line:95%,end
She is a kid who wants to
live every moment of her life

00:13:57.503 --> 00:13:58.771 line:95%,end
to the fullest.

00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:00.606 line:95%,end
What do you think about
the duet are you excited?

00:14:01.307 --> 00:14:03.609 line:95%,end
I like seeing that light in your eyes.

00:14:03.676 --> 00:14:05.077 line:95%,end
You look happy.

00:14:06.278 --> 00:14:08.113 line:95%,end
You look excited about it.

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:12.952 line:95%,end
I think for a moment you forgot
about your pain in your foot

00:14:13.686 --> 00:14:16.255 line:95%,end
and you remembered the joy
of just dancing.

00:14:16.322 --> 00:14:18.023 line:95%,end
I'm proud of you.

00:14:26.732 --> 00:14:29.501 line:95%,end
I wonder what Christi- I wonder
what she's doing now like my free time.

00:14:29.568 --> 00:14:33.639 line:95%,end
Taking a bubble bath with a candle
lit having a glass of wine.

00:14:33.706 --> 00:14:35.608 line:95%,end
I would maybe take some cooking classes.

00:14:35.674 --> 00:14:37.009 line:5%,start
Oh, God.

00:14:38.277 --> 00:14:39.812 line:5%,start
Don't let your feet fly around.

00:14:41.981 --> 00:14:44.617 line:5%,start
We're doing a group routine
called avalanche.

00:14:44.683 --> 00:14:47.519 line:5%,start
It's about burying them alive.

00:14:47.586 --> 00:14:50.222 line:5%,start
So we have these sharp little ski bunnies,

00:14:50.289 --> 00:14:53.559 line:95%,end
chucking up the mountain,
rappelling down the mountain.

00:14:53.626 --> 00:14:55.427 line:95%,end
Somebody misses a step

00:14:56.262 --> 00:14:59.531 line:95%,end
there's an avalanche
everybody drops like flies.

00:15:02.768 --> 00:15:04.970 line:95%,end
- I never saw that.
- HOLLY: That's all new stuff.

00:15:05.037 --> 00:15:08.073 line:95%,end
Watch out, boys,
the girls are coming to get you.

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:09.675 line:95%,end
Wouldn't be great if we--

00:15:10.776 --> 00:15:12.011 line:95%,end
2 times in a row.

00:15:12.077 --> 00:15:15.247 line:95%,end
And why don't you get up on the prop.

00:15:15.681 --> 00:15:16.849 line:95%,end
Where is the prop?

00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:18.651 line:95%,end
I told your mothers to get that prop.

00:15:18.717 --> 00:15:20.052 line:95%,end
Where's the prop?

00:15:21.086 --> 00:15:23.155 line:95%,end
Let's get that prop.
I'll go look for the prop.

00:15:23.222 --> 00:15:24.323 line:95%,end
Melissa, you know where it is.

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:27.893 line:95%,end
We have a very large
white, heavy, wooden, prop,

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.762 line:95%,end
and it's going to serve as our mountain,


00:15:29.828 --> 00:15:31.797 line:95%,end
and the survivor of the avalanche

00:15:31.864 --> 00:15:33.766 line:95%,end
runs up to the top of that mountain

00:15:33.832 --> 00:15:38.370 line:95%,end
and looks back at all the people
that are no longer with her.

00:15:38.437 --> 00:15:40.372 line:95%,end
So this is like the mountain
and you're trying

00:15:40.439 --> 00:15:41.840 line:95%,end
every which way to get up it.

00:15:41.907 --> 00:15:44.276 line:95%,end
I'm just not getting anything
from you guys.

00:15:44.343 --> 00:15:47.780 line:95%,end
I need a kid like that's going
to think outside the box.

00:15:47.846 --> 00:15:49.415 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: Can
you slide through that?

00:15:49.481 --> 00:15:51.216 line:95%,end
Oh, look, look, look.
Oh, my god.

00:15:51.283 --> 00:15:52.952 line:95%,end
She's the only skinny one
who can fit through there.

00:15:53.018 --> 00:15:55.387 line:95%,end
[laughing]

00:15:55.454 --> 00:15:57.289 line:95%,end
Look how beautiful she looks

00:15:57.356 --> 00:15:59.391 line:95%,end
even playing dead she's beautiful.

00:15:59.458 --> 00:16:02.428 line:95%,end
We wanted somebody to be found
like they were dead.

00:16:02.494 --> 00:16:04.863 line:95%,end
And I said who can I make blue?

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:09.335 line:95%,end
And D said, Paige would be the easiest
just because she's the fairest.

00:16:09.401 --> 00:16:12.504 line:95%,end
- I don't want her painted blue.
- Yeah, that's what the girls were saying.

00:16:12.571 --> 00:16:14.807 line:95%,end
Yeah, I don't want her painted blue.

00:16:14.873 --> 00:16:18.444 line:95%,end
Hello, it's about time you got back here.

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:19.945 line:5%,start
Was she talking-- did you guys hear that?

00:16:20.012 --> 00:16:22.815 line:5%,start
All right, listen, I want
to hear all about everything

00:16:22.881 --> 00:16:25.384 line:95%,end
but right now we have
a group routine to do

00:16:25.451 --> 00:16:27.353 line:95%,end
and I'm down a person
so you're in the group.

00:16:27.419 --> 00:16:30.556 line:95%,end
Unbeknownst to me Jackie and Sophia

00:16:30.622 --> 00:16:32.191 line:95%,end
show back up in Pittsburgh.

00:16:32.257 --> 00:16:35.227 line:95%,end
But you know what, I told
Jackie any time that Sophia is available

00:16:35.294 --> 00:16:39.465 line:95%,end
and wants to be part of the
Abby Lee Dance Company competition team

00:16:39.531 --> 00:16:40.733 line:95%,end
she's more than welcome.

00:16:40.799 --> 00:16:43.569 line:95%,end
All right.
Sophia, welcome to the Avalanche.

00:16:44.103 --> 00:16:45.671 line:95%,end
We didn't know you were coming.

00:16:45.738 --> 00:16:47.806 line:95%,end
Now that Jackie and Sophia show up

00:16:47.906 --> 00:16:49.908 line:5%,start
I'm not really thrilled that they're here

00:16:49.975 --> 00:16:54.947 line:5%,start
I'm just hoping that Sophia doesn't take
Maddie's solo away.

00:16:55.014 --> 00:16:56.448 line:95%,end
So was this a surprise for Abby

00:16:56.515 --> 00:16:57.783 line:95%,end
did she know you were coming.

00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:00.019 line:95%,end
We've been trying to come back
for a few weeks now

00:17:00.085 --> 00:17:03.155 line:95%,end
and then it just becomes like
such short notice and I'm like,

00:17:03.222 --> 00:17:05.624 line:95%,end
oh, I'll try. And then something
will come up and I'll be like I can't.

00:17:05.691 --> 00:17:07.393 line:95%,end
And so I think she was disappointed

00:17:07.459 --> 00:17:09.495 line:95%,end
and I was actually afraid
that she'd be upset with me.

00:17:09.561 --> 00:17:11.463 line:95%,end
I'm sure any time you
arrive she would be--

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:13.198 line:5%,start
welcomed you with open arms.

00:17:13.265 --> 00:17:15.434 line:5%,start
Sophia does movies,
and commercials,

00:17:15.501 --> 00:17:18.570 line:5%,start
and things like that, and I have been
wanting to get Jackie alone

00:17:18.637 --> 00:17:21.173 line:95%,end
to ask her for some of her contacts

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:24.176 line:95%,end
that maybe I can contact
them and see if they would be

00:17:24.243 --> 00:17:25.444 line:95%,end
interested in my kids.

00:17:25.511 --> 00:17:27.012 line:95%,end
I've actually been meaning to call you.

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:30.616 line:95%,end
I have-- Brooke likes to sing,
and Paige likes to do modeling,

00:17:30.682 --> 00:17:34.219 line:95%,end
and I want to try to
get their name out there

00:17:34.286 --> 00:17:36.021 line:95%,end
and I want to get some
contacts out in LA and stuff.

00:17:36.088 --> 00:17:37.089 line:95%,end
Okay.

00:17:37.156 --> 00:17:38.390 line:95%,end
And I didn't know
if you would be able to get me.

00:17:38.457 --> 00:17:40.159 line:95%,end
Yeah, I'll give you
Sydney's agent's number.

00:17:40.225 --> 00:17:42.194 line:95%,end
I think Jackie is a really nice lady

00:17:42.261 --> 00:17:44.596 line:95%,end
and we seem to have a lot in common.

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:48.901 line:95%,end
We both want our kids
to do more than just dance.

00:17:48.967 --> 00:17:52.571 line:95%,end
We want them to get
further in this career.

00:17:52.638 --> 00:17:53.672 line:95%,end
It's been a crazy week.

00:17:53.739 --> 00:17:56.241 line:95%,end
I feel so bad about all
this crap with Christi.

00:17:56.308 --> 00:17:58.477 line:95%,end
All I did was say her hat dropped.

00:17:58.544 --> 00:17:59.778 line:95%,end
- It wasn't like--
- Yeah.

00:17:59.845 --> 00:18:02.047 line:95%,end
I feel bad for you, I'm sorry.

00:18:02.114 --> 00:18:03.115 line:95%,end
It's been crazy here.

00:18:03.215 --> 00:18:04.216 line:95%,end
Oh, my God.

00:18:04.283 --> 00:18:06.618 line:95%,end
Maddie hasn't had a solo
since you've been gone.

00:18:06.685 --> 00:18:07.986 line:95%,end
- Are you serious?
- Mm-hmm.

00:18:08.053 --> 00:18:10.389 line:95%,end
I just think like with Christi and Melissa

00:18:10.489 --> 00:18:13.125 line:95%,end
they have something to lose
by Sophia being here.

00:18:13.192 --> 00:18:15.260 line:95%,end
I don't think that they
shouldn't think that way.

00:18:15.327 --> 00:18:16.728 line:95%,end
Like you're a threat to them.

00:18:16.795 --> 00:18:19.198 line:95%,end
- Where's Kelly?
- She's schmoozing with her BFF.

00:18:19.264 --> 00:18:20.532 line:95%,end
Oh.

00:18:20.599 --> 00:18:22.134 line:95%,end
I think she's taking her place.

00:18:22.701 --> 00:18:24.470 line:95%,end
Jackie is taking Christi's place.

00:18:24.536 --> 00:18:26.238 line:95%,end
Can she be her drinking buddy?

00:18:26.305 --> 00:18:28.373 line:95%,end
I guess we don't-- she don't want us.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.008 line:95%,end
[laughing]

00:18:30.075 --> 00:18:31.076 line:95%,end
Let's go to lunch though I'm excited.

00:18:31.143 --> 00:18:32.211 line:95%,end
- That sounds good.
- Yeah.

00:18:32.277 --> 00:18:33.745 line:95%,end
We still never had our drink.

[music playing]

00:18:40.285 --> 00:18:44.823 line:5%,start
I want you to dazzle me more
than you did the last time.

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:47.192 line:5%,start
This weekend the routine
that the boys are doing

00:18:47.259 --> 00:18:48.494 line:5%,start
is called Top Of The World.

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:52.097 line:95%,end
They are doing jazz, hip hop, acrobatic,

00:18:52.164 --> 00:18:54.533 line:95%,end
and there's a lot of personality involved.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.935 line:95%,end
We are ultimately telling
a story in this dance

00:18:57.002 --> 00:18:59.505 line:95%,end
and I think that those kind of dances

00:18:59.571 --> 00:19:02.774 line:95%,end
are the ones that usually
are the most captivating.

00:19:02.841 --> 00:19:05.377 line:95%,end
They're all kind of looking at a magazine

00:19:05.444 --> 00:19:08.013 line:95%,end
that they got
so they're dancing with a magazine

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.649 line:95%,end
and just ogling over this girl
that they wish that they could

00:19:10.716 --> 00:19:11.817 line:95%,end
have as a girlfriend.

00:19:12.618 --> 00:19:15.187 line:95%,end
But it's got to be stage personality.

00:19:15.254 --> 00:19:16.388 line:95%,end
Keep motivated.

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:31.370 line:95%,end
(SINGING) --quite like you.

00:19:32.437 --> 00:19:34.473 line:95%,end
Do the things you do--

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:38.410 line:95%,end
Even though our team has just
come together

00:19:38.544 --> 00:19:40.746 line:95%,end
there's already a bond,
there's already unity.

00:19:40.812 --> 00:19:42.948 line:95%,end
I like the boys, they like me.

00:19:43.015 --> 00:19:46.818 line:95%,end
But overall it's kind of fun
to be surrounded by dance dads

00:19:46.885 --> 00:19:49.254 line:95%,end
so I'm just feeling confident now.

00:19:49.321 --> 00:19:53.458 line:95%,end
Okay, so it looked good did it look great?

00:19:53.525 --> 00:19:55.294 line:95%,end
- No.
- No, not even close.

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:58.197 line:95%,end
It looked better by a tenth of a point.

00:19:59.364 --> 00:20:00.399 line:95%,end
It looks better.

00:20:00.465 --> 00:20:02.568 line:95%,end
- I get it.
- Yeah. Good. I'm glad you get it.

00:20:02.634 --> 00:20:05.971 line:95%,end
I want you guys to go have lunch
and I want you to get filled

00:20:06.038 --> 00:20:07.973 line:95%,end
back up and once you come back in here

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.809 line:95%,end
to work harder than you did this morning.

00:20:10.876 --> 00:20:12.077 line:95%,end
- All right.
- Okay.

00:20:12.144 --> 00:20:13.278 line:95%,end
Mm-hmm.

So you're excited to be back?

00:20:22.521 --> 00:20:24.723 line:5%,start
- What do you think about the solo?
- I like it.

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:25.958 line:5%,start
You like it.

00:20:26.024 --> 00:20:28.193 line:5%,start
When we arrived I found out that
Abby wanted to give Sophia solo.

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:30.128 line:95%,end
I knew that she could
pick up the choreography

00:20:30.195 --> 00:20:31.330 line:95%,end
and that she'd be fine.

00:20:31.396 --> 00:20:33.532 line:95%,end
But I was worried that if Abby
did give her one that there

00:20:33.699 --> 00:20:36.735 line:95%,end
would be tension
and I didn't want to have that.

00:20:36.802 --> 00:20:38.370 line:95%,end
Hey Soph, you know how Abby says she's

00:20:38.437 --> 00:20:41.640 line:95%,end
going to tell the moms about
what was going on the solos

00:20:41.707 --> 00:20:44.643 line:95%,end
how somebody is not going
to have a solo this week

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:46.478 line:95%,end
and she gave it to you.

00:20:46.545 --> 00:20:48.146 line:95%,end
I know it's like really uncomfortable

00:20:48.213 --> 00:20:51.350 line:95%,end
because we normally would
never do that, like ever.

00:20:51.416 --> 00:20:55.153 line:95%,end
So just let Abby handle it
and I don't know who she's taking it

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:57.489 line:95%,end
away from and I feel awful.

00:20:57.556 --> 00:20:59.625 line:95%,end
So whenever we find out
make sure

00:20:59.691 --> 00:21:03.462 line:95%,end
that you go over and you say I'm sorry
and I don't know

00:21:03.562 --> 00:21:05.497 line:95%,end
just try to make the best of it.

00:21:05.564 --> 00:21:06.598 line:95%,end
- Okay.
- Okay?

00:21:06.665 --> 00:21:07.666 line:95%,end
Okay.

00:21:07.766 --> 00:21:10.302 line:95%,end
I Know I just want you to
be not concerned

00:21:10.402 --> 00:21:12.004 line:95%,end
about winning or losing,
just doing your best.

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:17.109 line:95%,end
I never cared about using it's usually
about me trying my best.

All right. Let's go stretch, Soph.
Come on.

Want to go in the room?
I'll walk you in.

It's another day.

Oh I know.

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:33.659 line:95%,end
I can't believe she's
letting her sit down--

00:21:33.725 --> 00:21:34.860 line:95%,end
sit there pigeon toed.

00:21:35.394 --> 00:21:36.828 line:5%,start
Hop it down.

Circle, circle.
Whoop, down.

Nia's been scaring me
recently about her feet.

This time it just like she just has been
complaining about one foot.

00:21:46.505 --> 00:21:47.906 line:95%,end
Said it hurt a lot the other day.

00:21:47.973 --> 00:21:50.942 line:95%,end
Not excruciating that she couldn't dance--

00:21:51.009 --> 00:21:52.010 line:95%,end
When's this started?

00:21:54.079 --> 00:21:55.180 line:95%,end
The moment I really started noticing

00:21:55.247 --> 00:21:57.749 line:5%,start
was really after that competition.

00:21:58.517 --> 00:22:00.719 line:5%,start
As a mom, you could just tell
when something's a little off

00:22:00.786 --> 00:22:02.988 line:5%,start
with your child
and I can see Nia's favoring

00:22:03.055 --> 00:22:05.791 line:95%,end
one foot over the author
since the last dance competition.

Is she?

00:22:09.194 --> 00:22:10.929 line:95%,end
I don't get how
she returns your phone call

but doesn't return mine.

00:22:12.331 --> 00:22:14.533 line:95%,end
When you had an argument
with her you at least--


00:22:14.599 --> 00:22:17.035 line:95%,end
you like said something smart
back to her like

00:22:17.102 --> 00:22:18.837 line:95%,end
don't talk to me that way or something.

00:22:18.904 --> 00:22:20.172 line:95%,end
I sat there.

00:22:20.238 --> 00:22:22.407 line:95%,end
Maybe she just sees
it as this is business.

00:22:22.474 --> 00:22:24.810 line:95%,end
I think Christi--
I think Christi separates the two.

00:22:24.876 --> 00:22:28.313 line:95%,end
Like business is business
and friendship is friendship.

00:22:28.647 --> 00:22:30.582 line:95%,end
I'm mad Christi hasn't called me back.

00:22:30.649 --> 00:22:34.953 line:5%,start
I keep reaching out to her
and I get nothing and it hurts.

00:22:36.254 --> 00:22:37.923 line:95%,end
Hi, guys, how are you?

00:22:37.989 --> 00:22:39.925 line:95%,end
- Hi, how are you?
- Hello. Good.

00:22:39.991 --> 00:22:41.893 line:95%,end
How are you guys.
Where's Jill?

00:22:42.728 --> 00:22:45.230 line:95%,end
She just went down to see Kendall or Abby.

00:22:45.297 --> 00:22:46.431 line:95%,end
I want to know what went on

00:22:46.498 --> 00:22:48.200 line:95%,end
with Kendall coming into this room.

00:22:48.266 --> 00:22:49.301 line:95%,end
I sent her in.

00:22:49.368 --> 00:22:50.502 line:95%,end
Maddie's number's completed

00:22:50.569 --> 00:22:52.304 line:95%,end
Kendall has 40 seconds into hers.

00:22:52.371 --> 00:22:54.206 line:5%,start
Maddie always gets more rehearsal time

00:22:54.272 --> 00:22:56.074 line:5%,start
it's just a given.

00:22:56.141 --> 00:22:58.110 line:5%,start
Always did and always will.

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:00.579 line:95%,end
Her number could be finished already

00:23:00.645 --> 00:23:03.548 line:95%,end
if we didn't have to go over things
and over things and over things.

00:23:03.615 --> 00:23:05.617 line:95%,end
Abby don't go there,
she'll learn the number

00:23:05.684 --> 00:23:07.719 line:95%,end
and she'll do it
to the best of her ability.

00:23:07.786 --> 00:23:09.654 line:5%,start
This is a big week for Kendall.

00:23:09.721 --> 00:23:12.157 line:5%,start
She's on top of the pyramid the same week

00:23:12.224 --> 00:23:15.160 line:95%,end
that Maddie gets a solo,
Sophia comes back,

00:23:15.861 --> 00:23:17.863 line:95%,end
and we're going up against Cathy.

00:23:17.929 --> 00:23:21.333 line:95%,end
It's too much pressure
for Kendall and it shows.

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:23.001 line:95%,end
She's just good Jill, give the kid credit.

00:23:23.068 --> 00:23:25.537 line:95%,end
- I know she's good. She's smart.
- She's smart.

00:23:25.604 --> 00:23:27.706 line:95%,end
I know and guess what? So is Kendall.

00:23:27.773 --> 00:23:31.276 line:95%,end
Well, then Kendall, I'm telling you once,
you do it wrong, do it wrong on stage.

00:23:31.343 --> 00:23:34.079 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:23:34.146 --> 00:23:35.414 line:95%,end
How'd that go?

00:23:35.914 --> 00:23:36.948 line:95%,end
Yeah. Not good.

00:23:37.015 --> 00:23:38.717 line:95%,end
It's a lost cause.

00:23:38.784 --> 00:23:40.085 line:95%,end
She said this would be done.

00:23:40.585 --> 00:23:43.155 line:95%,end
Maddie's done
because she remembered it the first time.

00:23:43.221 --> 00:23:45.457 line:95%,end
Oh, she's full [bleep]
That's just [bleep].

00:23:45.524 --> 00:23:47.259 line:95%,end
You know what she said she's just smart.

00:23:47.325 --> 00:23:49.961 line:95%,end
She thinks all of our kids
are idiots except for Maddie

00:23:50.028 --> 00:23:51.596 line:95%,end
and that's not fair.

00:23:52.597 --> 00:23:54.499 line:95%,end
We all know she's not Maddie.

00:23:55.867 --> 00:23:57.302 line:95%,end
Kendall we're going
to finish your dance with time.

00:23:57.369 --> 00:23:58.503 line:95%,end
Oh, crying again.

00:23:59.604 --> 00:24:01.139 line:95%,end
The baby, the baby of the group.

00:24:01.206 --> 00:24:02.774 line:95%,end
I thought it was MacKenzie, it's you.

00:24:03.074 --> 00:24:04.276 line:95%,end
Don't call her a baby.

00:24:04.576 --> 00:24:06.478 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:24:07.846 --> 00:24:08.914 line:95%,end
Don't cry.

00:24:09.514 --> 00:24:10.649 line:95%,end
Don't cry.

00:24:11.383 --> 00:24:13.852 line:95%,end
You know what I can't have
a kid crying doing a solo.

00:24:13.919 --> 00:24:15.987 line:95%,end
There's no way. I'm not going--

00:24:16.054 --> 00:24:18.757 line:95%,end
I'm not teaching you
it's disrespectful to me.

00:24:19.391 --> 00:24:23.261 line:95%,end
You got a solo, other people didn't
and you're boohooing,

00:24:23.328 --> 00:24:25.964 line:95%,end
it's ridiculous, ridiculous.

00:24:26.031 --> 00:24:28.567 line:95%,end
Why is she crying? What happened?
Was she involved in all this?

00:24:28.633 --> 00:24:30.235 line:95%,end
Why is she crying? Are you kidding me?

00:24:30.302 --> 00:24:33.472 line:95%,end
Did you hear all the [bleep]
I just told you Abby said?

00:24:33.538 --> 00:24:35.040 line:95%,end
Right here boom, boom.

00:24:35.106 --> 00:24:36.741 line:95%,end
Get yourself together.

00:24:37.609 --> 00:24:40.979 line:95%,end
Okay so you just what giggle,
giggle, all change.

00:24:42.948 --> 00:24:44.583 line:95%,end
- I don't like this.
- I know.

00:24:44.649 --> 00:24:46.818 line:95%,end
I'm really sorry
I don't know what just happened

00:24:46.885 --> 00:24:48.220 line:95%,end
but she just left crying.

00:24:48.286 --> 00:24:51.089 line:95%,end
Jackie clearly is not used
to Abby's methods of teaching.

00:24:51.156 --> 00:24:53.658 line:95%,end
When Abby was yelling at Kendall
you could see

00:24:53.725 --> 00:24:57.262 line:95%,end
that Jackie was uncomfortable
and maybe that's why

00:24:57.329 --> 00:25:00.232 line:95%,end
Jackie and Sophia aren't here all the time
they just can't take it.

00:25:04.202 --> 00:25:06.004 line:95%,end
Let's go, we're going on to the group.

00:25:06.838 --> 00:25:08.073 line:95%,end
Maddie move out, move out.

00:25:08.139 --> 00:25:09.708 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:25:10.842 --> 00:25:12.210 line:95%,end
They look like skiers.

00:25:13.712 --> 00:25:14.946 line:95%,end
Yeah, what are they supposed to be?

00:25:15.013 --> 00:25:17.549 line:95%,end
How can they be frozen blue
if they've hats on?

00:25:17.616 --> 00:25:21.253 line:95%,end
Now, listen to me, Sophia,
we'll be doing a solo.

00:25:21.319 --> 00:25:23.088 line:95%,end
They don't know you.
They haven't seen you.

00:25:23.855 --> 00:25:25.557 line:95%,end
Cathy doesn't know anything about you,

00:25:26.057 --> 00:25:27.592 line:95%,end
but I only entered two solos.

00:25:28.727 --> 00:25:33.098 line:95%,end
So Maddie or Kendall
might not be doing a solo.

00:25:33.164 --> 00:25:34.833 line:95%,end
I'm not doing it, I'm done.
Uh-uh.

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:36.835 line:95%,end
I'm not playing her stupid game.

00:25:36.902 --> 00:25:38.236 line:95%,end
It's stupid.

00:25:38.303 --> 00:25:41.973 line:95%,end
She gave Kendall zero chance to look good.

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:43.742 line:95%,end
She gave her five minutes
in there and screamed at her

00:25:43.808 --> 00:25:45.477 line:95%,end
and made her cry.

00:25:45.544 --> 00:25:46.611 line:95%,end
Are you kidding me?

00:25:46.678 --> 00:25:49.381 line:95%,end
She thinks I'm a freaking idiot.


00:25:54.853 --> 00:25:57.222 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:26:00.125 --> 00:26:03.962 line:95%,end
Oh, my gosh, there's so many
pretty things in here to look at.

00:26:04.029 --> 00:26:07.165 line:95%,end
Did you know that Gino
has a solo this weekend?

00:26:07.933 --> 00:26:10.035 line:95%,end
- Yeah.
- How do you think he's going to do?

00:26:10.101 --> 00:26:11.102 line:95%,end
Good.

00:26:11.202 --> 00:26:12.571 line:95%,end
Who do you think is the best dancer?

00:26:12.637 --> 00:26:15.674 line:95%,end
- Probably him and Zack.
- You think him and Zack.

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:18.376 line:95%,end
- What do you think about the theme?
- I like it, it's cool.

00:26:18.443 --> 00:26:21.479 line:95%,end
What do you think about boys
trying to chase a girl?

00:26:21.546 --> 00:26:24.149 line:95%,end
That's funny, huh?
Yeah, I like the theme though.

00:26:24.215 --> 00:26:25.417 line:95%,end
Here. Let's sit down.

00:26:25.483 --> 00:26:26.818 line:5%,start
Going into the competition

00:26:26.885 --> 00:26:30.255 line:5%,start
I know that not only do we have
to beat Abby

00:26:30.322 --> 00:26:32.724 line:95%,end
but we also have to beat her popularity.

00:26:32.791 --> 00:26:36.227 line:95%,end
Don't you think it's kind of stupid
that the boys are just pretending

00:26:36.294 --> 00:26:38.630 line:95%,end
that there's a girl
why not get a girl

00:26:38.697 --> 00:26:41.333 line:95%,end
it's not like we don't have a whole dance
studio full of girls, right?

00:26:41.399 --> 00:26:43.001 line:95%,end
- Yeah.
- You wouldn't want to do it, would you?

00:26:43.068 --> 00:26:44.202 line:95%,end
No.

00:26:46.071 --> 00:26:47.305 line:95%,end
No, I don't think so.

00:26:47.806 --> 00:26:49.741 line:95%,end
- Who do you think I could use?
- Ayla.

00:26:49.808 --> 00:26:52.410 line:95%,end
Ayla. That's a bright idea.

00:26:53.478 --> 00:26:56.448 line:95%,end
Yeah. She would be perfect.

00:26:56.514 --> 00:26:58.783 line:95%,end
I like your idea, you're so smart.

00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:02.721 line:95%,end
Even though Vivi isn't a woman
of many words

00:27:02.787 --> 00:27:05.890 line:95%,end
I can tell whether
she likes something or she doesn't.

00:27:05.957 --> 00:27:08.293 line:95%,end
With Gino doing a solo
this week

00:27:08.927 --> 00:27:14.933 line:95%,end
who are you hoping that he has to compete
against Chloe or Maddie?

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.001 line:95%,end
Maddie.

00:27:16.067 --> 00:27:18.003 line:95%,end
I know that Maddie is a good turner

00:27:18.069 --> 00:27:22.440 line:95%,end
but I don't think that she can do
seven or eight turns like Gino can.

00:27:22.507 --> 00:27:23.675 line:95%,end
No.

00:27:23.742 --> 00:27:25.577 line:95%,end
Geese, I wonder
if there's something in here

00:27:25.644 --> 00:27:27.245 line:95%,end
we could buy for Abby

00:27:27.312 --> 00:27:30.882 line:95%,end
she was so baring with gifts
the last time we saw her.

00:27:31.349 --> 00:27:34.052 line:95%,end
I want to beat Abby that's my goal

00:27:34.119 --> 00:27:38.456 line:95%,end
and I'm going to do and use
every resource that I have

00:27:38.523 --> 00:27:39.958 line:95%,end
to see that that happens.

00:27:40.025 --> 00:27:42.360 line:5%,start
Maybe we can find her
a cheap piece of jewelry.

00:27:44.663 --> 00:27:46.364 line:5%,start
[music playing]

00:27:48.299 --> 00:27:52.237 line:5%,start
Oh, you better get that
touched down on that lunge, Nia.

00:27:55.306 --> 00:27:57.542 line:95%,end
Way down, way down
so she can see your face.

00:27:57.609 --> 00:27:58.810 line:95%,end
Yeah, her face.

00:27:58.877 --> 00:28:01.780 line:95%,end
All right.
Ladies, our team is getting really small.

00:28:01.846 --> 00:28:03.448 line:95%,end
It can't be us.

00:28:03.515 --> 00:28:05.450 line:95%,end
I think if Jackie and Sophia
left it's a problem

00:28:05.517 --> 00:28:07.152 line:95%,end
because of a job.

00:28:08.353 --> 00:28:09.821 line:95%,end
Or maybe they're just late.

00:28:09.888 --> 00:28:11.056 line:95%,end
Here we are getting ready to leave

00:28:11.122 --> 00:28:13.992 line:5%,start
and there's no Jackie and Sophia.
Where are they?

00:28:14.059 --> 00:28:15.493 line:5%,start
If she knew she was leaving
last night

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:16.895 line:95%,end
why wouldn't she say goodbye?

00:28:17.462 --> 00:28:19.464 line:95%,end
She doesn't really belong here.

00:28:19.798 --> 00:28:21.566 line:95%,end
I still don't understand it. I--

00:28:21.633 --> 00:28:23.802 line:95%,end
Jackie was very uncomfortable
with the situation.

00:28:23.868 --> 00:28:25.770 line:95%,end
The baby crying again.

00:28:25.837 --> 00:28:28.373 line:95%,end
I don't like this. I don't.
I'm really sorry.

00:28:29.007 --> 00:28:30.308 line:95%,end
It was evident.

00:28:30.375 --> 00:28:33.144 line:95%,end
She was like I don't do this.

00:28:33.211 --> 00:28:35.113 line:95%,end
Why would she?
She doesn't have to.

00:28:36.381 --> 00:28:37.916 line:95%,end
This isn't her studio.

00:28:38.349 --> 00:28:39.617 line:95%,end
No.

00:28:41.319 --> 00:28:43.555 line:95%,end
Don't loose your face, Nia,
what are you doing there?

00:28:45.657 --> 00:28:47.492 line:95%,end
I think it's a really good duet.

00:28:47.559 --> 00:28:49.360 line:95%,end
I mean it has a lot of personality.

00:28:49.427 --> 00:28:52.497 line:95%,end
Well, Abby initially said
when she was choreographing it.

00:28:52.564 --> 00:28:54.966 line:95%,end
She doesn't like the music.
She doesn't like the style of dance.

00:28:55.033 --> 00:28:57.135 line:95%,end
Basically has disaster
written all over it.

00:28:57.202 --> 00:28:58.603 line:95%,end
Good, good, good, good, good.

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:00.305 line:95%,end
Now your mother came
into the store last night

00:29:00.371 --> 00:29:02.607 line:95%,end
you gave me this big song
and dance about your foot.

00:29:02.674 --> 00:29:05.343 line:95%,end
Do you need to get your foot looked at?
I mean, is it hurt?

00:29:07.846 --> 00:29:11.082 line:95%,end
I know. But what hurts about it, your
ankle or the ball of your foot, your--

00:29:12.183 --> 00:29:13.184 line:95%,end
Your instep.

00:29:13.251 --> 00:29:14.786 line:95%,end
Oh, gosh.

00:29:14.853 --> 00:29:15.854 line:95%,end
Abby MD now.

00:29:16.221 --> 00:29:18.857 line:95%,end
I have to go in there before
she tortures and interrogates this kid.

00:29:18.923 --> 00:29:21.092 line:95%,end
I know. Let me go, excuse me.

00:29:21.159 --> 00:29:22.494 line:95%,end
Do you think you broke something?

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.929 line:95%,end
Hi, I thought I saw you
looking at Nia's foot.

00:29:25.797 --> 00:29:29.334 line:95%,end
I thought I'd just take her quickly
just to get evaluated, just to get--

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:32.137 line:95%,end
Okay, it does look
a little bruised to me right here.

00:29:32.203 --> 00:29:33.438 line:95%,end
Yeah. Look.

00:29:34.739 --> 00:29:37.242 line:95%,end
I don't want you to think
that she can't do the dance.

00:29:37.308 --> 00:29:40.712 line:95%,end
In good conscience, if that foot
is bruised, if it is really injured.

00:29:40.812 --> 00:29:41.880 line:95%,end
Yeah

00:29:41.946 --> 00:29:44.716 line:95%,end
I'm making it worse
and I don't want to be part of that.

00:29:44.783 --> 00:29:45.884 line:95%,end
So I'm dismissing her now.

00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:50.155 line:95%,end
Take her, get me a clearance,
then I'll do it before we get on the bus.

00:29:50.221 --> 00:29:53.858 line:95%,end
Okay. I'll get you that clearance
because I know that's she's fine.

00:29:53.925 --> 00:29:57.729 line:5%,start
This duet with Paige and Nia
is already a hot mess.

00:29:57.796 --> 00:29:59.664 line:95%,end
Now Nia's foot is bothering her

00:29:59.731 --> 00:30:03.268 line:95%,end
and I'm going to add
an injured dancer to the mix, no way.

00:30:03.334 --> 00:30:07.739 line:95%,end
If this routine isn't perfect
and ready to go out there and win

00:30:07.806 --> 00:30:11.242 line:95%,end
I'm not going to do it especially
when we're going up against Cathy.

00:30:13.912 --> 00:30:15.947 line:5%,start
I'm going to the doctor's.

00:30:16.948 --> 00:30:19.117 line:5%,start
Because my foot hurts.

00:30:19.184 --> 00:30:21.119 line:5%,start
Abby said she even sees
a little swelling on her foot.


00:30:21.186 --> 00:30:22.420 line:5%,start
I'm like "Oh, great."

00:30:23.888 --> 00:30:25.290 line:95%,end
Oh, I thought you just--

00:30:25.356 --> 00:30:27.792 line:95%,end
I thought she was like yelling at you.

00:30:27.859 --> 00:30:30.762 line:95%,end
She needs to be cleared
by a doctor, a real doctor.

00:30:30.829 --> 00:30:33.264 line:95%,end
I hope Nia comes back with a clean foot

00:30:33.331 --> 00:30:35.400 line:95%,end
because if she doesn't
we can't do our duet.

00:30:35.466 --> 00:30:37.735 line:95%,end
Well, see you soon. Bye.

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:40.839 line:95%,end
[music playing]

00:30:46.144 --> 00:30:49.781 line:5%,start
Hopefully it won't be a long visit.

00:30:49.848 --> 00:30:52.083 line:5%,start
I decided to take Nia
to the doctor as a precaution

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:54.719 line:5%,start
just to be sure that everything's okay.

00:30:54.786 --> 00:30:58.089 line:95%,end
I think you have to be really clear
about what you're feeling.

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:02.060 line:95%,end
I don't want you to let Paige down.

00:31:02.861 --> 00:31:06.564 line:95%,end
What I think it is I think
you're feeling a little scared.

00:31:06.631 --> 00:31:07.999 line:95%,end
I think you're feeling
a little intimidated

00:31:08.066 --> 00:31:10.268 line:95%,end
and you're second guessing yourself

00:31:10.335 --> 00:31:13.071 line:95%,end
and you're worrying about it
and you can't worry about it.

00:31:13.137 --> 00:31:16.207 line:5%,start
I really hope the doctor says I'm okay
and I can do the duet

00:31:16.274 --> 00:31:20.345 line:5%,start
because I really do want to let Paige down
and I really want to dance.

00:31:20.411 --> 00:31:22.714 line:5%,start
What are you here for today, Nia?

00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:25.250 line:5%,start
Your foot. Which foot is hurting?

00:31:25.316 --> 00:31:27.518 line:5%,start
And how long's it been hurting?

00:31:28.553 --> 00:31:31.823 line:95%,end
- And here? How about back here?
- All of it.

00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:34.659 line:95%,end
All of it hurts when
you're standing on anything?

00:31:34.726 --> 00:31:38.796 line:95%,end
Right. I didn't feel any type of lumps
or anything, so that's good.

00:31:38.863 --> 00:31:41.966 line:95%,end
On a scale of 1 to 10 how bad is the pain?

00:31:43.334 --> 00:31:44.369 line:5%,start
Seven.

00:31:44.435 --> 00:31:47.639 line:95%,end
I do recommend staying off it
as much as possible.

00:31:47.705 --> 00:31:50.141 line:95%,end
I understand she does dance
for a long period of time

00:31:50.208 --> 00:31:52.977 line:95%,end
but she does need to have
time to rest that foot.

00:31:53.044 --> 00:31:57.782 line:95%,end
Hearing the doctor say that Nia
needs to rest her foot more scares me.

00:31:57.849 --> 00:31:59.484 line:95%,end
I didn't think there
was a real injury there

00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:02.620 line:95%,end
but I just hope the doctor clears her
for this weekend's competition.

00:32:02.687 --> 00:32:05.890 line:95%,end
Well, I'm going to write
you a note letting you go back to dance

00:32:05.957 --> 00:32:08.493 line:95%,end
but absolutely stay off of it
as much as you can.

00:32:08.559 --> 00:32:09.560 line:95%,end
When you can.

So we need to finish it, right?

00:32:34.719 --> 00:32:36.888 line:95%,end
So here's what I want to tell you

00:32:36.955 --> 00:32:39.857 line:95%,end
I need to see this face working in it

00:32:39.924 --> 00:32:46.364 line:95%,end
because I get so tired of listening
to the Maddie charm

00:32:46.431 --> 00:32:50.335 line:95%,end
with the face and the Chloe emotion.

00:32:50.401 --> 00:32:56.407 line:95%,end
We need to have that secret pocket weapon
that's also got passion.

00:32:56.474 --> 00:32:59.143 line:95%,end
That's why you're having
a solo this week

00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:03.648 line:95%,end

this amazing animation with your face.

don't, don't want to hear

with a tenth of a point.

You also have to worry about pleasing me.

Of course you know that should
be top on your list, is it?

00:33:20.264 --> 00:33:22.533 line:95%,end
Well, it shouldn't be it should
be at the bottom of the list

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:23.901 line:95%,end
because going out there
and doing the dance

00:33:23.968 --> 00:33:26.437 line:95%,end
correctly should be number one, right?

she by far, class, money--

00:37:30.381 --> 00:37:31.916 line:95%,end
waging a war against me.

00:37:31.983 --> 00:37:33.684 line:95%,end
Nia can go by herself.
That's fine.

00:37:33.751 --> 00:37:36.821 line:95%,end
HOLLY: You know, when I sent her
by herself last season,

00:37:36.887 --> 00:37:38.189 line:95%,end
you grilled me to no end.

00:37:38.256 --> 00:37:40.591 line:95%,end
And I was not only finished, but done.

00:37:40.658 --> 00:37:41.659 line:95%,end
Well done.

00:37:41.726 --> 00:37:44.295 line:95%,end
I think she's immature and I think
she needs to grow up a little bit.

00:37:44.362 --> 00:37:46.697 line:95%,end
You didn't walk in her shoes
when she couldn't walk

00:37:46.764 --> 00:37:47.965 line:95%,end
and she was in a wheelchair.

00:37:48.032 --> 00:37:49.300 line:95%,end
Are we on this feet thing again?

00:37:49.367 --> 00:37:52.203 line:95%,end
We are because that's who she is.

00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:54.805 line:95%,end
She doesn't use that to define her,
she doesn't use it as a crutch.

00:37:54.872 --> 00:37:57.875 line:95%,end
But every now and then
she does have pain, which is real.

00:37:58.376 --> 00:38:00.378 line:95%,end
- But there's no injury.
- It's real.

00:38:00.444 --> 00:38:02.280 line:95%,end
I'm about this far from pulling the duet.

00:38:02.346 --> 00:38:04.582 line:95%,end
HOLLY: No she needs to do
the duet to prove to you

00:38:04.649 --> 00:38:07.351 line:95%,end
that she's capable of dancing.
And dancing well through pain.

00:38:07.418 --> 00:38:09.420 line:95%,end
I know, but your mouth is ugly, woman.

00:38:09.487 --> 00:38:11.656 line:95%,end
You are a monstrosity of evil.

00:38:11.722 --> 00:38:13.424 line:95%,end
You want to talk about ugliness.

00:38:13.491 --> 00:38:15.693 line:95%,end
You're done, you're done.
No duet.

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:17.628 line:95%,end
- Whatever.
- ABBY: I'm a monstrosity of evil?

00:38:17.695 --> 00:38:19.397 line:95%,end
- Yes, you are.
- I'll show you evil.

00:38:20.898 --> 00:38:23.200 line:95%,end
That's your name and reputation.

00:38:23.267 --> 00:38:25.836 line:95%,end
Yeah, I know, evil monstrosity, I got it.

00:38:25.903 --> 00:38:28.372 line:95%,end
I have to do something
to keep these moms in line.

00:38:29.006 --> 00:38:32.843 line:95%,end
Last week, Christi flipped out,
and now Holly is acting up.

00:38:33.611 --> 00:38:36.881 line:95%,end
If there aren't consequences
for their horrible behavior,

00:38:36.947 --> 00:38:38.649 line:95%,end
they're just going to keep doing it.

00:38:38.716 --> 00:38:40.618 line:95%,end
Three years ago I didn't know
if my kid could walk again,


00:38:40.685 --> 00:38:42.053 line:95%,end
let alone dance again.

00:38:43.254 --> 00:38:45.323 line:95%,end
And she's making fun of it,
making a mockery of it.

00:38:45.389 --> 00:38:46.424 line:95%,end
That's wrong.

00:38:47.024 --> 00:38:50.761 line:95%,end
But you know what, Nia has
survived much worse than this.

00:38:50.828 --> 00:38:54.699 line:95%,end
And this would just reflect
on how mean spirited that woman is.

00:38:54.765 --> 00:38:56.801 line:95%,end
Because that's why I'm here
to defend my kid

00:38:56.867 --> 00:38:58.536 line:95%,end
when she acts like a fool.

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:01.138 line:95%,end
Wow.

00:39:02.173 --> 00:39:04.308 line:95%,end
- Where's Abby?
- Not here.

00:39:04.375 --> 00:39:05.743 line:95%,end
Not here, she's mad.

00:39:07.378 --> 00:39:08.646 line:95%,end
Where's Sophia?

00:39:11.182 --> 00:39:13.918 line:95%,end
Oh, and by the way, we're missing someone.

00:39:13.984 --> 00:39:17.054 line:95%,end
Yes, we are, we're missing
a key person in our team.

00:39:17.121 --> 00:39:18.255 line:95%,end
Where is she?

00:39:18.322 --> 00:39:20.257 line:95%,end
JILL: Unfortunately she was suspended.

00:39:20.324 --> 00:39:23.194 line:95%,end
Suspend-- you see parents
the kind of stuff

00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:24.895 line:95%,end
that these poor women put up with?

00:39:24.995 --> 00:39:26.364 line:95%,end
Suspension.

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:29.133 line:95%,end
You know I have fathers
opening doors for me.

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.634 line:95%,end
Our fathers would open
the doors for us too.

00:39:30.701 --> 00:39:32.737 line:95%,end
Well, yeah, you guys
just never bring your fathers.

00:39:33.938 --> 00:39:36.941 line:95%,end
- So, I'm so sorry that Abby's pouting.
- JILL: No, no, she's not pouting.

00:39:37.007 --> 00:39:39.009 line:95%,end
And that you guys are
sitting here threading.

00:39:39.076 --> 00:39:41.912 line:95%,end
- No, this is to sew our hats on.
- This is what dance moms do.

00:39:41.979 --> 00:39:44.348 line:95%,end
- You guys can arrive in limos--
- CATHY: No, wasn't that fun?

00:39:44.415 --> 00:39:45.716 line:95%,end
JILL: --and sit pretty. But that doesn't--

00:39:45.783 --> 00:39:47.017 line:95%,end
Oh, gosh, Jill, wasn't that fun?

00:39:47.084 --> 00:39:48.652 line:95%,end
JILL: --make you a dance mom
or a dance dad.

00:39:48.719 --> 00:39:51.422 line:95%,end
Oh, come on, you know that was fun.

00:39:51.489 --> 00:39:54.492 line:95%,end
- Oh, my gosh, I love your pants.
- Thank you.

00:39:54.558 --> 00:39:55.559 line:95%,end
You look cute.

00:39:55.626 --> 00:39:57.495 line:95%,end
All right, do something
with that hair, Jill.

00:39:57.561 --> 00:39:58.662 line:95%,end
Let's go.

00:40:00.798 --> 00:40:01.966 line:95%,end
She really is pouting.

00:40:03.067 --> 00:40:05.669 line:95%,end
I hate to say it
but we have to beat those kids.

00:40:05.736 --> 00:40:06.837 line:95%,end
We have to.

00:40:06.904 --> 00:40:10.775 line:5%,start
We have to beat Kathy
this week, and by a lot.

00:40:10.841 --> 00:40:13.210 line:95%,end
Not just by a tenth of a point this time.

00:40:13.277 --> 00:40:15.546 line:95%,end
So Kelly, now that you have had your
phone on

00:40:15.613 --> 00:40:17.615 line:95%,end
for a whole day,
have you tried to call Christi again?

00:40:17.681 --> 00:40:20.818 line:95%,end
I've called her three times,
she won't answer my phone calls, I'm done.

00:40:20.885 --> 00:40:22.820 line:95%,end
You said last night you were done,
I just didn't know if you tried again.

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:24.588 line:95%,end
I didn't even do anything.

00:40:24.655 --> 00:40:26.557 line:95%,end
Why should I have to call her?

00:40:26.624 --> 00:40:27.992 line:95%,end
Why are you guys so mad at each other?

00:40:28.058 --> 00:40:30.060 line:95%,end
She obviously doesn't want to talk to me.

00:40:30.127 --> 00:40:32.997 line:95%,end
I'm assuming because I said
about Chloe losing her hat.

00:40:33.998 --> 00:40:35.065 line:95%,end
That's the only thing I did.

00:40:35.132 --> 00:40:36.333 line:95%,end
But are you guys going to be okay?

00:40:37.468 --> 00:40:38.569 line:95%,end
I have no idea.

00:40:39.937 --> 00:40:43.441 line:95%,end
I just thought our friendship
was better than that.

00:40:44.041 --> 00:40:45.543 line:5%,start
I knew something was wrong with Christi

00:40:45.609 --> 00:40:47.945 line:5%,start
when she wasn't returning
my phone calls or my texts.

00:40:48.245 --> 00:40:50.414 line:95%,end
I mean, I thought it was
just because I said something

00:40:50.481 --> 00:40:54.585 line:95%,end
about Chloe dropping her hat,
but maybe it was more than that.

00:40:54.652 --> 00:40:57.555 line:95%,end
Well, we had a little mishap, Miss Paige.

00:40:57.621 --> 00:41:00.458 line:95%,end
Abby and Holly got into an argument

00:41:01.192 --> 00:41:04.495 line:95%,end
and Abby said she's pulling the duet.

00:41:04.562 --> 00:41:06.697 line:95%,end
- But I was ready to do it.
- That's what I told her.

00:41:06.764 --> 00:41:08.265 line:95%,end
I was like, Mia's ready to dance.

00:41:08.332 --> 00:41:11.635 line:95%,end
She's ready to prove to you
that she is fine, and she can dance,

00:41:11.702 --> 00:41:14.405 line:95%,end
and this is why she is walking
and doing what she's doing.

00:41:14.472 --> 00:41:18.108 line:95%,end
I need to talk to Abby and convince her
to let these girls dance.

00:41:18.175 --> 00:41:20.778 line:95%,end
I'm not going let my daughter be punished
for something she didn't do.

00:41:20.845 --> 00:41:22.646 line:95%,end
It's just not fair.

00:41:24.215 --> 00:41:26.917 line:95%,end
Okay, we're all set?

00:41:26.984 --> 00:41:31.789 line:95%,end
Duets pulled, Kendall is on shortly.

00:41:31.856 --> 00:41:33.724 line:95%,end
- Do we really have to pull the duets?
- It's done.

00:41:33.791 --> 00:41:35.659 line:5%,start
It's already finished.

00:41:35.726 --> 00:41:36.994 line:5%,start
No, your mother was rude to me.

00:41:37.061 --> 00:41:39.797 line:95%,end
I'm sorry, it's done. I pulled it, over.

00:41:39.864 --> 00:41:41.665 line:95%,end
I'm not going to be spoken to that way.

00:41:41.732 --> 00:41:44.268 line:95%,end
Not by a man downstairs,
from Cathy and not by you.

00:41:44.335 --> 00:41:46.070 line:95%,end
Abby giveth, Abby taketh away.

00:41:47.037 --> 00:41:48.906 line:95%,end
Nobody is going to speak to me that way.

00:41:48.973 --> 00:41:50.774 line:95%,end
I didn't put up with it from Christi.

00:41:50.841 --> 00:41:52.776 line:95%,end
Tell her to keep it up,
and you'll be suspended.

00:41:52.843 --> 00:41:57.081 line:95%,end
Abby, I am asking you
in a very professional, motherly way,

00:41:57.147 --> 00:41:59.183 line:95%,end
to give Nia back that solo.

00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:01.185 line:95%,end
- No.
- She has earned it, Abby.

00:42:01.252 --> 00:42:03.320 line:95%,end
- And you screwed it up.
- I did not screw it up.

00:42:03.387 --> 00:42:05.122 line:95%,end
- Yes, you did.
- Paige would like to dance.

00:42:05.189 --> 00:42:06.190 line:95%,end
ABBY: I understand, Paige.

00:42:06.257 --> 00:42:08.425 line:95%,end
Sorry, you're a victim
of the circumstances.

00:42:08.492 --> 00:42:10.628 line:95%,end
- You're not doing the duet.
- But you are evil.

00:42:10.694 --> 00:42:13.430 line:95%,end
- That's why I called you evil.
- Okay, come on.

00:42:14.398 --> 00:42:16.367 line:95%,end
- Kendall, are you ready for evil?
- Let's go.

00:42:16.433 --> 00:42:18.402 line:95%,end
This is Kendall's time to shine.

00:42:18.469 --> 00:42:20.938 line:95%,end
I really need for her to focus.

00:42:21.005 --> 00:42:23.340 line:95%,end
And all this business with Cathy,

00:42:23.407 --> 00:42:25.075 line:95%,end
and Abby pulling the duet

00:42:25.142 --> 00:42:27.211 line:95%,end
it's taking away from Kendall's time.

00:42:27.278 --> 00:42:30.981 line:95%,end

so she can stay on top.

Kelly is right. I need to get it together
and not let Abby see me down.

00:45:46.643 --> 00:45:48.879 line:95%,end
She does not have power over me.

00:45:48.946 --> 00:45:50.614 line:95%,end
Come on, let's go talk to her.

00:45:51.381 --> 00:45:54.051 line:5%,start
I did everything I could
to get Holly to calm down

00:45:54.151 --> 00:45:55.853 line:5%,start
and just come back into the green room.

00:45:55.919 --> 00:45:58.489 line:95%,end
And I'm just hoping that
Abby changes her mind

00:45:58.555 --> 00:46:00.491 line:95%,end
and lets the girls do the duet.

00:46:00.557 --> 00:46:02.459 line:95%,end
All right, girls, so we're getting ready,

00:46:03.327 --> 00:46:05.729 line:95%,end
but you still might not be
allowed to do the dance.

00:46:05.796 --> 00:46:09.199 line:95%,end
When Abby comes in,
we're going to ask her to talk to her.

00:46:09.266 --> 00:46:12.436 line:95%,end
You'll probably have to
just go right to stage,

00:46:12.503 --> 00:46:14.872 line:95%,end
so you guys have to be ready, okay?

00:46:14.938 --> 00:46:19.243 line:95%,end
The duet has to be even better
than she expects.

00:46:19.309 --> 00:46:22.946 line:95%,end
Don't give Abby the satisfaction
of even saying I told you so.

00:46:23.013 --> 00:46:27.785 line:95%,end
Show her that you're just
absolutely incredible.


00:46:41.198 --> 00:46:42.499 line:95%,end
Use your face.

00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:48.539 line:5%,start
Make that first left shoulder sharper.

Right and we all agreed, right?

Nobody is your friend

We can not lose to her this week

as to who should be top overall.

No I know it's an intense dance,

Use our brain.

Bring on the acting,
bring on the technique,

It's survival.

your stuff off

No, they're not doing the duet.

don't show you that they want to dance.

If you guys want to be in the group dance,

I suggest you're going
to get those off

00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:05.388 line:95%,end

And it was like the cherry on top
of the sundae to beat Abby.

00:56:52.542 --> 00:56:56.045 line:95%,end
So, Abby, how you feeling?

00:56:56.112 --> 00:56:57.781 line:95%,end
- I'm fabulous.
- Great.

00:56:57.847 --> 00:57:00.417 line:95%,end
It was a great number, fell short though.

00:57:00.483 --> 00:57:03.052 line:95%,end
Let's talk about third place.

00:57:03.119 --> 00:57:04.354 line:95%,end
Let's talk about it.

00:57:04.421 --> 00:57:07.023 line:95%,end
These boys have you rattled.

00:57:07.090 --> 00:57:08.091 line:95%,end
They don't have me rattled.

00:57:08.158 --> 00:57:10.360 line:95%,end
Oh really, then why are you so agitated?

00:57:10.427 --> 00:57:11.828 line:95%,end
Their obnoxious dads do.

00:57:11.895 --> 00:57:14.130 line:95%,end
And you don't have obnoxious moms?

00:57:14.564 --> 00:57:15.832 line:95%,end
Oh, lots.

00:57:16.966 --> 00:57:19.135 line:95%,end
How about your it girl, Kendall?

00:57:19.202 --> 00:57:20.437 line:95%,end
She couldn't even place.

00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:23.773 line:95%,end
I'm still trying to erase
the bad habits she picked up.

00:57:23.873 --> 00:57:26.042 line:95%,end
You know what?
You're going to see more of me.

00:57:26.109 --> 00:57:30.113 line:95%,end
Cathy, let's get this kid
and put her against McKenzie.

00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:32.782 line:95%,end
You know what,
don't you dare talk about that kid.

00:57:32.849 --> 00:57:35.385 line:95%,end
- JILL: I heard you talk about my kid.
- Shut up, Jill.

00:57:35.452 --> 00:57:38.154 line:95%,end
- Don't talk about my kid.
- What you have on doesn't matter.

00:57:38.221 --> 00:57:41.024 line:95%,end
You're rude and disrespectful.
That's why your children left.

00:57:41.090 --> 00:57:43.393 line:95%,end
Now you know how it feels.

00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:46.229 line:95%,end
Let's go, big boy.
You were all mouth before.

00:57:46.663 --> 00:57:48.865 line:95%,end
You're too busy digesting
that crow you had to swallow.

00:57:49.599 --> 00:57:51.668 line:95%,end
Oh I didn't swallow any crow.

00:57:52.135 --> 00:57:54.337 line:95%,end
My child just went out there and won.

00:57:54.404 --> 00:57:57.040 line:95%,end
It doesn't matter.
At the end of the day, you still lost.

00:57:57.106 --> 00:58:00.510 line:95%,end
Who was the little girl
that showed up for 16 counts?

00:58:00.810 --> 00:58:02.612 line:95%,end
Oh I'll go get her for you.

00:58:02.679 --> 00:58:05.849 line:95%,end
I'll let her show you what she can do.

00:58:05.915 --> 00:58:07.150 line:95%,end
Where's Ayla?

00:58:11.187 --> 00:58:12.489 line:95%,end
- So.
- Cathy no one wants you here.

00:58:12.555 --> 00:58:13.723 line:95%,end
Do you think if I throw
this on her the witch--

00:58:13.790 --> 00:58:14.958 line:95%,end
Shut your mouth.

00:58:15.525 --> 00:58:17.260 line:95%,end
Whoa that was good.

00:58:17.327 --> 00:58:18.595 line:95%,end
- No I didn't--
- Let me see.

00:58:18.661 --> 00:58:19.996 line:95%,end
--mean to do that.
I didn't mean to do that.

00:58:20.063 --> 00:58:21.531 line:95%,end
No, really,
I thought the witch would melt.

00:58:21.598 --> 00:58:23.132 line:95%,end
No, really, I apologize.

00:58:23.199 --> 00:58:24.801 line:95%,end
- I didn't even know the lid was off.
- You know what?

00:58:24.868 --> 00:58:26.603 line:95%,end
Because I didn't mean to do that either.

00:58:28.571 --> 00:58:31.074 line:95%,end
If Christi can come after me.

00:58:32.041 --> 00:58:33.476 line:95%,end
Oh my God. You are such--

00:58:33.543 --> 00:58:34.644 line:95%,end
You gonna hit me with your purse?

00:58:34.711 --> 00:58:35.912 line:95%,end
--a [bleep] bitch.

00:58:35.979 --> 00:58:37.113 line:95%,end
Oh please.


00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:38.481 line:95%,end
Fight!

00:58:38.548 --> 00:58:40.350 line:95%,end
JILL: Come on, bring it on bitch.

00:58:40.416 --> 00:58:42.552 line:95%,end
- Don't do it.
- ABBY: That woman just hit me.

00:58:42.619 --> 00:58:44.921 line:95%,end
- [gasp]
- Go ahead, water doesn't hurt me.

00:58:44.988 --> 00:58:46.589 line:95%,end
- Grow up.
- You grow up.

00:58:46.656 --> 00:58:47.857 line:95%,end
- And get a life.
- You are such--

00:58:47.957 --> 00:58:52.362 line:95%,end
And don't say anything
about my childhood ever again.

00:58:52.428 --> 00:58:53.563 line:95%,end
Come here, chill.

00:58:53.630 --> 00:58:54.631 line:95%,end
You don't deserve to--

00:58:54.697 --> 00:58:56.165 line:95%,end
Shut your mouth.

00:58:56.232 --> 00:58:58.334 line:95%,end
--look at her with those
disgusting eyes of yours.

00:58:58.401 --> 00:59:00.737 line:95%,end
You're so two-bit Jill,
it's not even funny.

00:59:00.803 --> 00:59:02.238 line:95%,end
Get lost, bitch.

00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:05.542 line:95%,end
Whoo.

00:59:08.344 --> 00:59:09.479 line:95%,end
Oh, my God.

00:59:09.546 --> 00:59:12.482 line:95%,end
She is low class dirt.

00:59:13.917 --> 00:59:14.951 line:95%,end
Dirt.

00:59:15.451 --> 00:59:19.923 line:95%,end
I have lost to her,
I don't know how many times.

00:59:19.989 --> 00:59:24.894 line:95%,end
And I win big,
and not a tenth of a point, one time.

00:59:24.961 --> 00:59:30.300 line:95%,end
And I end up with water,
and being screamed and yelled at,

00:59:30.433 --> 00:59:31.668 line:95%,end
and drenched.

00:59:31.734 --> 00:59:34.837 line:95%,end
They are the worst losers
that there could possibly be.

00:59:34.904 --> 00:59:37.206 line:95%,end
She's screaming at you,
be thankful you don't have her

00:59:37.273 --> 00:59:38.308 line:95%,end
as a teacher.

00:59:38.374 --> 00:59:41.144 line:95%,end
Be thankful you guys don't
have her as a teacher.

00:59:41.711 --> 00:59:42.779 line:95%,end
You know something?

00:59:42.845 --> 00:59:44.781 line:95%,end
She's going down the next time,
and the next time,

00:59:44.881 --> 00:59:46.015 line:95%,end
and the next time.

00:59:46.082 --> 00:59:48.251 line:95%,end
The next time, I'm using Aqua Net.

00:59:49.819 --> 00:59:51.354 line:95%,end
[cheering]

00:59:54.591 --> 00:59:57.827 line:95%,end
Can I get it, can I get--
what's up, aye, boy, come here.

01:00:00.029 --> 01:00:01.798 line:95%,end
Yes, we did it.

01:00:02.699 --> 01:00:05.835 line:95%,end
You guys are official top overall winners.

01:00:05.902 --> 01:00:07.103 line:95%,end
Beating Abby Lee!

01:00:07.170 --> 01:00:09.172 line:95%,end
[cheering]

01:00:09.238 --> 01:00:11.174 line:95%,end
We need to hear the chant, and loudly.

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:13.376 line:95%,end
Ready!
Who are we?

01:00:13.443 --> 01:00:15.945 line:95%,end
ALL: Apple Core, Apple Core, Apple Core!

01:00:16.012 --> 01:00:17.013 line:95%,end
Who are we?

01:00:17.113 --> 01:00:19.549 line:95%,end
ALL: Apple Core, Apple Core, Apple Core!

01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:20.783 line:95%,end
Yes.

01:00:27.757 --> 01:00:30.994 line:95%,end
Sometimes people just cross the line.

01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:32.428 line:95%,end
Cathy crossed the line.

01:00:33.029 --> 01:00:35.465 line:95%,end
It's been a rough day and I've had enough.

01:00:41.371 --> 01:00:42.872 line:95%,end
JILL: I see that, yeah.

01:00:47.844 --> 01:00:49.145 line:95%,end
ABBY: Hi.

01:00:50.913 --> 01:00:52.949 line:5%,start
So your blood, sit.

01:00:53.016 --> 01:00:54.784 line:5%,start
I just put kids onstage.

01:00:55.418 --> 01:00:57.086 line:5%,start
This is ridiculous.

01:00:58.521 --> 01:00:59.922 line:5%,start
I've never seen Abby like this.

01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:02.725 line:5%,start
I think losing to Cathy really got to her.

01:01:04.994 --> 01:01:06.729 line:95%,end
Abby, your blood pressure,
I'm just worried

01:01:06.796 --> 01:01:08.164 line:95%,end
she's going to have a heart attack.

01:01:09.065 --> 01:01:12.602 line:95%,end
I got in a fight with a man
earlier who was belligerent.

01:01:12.669 --> 01:01:16.372 line:95%,end
Now I come and this woman Kathy comes in.

01:01:16.439 --> 01:01:19.409 line:95%,end
First she brings three men
into the dressing room,

01:01:19.475 --> 01:01:20.810 line:95%,end
which I don't appreciate.

01:01:20.877 --> 01:01:23.279 line:95%,end
And then she whacks me with a purse.

01:01:23.346 --> 01:01:25.114 line:95%,end
Then I came in my dressing room
and got in a fight

01:01:25.181 --> 01:01:27.750 line:95%,end
with my own student and her mother Holly.

01:01:28.618 --> 01:01:31.521 line:5%,start
What goes around comes around,
and karma's there

01:01:31.587 --> 01:01:32.689 line:5%,start
when you need it.

01:01:32.755 --> 01:01:34.791 line:95%,end
ABBY: So it's been a long day.

01:01:34.857 --> 01:01:36.759 line:95%,end
I was in the wrong, I know that.

01:01:36.826 --> 01:01:38.227 line:95%,end
I've had it.

01:01:41.597 --> 01:01:43.766 line:95%,end
I've had it, I'm finished.

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:45.702 line:95%,end
[dramatic music]

01:01:53.576 --> 01:01:54.944 line:95%,end
ABBY (VOICEOVER): Next on Dance Moms.

01:01:55.311 --> 01:01:58.347 line:5%,start
Yo blondie, you were gone for a week.

01:01:58.414 --> 01:02:01.184 line:5%,start
You know what?
My daughter has a name.

01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:02.752 line:5%,start
How about if you just shut your mouth?

01:02:03.753 --> 01:02:05.188 line:5%,start
[music playing]

01:02:10.093 --> 01:02:11.394 line:5%,start
I told Christi I would talk to her,

01:02:11.461 --> 01:02:12.628 line:5%,start
I want to talk to her in private.

01:02:12.695 --> 01:02:15.498 line:5%,start
All I know, is when
Kelly has had bad times,

01:02:15.565 --> 01:02:17.133 line:5%,start
I've been the first one
to stick up for her.

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:19.569 line:5%,start
If you can't answer my
phone calls, then [bleep] you.

01:02:19.635 --> 01:02:21.137 line:5%,start
[bleep] you.
