Welcome to the "Dance Moms
Christmas Special."

00:00:04.104 --> 00:00:05.705 line:95%,end
'Twas the night before Christmas.

00:00:05.772 --> 00:00:08.074 line:95%,end
It's perfectly clear, the
Abby Lee Dance Company

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:09.843 line:95%,end
has nothing to fear.

00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:11.611 line:95%,end
Do you have a naughty or nice list?

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:12.746 line:95%,end
Oh, yes.

00:00:12.812 --> 00:00:14.280 line:95%,end
Let's open it! Nia?

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:17.150 line:95%,end
Oh, my God. Thank you.

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:18.685 line:95%,end
JEFF COLLINS: We have
our amazing dancers here

00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:21.554 line:95%,end
from the Abby Lee Dance Company,
and Santa's been spotted.

00:00:21.621 --> 00:00:23.323 line:95%,end
[yelling]

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.225 line:95%,end
DANCE MOM: Oh, my God.

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:26.693 line:95%,end
JILL VERTES: She's the ugly stepsister.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.262 line:95%,end
Sooner or later, she's going
to end up with egg on her face.

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:31.197 line:95%,end
Don't you think?
- How dare you!

00:00:31.264 --> 00:00:33.533 line:95%,end
[THEME - NIKKO LOWE, "LIVING ON
THE DANCE FLOOR"]

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.868 line:95%,end
(SINGING) Get up.

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:37.137 line:95%,end
Get on the floor.

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:39.873 line:95%,end
My world is with my girls.

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:42.075 line:95%,end
Living on the dance floor.

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:44.511 line:95%,end
[festive music]

00:00:44.577 --> 00:00:45.645 line:95%,end
So switch the blue--

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:46.980 line:95%,end
DANCER: (SINGING) Oh, Christmas tree.

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:48.715 line:95%,end
Ladies! What are you doing?

00:00:48.782 --> 00:00:49.816 line:95%,end
Decorating.

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:51.818 line:95%,end
Straighten that star out!
Take that blue ball!

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:53.987 line:95%,end
Move it 2 inches to the left!

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:56.022 line:95%,end
- Right here.
- Girls, stop.

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:57.323 line:95%,end
Don't touch the tree.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.659 line:95%,end
Just go get ready to dance, please?

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:01.661 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:02.729 line:95%,end
Bye, girls.

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:07.233 line:5%,start
Hi, and welcome to the
"Dance Moms Christmas Special."

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.169 line:5%,start
I'm executive producer Jeff Collins.

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:11.337 line:95%,end
We have our amazing dancers
here from the Abby Lee Dance

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:13.039 line:95%,end
Company, and they're
going to be performing

00:01:13.106 --> 00:01:14.374 line:95%,end
throughout the night.

00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:16.476 line:95%,end
We'll also have a
special guest performance

00:01:16.543 --> 00:01:17.844 line:95%,end
by the incredibly talented--

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:20.180 line:95%,end
Coco Jones is here.

00:01:21.314 --> 00:01:24.951 line:95%,end
And Santa's been spotted
on a radar 45 minutes away.

00:01:25.018 --> 00:01:27.987 line:95%,end
But before he gets here,
the "Dance Moms" are going to pay a visit,

00:01:28.054 --> 00:01:30.256 line:95%,end
and we'll also get to meet a few
of the dance dads.

00:01:30.323 --> 00:01:32.258 line:95%,end
But first, let's kick off our special

00:01:32.325 --> 00:01:35.695 line:95%,end
with our own dance diva,
Miss Abby Lee Miller.

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:37.030 line:95%,end
Merry Christmas, Abby.

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:38.164 line:95%,end
Marry Christmas to you, Jeff.

00:01:38.231 --> 00:01:39.999 line:5%,start
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:41.835 line:5%,start
I'm thrilled to be here.

00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:44.270 line:95%,end
We're going to bring out the "Dance Moms"
here in just a moment.

00:01:44.337 --> 00:01:46.339 line:95%,end
But first, Abby, I want to
ask you, what does Christmas

00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:47.574 line:95%,end
mean to you?

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.210 line:95%,end
Christmas means two weeks
off from the dance studio.

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:51.544 line:95%,end
JEFF COLLINS: [laughs]

00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:52.846 line:95%,end
OK--

00:01:52.912 --> 00:01:55.782 line:95%,end
No moms, no kids, no complaining.

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:57.750 line:95%,end
JEFF COLLINS: It wouldn't be Christmas
with somebody not complaining.

00:01:57.817 --> 00:01:59.652 line:95%,end
I should say, it wouldn't
be a "Dance Moms" Christmas

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:00.920 line:95%,end
without someone complaining.

00:02:00.987 --> 00:02:06.459 line:95%,end
Right. But Christmas really
is my time to kind of destress.

00:02:06.526 --> 00:02:09.562 line:95%,end
Now one of the things that we did to make
you feel special is we put photographs

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.897 line:95%,end
all around the set of your family.

00:02:10.997 --> 00:02:12.332 line:95%,end
So take us back.

00:02:12.398 --> 00:02:14.734 line:95%,end
What was it like in your house
when you were a little girl?

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:18.204 line:95%,end
Christmas morning for
me was my mom, my dad,

00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:22.775 line:95%,end
and opening all my
gifts, being so excited,

00:02:22.842 --> 00:02:24.944 line:95%,end
wanting to play, and then my mother,

00:02:25.011 --> 00:02:26.913 line:95%,end
being the devout Catholic that she is,

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.649 line:95%,end
saying, nope, we have to go to mass.

00:02:29.716 --> 00:02:31.451 line:95%,end
I'm embarrassed as an adult to say this,

00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:35.255 line:95%,end
but I think I screamed and cried
and kicked and had a little bit

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:38.958 line:95%,end
of a tantrum, because all the
other kids in the neighborhood

00:02:39.025 --> 00:02:40.927 line:95%,end
were playing with their toys.

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:43.296 line:95%,end
So Abby Lee Miller had a tantrum.

00:02:43.363 --> 00:02:44.964 line:95%,end
So basically nothing's changed?

00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:47.100 line:95%,end
No.

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:49.936 line:95%,end
So before we get to our moms,
I want to ask about your mom.

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:51.004 line:95%,end
How's she doing?

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.239 line:95%,end
She is still kicking.

00:02:53.306 --> 00:02:54.974 line:95%,end
JEFF COLLINS: Yeah?
- Yes.

00:02:55.041 --> 00:02:56.843 line:95%,end
Well, listen, our
prayers are with you both.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:57.944 line:95%,end
- Thank you.
- We hope you have a very--

00:02:58.011 --> 00:02:59.145 line:95%,end
- Thank you
- --Merry Christmas.

00:02:59.212 --> 00:03:01.181 line:95%,end
I suspect you're going
to be in Pittsburgh?

00:03:01.247 --> 00:03:02.482 line:95%,end
- We are in Pittsburgh.
- Right.

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:03.650 line:95%,end
She's at home now.

00:03:03.716 --> 00:03:06.653 line:95%,end
And we hopefully will
have a fabulous holiday.

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:07.987 line:95%,end
Well, good.

00:03:08.054 --> 00:03:10.023 line:95%,end
So did your mom have a
naughty or nice list?

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:11.658 line:95%,end
No, no.

00:03:11.724 --> 00:03:12.992 line:95%,end
Do you?

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:14.360 line:95%,end
Oh, yes.

00:03:14.427 --> 00:03:15.461 line:95%,end
JEFF COLLINS: I thought so.

00:03:15.528 --> 00:03:20.099 line:95%,end
I have a big naughty list and maybe--

00:03:20.166 --> 00:03:22.435 line:95%,end
A little, tiny nice list?

00:03:22.502 --> 00:03:23.503 line:95%,end
Let's take the moms.

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:24.837 line:95%,end
No--

00:03:24.904 --> 00:03:26.172 line:95%,end
How are the lists
dividing up between who's

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.041 line:95%,end
on the naughty and nice list?
- --the moms are so rude.

00:03:28.107 --> 00:03:31.010 line:95%,end
They are conniving, they are cutthroat,

00:03:31.077 --> 00:03:33.179 line:95%,end
and they're teaching
that to their children.

00:03:33.246 --> 00:03:35.315 line:95%,end
Not even one of them on the nice list?

00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:36.883 line:95%,end
Mm, not really, no.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.051 line:95%,end
JEFF COLLINS: Wow.

00:03:38.117 --> 00:03:40.787 line:95%,end
They think that I'm the meanie.

00:03:40.853 --> 00:03:42.388 line:95%,end
Well, you know what?

00:03:42.455 --> 00:03:44.257 line:95%,end
I bought them all gifts this Christmas.

00:03:44.324 --> 00:03:45.525 line:95%,end
JEFF COLLINS: Wow.


00:03:45.592 --> 00:03:47.060 line:95%,end
I was very thoughtful.

00:03:47.126 --> 00:03:49.229 line:95%,end
I was courteous.

00:03:49.295 --> 00:03:52.131 line:95%,end
And I was giving and kind.

00:03:52.198 --> 00:03:55.068 line:95%,end
Well, you know, they say Christmas
is a time for forgiveness.

00:03:55.134 --> 00:03:57.470 line:95%,end
So it sounds like you're in
the forgiving-- not so fast?

00:03:57.537 --> 00:03:59.839 line:95%,end
- No, Jeff. I think you're pushing it.
- Not so fast?

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:01.975 line:95%,end
I don't think there's forgiveness at all.

00:04:02.041 --> 00:04:03.776 line:95%,end
I remember everything.

00:04:03.843 --> 00:04:07.146 line:95%,end
Well, I think this is really going to be
an interesting gift-giving session.

00:04:07.213 --> 00:04:09.048 line:95%,end
I can't wait to see what you thought up.

00:04:09.115 --> 00:04:11.150 line:95%,end
Just give me one little
hint about each mom

00:04:11.217 --> 00:04:12.585 line:95%,end
and why she's on the naughty list.

00:04:12.652 --> 00:04:16.589 line:95%,end
Well, you know, you have Christi,
whose mouth is out of control.

00:04:16.656 --> 00:04:20.326 line:95%,end
You have Melissa, who's naughty
all the time, inappropriately,

00:04:20.393 --> 00:04:21.995 line:95%,end
in front of the kids.

00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:26.332 line:95%,end
Then you have, you know, Kelly showing up
drunk at the dance studio.

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:27.567 line:95%,end
You can't do that.

00:04:27.634 --> 00:04:30.236 line:95%,end
And then you have Holly,
who does not

00:04:30.303 --> 00:04:35.275 line:95%,end
want to believe that Nia's feet can't be
fixed by reading a textbook.

00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:38.645 line:95%,end
And then you have Jill,
who still has crying Kendall.

00:04:38.711 --> 00:04:41.281 line:95%,end
You look at the kid
sideways, and the kid cries.

00:04:41.347 --> 00:04:43.950 line:95%,end
So all the mothers,
they're just bad mothers.

00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:45.451 line:95%,end
JEFF COLLINS: That
certainly gives us a hint.

00:04:45.518 --> 00:04:48.388 line:95%,end
I can't wait to see these
gifts that you've brought.

00:04:48.454 --> 00:04:50.957 line:95%,end
So let's get the moms out here.
Ladies, come on out.

00:04:51.024 --> 00:04:52.125 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:04:52.191 --> 00:04:53.359 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: Oh, my God.

00:04:53.426 --> 00:04:54.560 line:95%,end
Aw, thank you.

00:04:54.627 --> 00:04:55.795 line:95%,end
That's why I didn't want to wear red.

00:04:55.862 --> 00:04:56.963 line:95%,end
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.631 line:95%,end
Hello.
Hello, ladies.

00:04:58.698 --> 00:04:59.932 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: I like the red.

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:01.868 line:95%,end
JEFF COLLINS: Hello, hello, hello.

00:05:01.934 --> 00:05:03.970 line:95%,end
JILL VERTES: Oh, comfy.

00:05:04.037 --> 00:05:06.139 line:95%,end
All right. The first thing I want
to know is does everybody

00:05:06.205 --> 00:05:08.574 line:95%,end
celebrate Christmas,
because we don't know.

00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:09.742 line:95%,end
So yes, yes, yes?
- Yes.

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:11.611 line:95%,end
- Absolutely.
- Okay, fantastic.

00:05:11.678 --> 00:05:13.513 line:95%,end
So let's get to Abby's gifts.

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:16.115 line:95%,end
She brought gifts for all of you
that she picked out especially.

00:05:16.182 --> 00:05:17.517 line:95%,end
Wow.

00:05:17.583 --> 00:05:19.952 line:95%,end
I am giving.
I am kind. When I give someone a gift--

00:05:20.019 --> 00:05:22.722 line:95%,end
- Wow.
- --I like them to use it.

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:23.990 line:95%,end
The joy is in the giving.

00:05:24.057 --> 00:05:25.591 line:95%,end
Well, that's--
JEFF COLLINS: So these are--

00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:27.627 line:95%,end
--why I always gave
you a tray of cookies--

00:05:27.694 --> 00:05:29.295 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: Because you--
- --because you love cookies.

00:05:29.362 --> 00:05:31.331 line:95%,end
I know.

00:05:31.397 --> 00:05:33.633 line:95%,end
All right. Well, Abby, I'm excited,
and I want to see what you got.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.134 line:95%,end
So why don't you take it away?

00:05:35.201 --> 00:05:39.105 line:95%,end
[claps] Santa's little helper!

00:05:39.172 --> 00:05:40.206 line:95%,end
[music playing] (SINGING)
Fa, la, la, la, la.

00:05:40.273 --> 00:05:42.141 line:95%,end
HOLLY FRASIER: Oh, he
comes with a soundtrack.

00:05:42.208 --> 00:05:43.476 line:95%,end
[cheering]

00:05:45.244 --> 00:05:47.046 line:95%,end
Oh.

00:05:47.113 --> 00:05:48.581 line:95%,end
Thank you.

00:05:48.648 --> 00:05:50.249 line:95%,end
All right, come here.

00:05:50.316 --> 00:05:52.885 line:95%,end
We want kisses.
Mwah.

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:57.824 line:95%,end
Thank you. Bye!

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:58.958 line:95%,end
WOMEN: Bye!

00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:00.827 line:95%,end
Bye, little elf.

00:06:00.893 --> 00:06:02.795 line:95%,end
All right.
So let's get this party started.

00:13:58.137 --> 00:13:59.872 line:95%,end
You don't always like your sister,

00:13:59.939 --> 00:14:02.107 line:95%,end
but you always love them at
the end of the day, you know?

00:14:02.174 --> 00:14:04.510 line:95%,end
- And--
- But do you stab your sister in the back?

00:14:04.577 --> 00:14:05.878 line:95%,end
[gasping]

00:14:06.312 --> 00:14:08.013 line:95%,end
So when we're talking about sisters, Abby,

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.882 line:95%,end
which sister was Christi in the family?

00:14:09.949 --> 00:14:12.117 line:95%,end
If you want to get
beat with a wire hanger--

00:14:12.184 --> 00:14:13.519 line:95%,end
- Oh, okay.
- --she would be the mom.

00:14:13.586 --> 00:14:14.687 line:95%,end
JEFF COLLINS: Oh, OK.

00:14:14.753 --> 00:14:15.921 line:95%,end
CHRISTI LUKASIAK: No, I'm
pretty sure that's you, not me.

00:14:15.988 --> 00:14:17.156 line:95%,end
So she's "Mommy Dearest"?
CHRISTI LUKASIAK: Yeah, okay.

00:14:17.223 --> 00:14:18.624 line:95%,end
JEFF COLLINS: She's the "Mommy Dearest"?

00:14:18.691 --> 00:14:19.792 line:95%,end
All right, that's me.

00:14:19.859 --> 00:14:21.427 line:95%,end
I think there's a sister that
we haven't seen in a while,

00:14:21.493 --> 00:14:22.528 line:95%,end
and that's Cathy.

00:14:22.595 --> 00:14:24.496 line:95%,end
She's the ugly stepsister, Cathy.

00:14:24.563 --> 00:14:27.166 line:95%,end
No "Dance Mom" family would
be complete without Cathy.

00:14:27.233 --> 00:14:28.234 line:95%,end
Come on.
ABBY LEE MILLER: Yes.

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:29.869 line:95%,end
KELLY HYLAND: It could be!
- Yes.

00:14:29.935 --> 00:14:31.070 line:95%,end
It would all be very complete without her.

00:14:31.136 --> 00:14:33.172 line:95%,end
Cathy's gotten a lot of
criticism from all of you

00:14:33.239 --> 00:14:34.306 line:95%,end
over the years.

00:14:34.373 --> 00:14:37.109 line:95%,end
So Christi, who do you
think is the bigger Scrooge?

00:14:37.176 --> 00:14:39.011 line:95%,end
- Oh--
- Cathy or Abby?

00:14:39.078 --> 00:14:42.414 line:95%,end
I don't know. I think Abby and Cathy
are both kind of on par,

00:14:42.481 --> 00:14:45.684 line:95%,end
because I think that both of their hearts
could grow a few sizes.

00:14:45.751 --> 00:14:46.886 line:95%,end
- A few sizes?
CHRISTI LUKASIAK: Yeah.

00:14:46.952 --> 00:14:47.953 line:95%,end
Melissa, what do you think?

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:50.022 line:95%,end
Oh, I think Cathy, absolutely.

00:14:50.089 --> 00:14:51.790 line:95%,end
Well, look, I think we
should bring her out and hear

00:14:51.857 --> 00:14:53.058 line:95%,end
from her ourselves.
- Wow.

00:14:53.125 --> 00:14:54.460 line:95%,end
Let's bring out Cathy to join the party.

00:14:54.526 --> 00:14:57.062 line:95%,end
Please welcome Abby's
toughest rival, Cathy.

00:14:57.129 --> 00:14:58.564 line:95%,end
[applause]

00:14:59.765 --> 00:15:02.034 line:95%,end
[upbeat music]

00:15:02.101 --> 00:15:04.136 line:95%,end
All right.

00:15:05.371 --> 00:15:08.207 line:95%,end
Hello.
She's carry a present.

00:15:08.274 --> 00:15:10.109 line:95%,end
- Merry Christmas.
- How are you?

00:15:10.175 --> 00:15:11.911 line:95%,end
Merry Christmas.

00:15:11.977 --> 00:15:13.145 line:95%,end
Cathy came bearing a gift.

00:15:13.212 --> 00:15:14.546 line:95%,end
- I did.
JEFF COLLINS: Is this for Abby?

00:15:14.613 --> 00:15:15.648 line:95%,end
It is.

00:15:15.714 --> 00:15:17.216 line:95%,end
- This is a gift for you, Abby.
- Hi.

00:15:17.283 --> 00:15:18.617 line:95%,end
I'll keep it for later.

00:15:18.684 --> 00:15:19.752 line:95%,end
Should we-- I think we
should open it right away.

00:15:19.818 --> 00:15:21.253 line:95%,end
It's not ticking, is it?

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.421 line:95%,end
It is ticking, actually.

00:15:22.488 --> 00:15:23.822 line:95%,end
I've never seen it in my life.

00:15:23.889 --> 00:15:24.890 line:95%,end
HOLLY FRASIER: A pressure cooker?

00:15:24.957 --> 00:15:26.292 line:95%,end
You haven't been near a kitchen,

00:15:26.358 --> 00:15:27.493 line:95%,end
but I know what that is.
- Oh, it's for poached eggs?

00:15:27.559 --> 00:15:28.594 line:95%,end
KELLY HYLAND: Oh, it's a poaching set.

00:15:28.661 --> 00:15:29.929 line:95%,end
[yells]

00:15:29.995 --> 00:15:32.564 line:95%,end
All right. Well, some brunch when
we do Eggs Benedict--

00:15:32.631 --> 00:15:35.534 line:95%,end
Cathy, why would you buy
Abby a poa-- an egg poacher?

00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:39.605 line:95%,end
Well, you know, all last season,
I was criticized

00:15:39.672 --> 00:15:42.074 line:95%,end
while I was putting together
a fabulous team

00:15:42.141 --> 00:15:45.110 line:95%,end
and giving kids all over the countryside
opportunities.

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:46.545 line:95%,end
What opportunity?

00:15:46.612 --> 00:15:49.315 line:95%,end
So now I hear that there's
all these auditions that are

00:15:49.381 --> 00:15:51.583 line:95%,end
happening, poaching students.

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:53.953 line:95%,end
So I figured that that
would be perfect for her.

00:15:54.019 --> 00:15:56.722 line:95%,end
And sooner or later, she's going to end up
with egg on her face. Don't you think?


00:15:56.789 --> 00:15:59.558 line:95%,end
AUDIENCE: Oh!

00:15:59.625 --> 00:16:02.328 line:95%,end
Now, Cathy, you were backstage
when Abby was giving out

00:16:02.394 --> 00:16:04.363 line:95%,end
all her gifts to the moms, and you must--

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:05.631 line:95%,end
- Yes.
- --have been listening.

00:16:05.698 --> 00:16:07.533 line:95%,end
So what did you think about all the gifts
that Abby had to give out to all her moms?

00:16:07.599 --> 00:16:10.202 line:95%,end
Oh, my gosh.
I was mortified-- how mean.

00:16:10.269 --> 00:16:13.072 line:95%,end
Why do you moms take those type of gifts?
They were horrible.

00:16:13.138 --> 00:16:16.375 line:95%,end
If you were at Candy
Apples representing us,

00:16:16.442 --> 00:16:18.544 line:95%,end
you would have had Chanel tennis shoes--

00:16:19.845 --> 00:16:23.816 line:95%,end
good for track, good for running and
getting away from wicked people.

00:16:25.384 --> 00:16:27.987 line:95%,end
Kelly, I thought of the
perfect gift for you

00:16:28.087 --> 00:16:29.455 line:95%,end
that I would have gotten you.

00:16:29.521 --> 00:16:32.091 line:95%,end
It would have been a
lovely embroidered hankie

00:16:32.157 --> 00:16:34.326 line:95%,end
because, obviously,
I was provoked by Abby.

00:16:34.393 --> 00:16:35.995 line:95%,end
You're always crying.
- I know.

00:16:36.061 --> 00:16:37.763 line:95%,end
Yeah, and your soggy eyeballs
are really nerve-racking.

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:39.331 line:95%,end
AUDIENCE: Oh!

00:16:40.699 --> 00:16:42.001 line:95%,end
You know what I would get you?

00:16:42.101 --> 00:16:45.671 line:95%,end
I would get you a one-way ticket to LA

00:16:45.738 --> 00:16:47.139 line:95%,end
so that you wouldn't
come back, because I'm

00:16:47.206 --> 00:16:49.041 line:95%,end
really tired of seeing
Maddie front and center.

00:16:49.108 --> 00:16:50.976 line:95%,end
Because all of the other
girls are pushed to the back.

00:16:51.043 --> 00:16:52.644 line:95%,end
- Yeah.
JEFF COLLINS: Mm.

00:16:52.711 --> 00:16:54.380 line:95%,end
- Oh, Cathy, I can't wait.
- Christi--

00:16:54.446 --> 00:16:56.448 line:95%,end
CHRISTI LUKASIAK: You're like a little--
- Do you know what I would get you?

00:16:56.515 --> 00:16:57.516 line:95%,end
--Christmas spirit. What?

00:16:57.583 --> 00:16:59.318 line:95%,end
I would get you a get
out of jail free card.

00:16:59.385 --> 00:17:00.519 line:95%,end
Oh, I actually would take that.

00:17:00.619 --> 00:17:02.154 line:95%,end
[laughs] [claps]

00:17:02.221 --> 00:17:03.255 line:95%,end
And, Jill--

00:17:03.322 --> 00:17:04.356 line:95%,end
CHRISTI LUKASIAK: 'Cause you never know.

00:17:04.423 --> 00:17:06.158 line:95%,end
--I probably wouldn't buy Jill a gift.

00:17:07.059 --> 00:17:09.595 line:95%,end
I don't like-- I don't like Jill.
She knows it.

00:17:09.661 --> 00:17:11.497 line:95%,end
- She knows it.
CHRISTI LUKASIAK: That's very Christmas--

00:17:11.563 --> 00:17:13.165 line:95%,end
Cathy, you don't have this kind

00:17:13.232 --> 00:17:14.533 line:95%,end
of contentious relationship
with the moms at your studio?

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:15.934 line:95%,end
- Oh, my, no, no.
JEFF COLLINS: No?

00:17:16.001 --> 00:17:18.337 line:95%,end
What moms at her studio?
They're from everybody else's studio.

00:17:18.404 --> 00:17:20.205 line:95%,end
It just blows my mind.

00:17:20.272 --> 00:17:21.607 line:95%,end
I mean, let's face it.

00:17:21.673 --> 00:17:22.908 line:95%,end
You guys have a winning team.

00:17:22.975 --> 00:17:27.179 line:95%,end
Yet here she sits,
and she threatens all of you

00:17:27.246 --> 00:17:29.214 line:95%,end
that she's going to replace you.

00:17:29.281 --> 00:17:30.282 line:95%,end
Well, you might have to deal with it.

00:17:30.349 --> 00:17:31.617 line:95%,end
Yet she-- I'm not done
talking, and you're rude.

00:17:31.683 --> 00:17:32.851 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

00:17:32.918 --> 00:17:34.053 line:95%,end
Yet she--
- Cathy, you might have to do--

00:17:34.119 --> 00:17:35.187 line:95%,end
- Yet she wants--
- --that on your team--

00:17:35.254 --> 00:17:36.722 line:95%,end
- --to replace you guys.
- I don't have to do that.

00:17:36.822 --> 00:17:38.557 line:95%,end
CATHY NESBITT-STEIN: Well--
- I am trying to train dancers.

00:17:38.624 --> 00:17:39.958 line:95%,end
CATHY NESBITT-STEIN: Abby--

00:17:40.025 --> 00:17:42.027 line:95%,end
Go outside, walk up the
street, hit a Broadway show,

00:17:42.094 --> 00:17:43.495 line:95%,end
and see if your name's in the playbill.

00:17:43.562 --> 00:17:44.730 line:95%,end
Kelly--

00:17:44.797 --> 00:17:45.964 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: Maybe
I have a new studio opening.

00:17:46.031 --> 00:17:47.299 line:95%,end
--she's trying to replace Brooke.

00:17:47.366 --> 00:17:48.634 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: Maybe
I'm doing another show.

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:50.269 line:95%,end
- Why would she be doing that?
ABBY LEE MILLER: There's lots of things!

00:17:50.335 --> 00:17:52.337 line:95%,end
Why would she be trying to replace Brooke?
She talks about Christmas spirit.

00:17:52.404 --> 00:17:54.640 line:95%,end
You want to know who
the biggest Scrooge is?

00:17:54.706 --> 00:17:58.310 line:95%,end
She's sitting in the throne,
and it's not because she's a queen.

00:17:58.377 --> 00:17:59.912 line:95%,end
There's other thrones.

00:18:01.113 --> 00:18:02.481 line:95%,end
It is true, Abby.

00:18:02.548 --> 00:18:06.085 line:95%,end
I mean, you're trying to replace
a team that wins for you.

00:18:06.151 --> 00:18:09.154 line:95%,end
And the girls on your team,
with the exception of Kendall,

00:18:09.221 --> 00:18:11.290 line:95%,end
have been there since they were babies.

00:18:11.356 --> 00:18:12.691 line:95%,end
So stand behind your work.

00:18:12.758 --> 00:18:17.096 line:95%,end
Did you ever think that I
want your child, in particular,

00:18:17.162 --> 00:18:20.232 line:95%,end
to be challenged, all of
the kids to be challenged?

00:18:20.299 --> 00:18:23.102 line:95%,end
You say all the time
you want the girls to win.

00:18:23.168 --> 00:18:25.471 line:95%,end
They deliver wins.
What more do you want?

00:18:25.537 --> 00:18:28.807 line:95%,end
I want them to be the
best they can be, Christi.

00:18:28.874 --> 00:18:31.076 line:95%,end
That's not going out
and getting a new kid.

00:18:31.143 --> 00:18:33.846 line:95%,end
That's helping these kids
be the best they can be.

00:18:33.912 --> 00:18:34.947 line:95%,end
Well, I have a question.

00:18:35.013 --> 00:18:37.116 line:95%,end
Your team wins.

00:18:37.182 --> 00:18:38.417 line:95%,end
What is it that you want?

00:18:38.484 --> 00:18:39.985 line:95%,end
I want them to be the best they can be.

00:18:40.052 --> 00:18:41.186 line:95%,end
Okay, but obviously they are.
ABBY LEE MILLER: I don't want--

00:18:41.253 --> 00:18:42.621 line:95%,end
Or are you saying that your--

00:18:42.688 --> 00:18:43.755 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: --the
costume and the headpiece

00:18:43.822 --> 00:18:45.057 line:95%,end
to make them win.

00:18:45.124 --> 00:18:46.859 line:95%,end
Or are you saying that your
teams are given the wins?

00:18:46.925 --> 00:18:49.328 line:95%,end
- How dare you!
- Oh, I know. How dare me.

00:18:49.394 --> 00:18:50.863 line:95%,end
- How dare you--
CATHY NESBITT-STEIN: Oh, why?

00:18:50.929 --> 00:18:52.264 line:95%,end
- Because--
- --insinuate--

00:18:52.331 --> 00:18:53.398 line:95%,end
CATHY NESBITT-STEIN: Why?
Because I'm putting something--

00:18:53.465 --> 00:18:54.466 line:95%,end
- --that I cheat or the competition--
CATHY NESBITT-STEIN: --on the line?

00:18:54.533 --> 00:18:55.567 line:95%,end
CATHY NESBITT-STEIN: How--
- Oh, honey.

00:18:55.634 --> 00:18:57.336 line:95%,end
- Oh, you just the crossed the line!
CATHY NESBITT-STEIN: How--

00:18:57.402 --> 00:19:00.672 line:95%,end
Well, that won't be the first time, honey.
And I don't have my purse out here either.

00:19:00.739 --> 00:19:02.741 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: Yeah.
- Well, one thing's for sure.

00:19:02.808 --> 00:19:05.644 line:95%,end
It wouldn't be a "Dance Moms" Christmas
without a little confrontation.

00:19:06.979 --> 00:19:09.181 line:95%,end
Well, Cathy, I know you have
a big surprise for us coming

00:19:09.248 --> 00:19:10.382 line:95%,end
up later.
- I do.

00:19:10.449 --> 00:19:11.650 line:95%,end
JEFF COLLINS: Tell me what you brought.
- I do.

00:19:11.717 --> 00:19:15.621 line:95%,end
Well, you know, we have lots
of seniors at our studio.

00:19:16.922 --> 00:19:20.559 line:95%,end
And so I brought some
seniors to entertain.

00:19:20.659 --> 00:19:21.960 line:95%,end
Yes?

00:19:22.027 --> 00:19:23.262 line:95%,end
And they're going to do
a little Christmas piece.

00:19:23.328 --> 00:19:25.731 line:95%,end
And they've had a lot of fun doing it.

such a great senior team.

00:19:29.234 --> 00:19:32.104 line:95%,end
I understand that you
have a smaller senior team

00:19:32.171 --> 00:19:33.539 line:95%,end
now that it's kind of dwindled.

00:19:33.605 --> 00:19:34.640 line:95%,end
Want to tell me about that?

00:19:34.706 --> 00:19:36.241 line:95%,end
Well, a lot of the kids graduate.

00:19:36.308 --> 00:19:38.143 line:95%,end
We had six graduates last year.
- Oh, yeah.

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:40.412 line:95%,end
Well, graduates always happen,
but you have to replenish.

Well, I think my senior
team is in "Newsies" and--

No, I have three.

- All right.

00:19:48.687 --> 00:19:50.255 line:95%,end
Well, it sounds like the
rivalry is continuing.

00:19:50.322 --> 00:19:52.124 line:95%,end
We're going to find out if
Cathy's senior team lives up

00:19:52.191 --> 00:19:54.226 line:95%,end
to Abby's standards in just a moment.

00:19:54.293 --> 00:19:58.230 line:95%,end

going to hear from some of our dance dads.

on the Christmas tree.

00:20:13.345 --> 00:20:15.447 line:95%,end
And I was, of course, standing
on the back of a chair.

00:20:15.514 --> 00:20:17.416 line:95%,end
And it flipped over, and
I cracked my head open

and spent Christmas Eve in the hospital.

00:20:19.651 --> 00:20:21.420 line:95%,end
You like our Christmas breakfast.

00:20:21.486 --> 00:20:23.855 line:95%,end
Yes, only when I make it.

00:20:23.922 --> 00:20:26.291 line:95%,end
No, honey.
I make it.

That warmed the cockles of my heart.

As far as the lying and cheating,

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:44.182 line:95%,end
you need to be a little bit more specific.

00:24:44.249 --> 00:24:46.351 line:95%,end
But--
- Lying about children's ages.

00:24:46.418 --> 00:24:48.253 line:95%,end
But I think that the
only thing that was truly

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:53.225 line:95%,end
said that was real was that it's funny
that we were friends at one time.

shove, you haven't an ounce.

I want to share my big wish

May your embroidered Abby Lee Dance
Company shirt size decrease.

May Santa bring you a man
to take one for the team,

00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:34.693 line:95%,end
so your ass settles down
and you stop being so mean.

00:26:36.494 --> 00:26:40.532 line:95%,end
To Cathy, I hope Candy
Apples turn things around.

00:26:41.499 --> 00:26:44.703 line:95%,end
I don't think it's quite possible
you could go further down.

[laughs]

00:26:46.137 --> 00:26:49.207 line:95%,end
So may Santa bring you
a competitive advantage

00:26:49.274 --> 00:26:53.144 line:95%,end
and hope you correct all
the things you mismanage.

00:26:53.211 --> 00:26:55.313 line:95%,end
To both of you, I wish
a very happy holiday.

00:26:56.181 --> 00:26:59.951 line:95%,end
And may Santa Claus bless you
in every possible way.

no screams or yells, you know.

Well, if tonight is any
indication of Christmas,

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:34.753 line:95%,end
we know that it can either
bring people closer together

00:27:34.819 --> 00:27:36.488 line:95%,end
or sometimes push them further apart.

But I want to know, in
terms of the dance dads,

00:27:39.391 --> 00:27:42.260 line:95%,end
what should their role be when they
have a daughter who's in Abby Lee?

00:27:42.327 --> 00:27:46.965 line:95%,end
Whether or not they like the dancing,

00:27:47.032 --> 00:27:48.800 line:95%,end
it's what their children like.

00:27:48.867 --> 00:27:50.935 line:95%,end
It's what their kids have
decided to do with their lives.

00:27:51.002 --> 00:27:54.572 line:95%,end
No Christmas is complete
about the entire family.

00:27:54.639 --> 00:27:56.908 line:95%,end
So right now, I want to
bring out the dance dads,

00:27:56.975 --> 00:27:58.309 line:95%,end
because I want to hear from them.

00:27:58.376 --> 00:27:59.711 line:95%,end
So dads--

00:27:59.778 --> 00:28:01.179 line:95%,end
[festive music]

00:28:01.746 --> 00:28:02.781 line:95%,end
How are you? I'm Jeff.

00:28:02.847 --> 00:28:04.683 line:95%,end
- Hi, Jeff. Erno.
- Hi, Erno. How are you?

00:28:04.749 --> 00:28:05.817 line:95%,end
- Nice to meet you.
- Have a seat.

00:28:05.884 --> 00:28:06.885 line:95%,end
- Hi.
- Hey, how are you?

00:28:06.951 --> 00:28:08.253 line:95%,end
- Good too meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

00:28:08.319 --> 00:28:09.554 line:95%,end
Yeah, for sure. Nice to see you.

00:28:09.621 --> 00:28:11.489 line:95%,end
EVAN FRASIER: Evan.
- Hey.

00:28:11.923 --> 00:28:13.458 line:95%,end
Let's do some quick introductions.

00:28:13.525 --> 00:28:18.263 line:95%,end
With us, we have Evan, who is
Holly's husband, dad to Nia,

00:28:18.329 --> 00:28:21.966 line:95%,end
and we have Erno, who's Jill's
husband and Kendall's father.

00:28:22.033 --> 00:28:23.234 line:95%,end
Welcome, gentlemen.

00:28:23.301 --> 00:28:26.004 line:95%,end
So Erno, it's great that you
were able to take some time

00:28:26.071 --> 00:28:28.673 line:95%,end
and be with your family here
in Manhattan for the holidays.

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:30.041 line:95%,end
I'm so glad that you guys invited us.

00:28:30.108 --> 00:28:31.576 line:95%,end
How is it being a dance dad?

00:28:31.643 --> 00:28:33.178 line:95%,end
It's tough.

00:28:33.244 --> 00:28:36.548 line:95%,end
I don't have my wife and my youngest
daughter around very much.

00:28:36.614 --> 00:28:38.750 line:95%,end
When you watch Kendall, is there anything

00:28:38.817 --> 00:28:40.018 line:95%,end
that you don't like--
- Yes.

00:28:40.085 --> 00:28:41.119 line:95%,end
JEFF COLLINS: --about the way-- what?

00:28:41.186 --> 00:28:43.555 line:95%,end
Yeah, it's really hard to watch the show

00:28:43.621 --> 00:28:45.490 line:95%,end
when your daughter is crying.

00:28:45.557 --> 00:28:47.392 line:95%,end
AUDIENCE: Aw.

00:28:47.459 --> 00:28:50.028 line:95%,end
So Evan, how about you?
How do you feel?

00:28:50.095 --> 00:28:52.931 line:95%,end
It has been a really
amazing experience for Nia.

00:28:52.997 --> 00:28:56.034 line:95%,end
I have seen the way she
has grown over the years.

00:28:56.101 --> 00:28:58.036 line:95%,end
There's some tough moments in there.

00:28:58.103 --> 00:29:02.040 line:95%,end
But, you know, to see her
thriving, it's really amazing.

00:29:02.107 --> 00:29:05.610 line:95%,end
But how do you feel about Abby?
Do you have any constructive criticism?

00:29:05.677 --> 00:29:07.045 line:95%,end
[laughs]

00:29:08.213 --> 00:29:12.183 line:95%,end
She's a little tough love at times.

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:13.384 line:95%,end
There's no question about it.

00:29:13.451 --> 00:29:16.221 line:95%,end
And so there are some times
I want to reach through the TV,

00:29:16.287 --> 00:29:20.825 line:95%,end
but, overall, it's been a
tremendous experience for Nia.

00:29:20.892 --> 00:29:23.695 line:95%,end
And for me, that's the
most important thing.

00:29:23.762 --> 00:29:26.898 line:95%,end
Abby, isn't it nice to have some of
the dads here join us for the holidays?

00:29:26.965 --> 00:29:31.002 line:95%,end
Yes. But I find it odd that there's
seven kids on the team,

00:29:31.069 --> 00:29:32.170 line:95%,end
and I have two dads here.

00:29:32.237 --> 00:29:33.438 line:95%,end
AUDIENCE: Oh!

00:29:33.505 --> 00:29:36.007 line:95%,end
I just feel that the
dads should take, you know,

00:29:36.074 --> 00:29:38.376 line:95%,end
an interest in it, even
if they don't care.

00:29:38.443 --> 00:29:39.677 line:95%,end
Pretend.

00:29:39.744 --> 00:29:41.479 line:95%,end
Like Christi's husband--
I think the last time

00:29:41.546 --> 00:29:44.082 line:95%,end
I saw Chloe's dad was when he came

00:29:44.149 --> 00:29:47.652 line:95%,end
in for a meeting in my studio
with Christi to find out

00:29:47.719 --> 00:29:49.487 line:95%,end
why Maddie got more privates.

00:29:49.554 --> 00:29:51.289 line:95%,end
And then he really
didn't want to be there.

00:29:51.356 --> 00:29:52.690 line:95%,end
He could have cared less.

00:29:52.757 --> 00:29:54.692 line:95%,end
You're rude to him. So--

00:29:54.759 --> 00:29:57.095 line:95%,end
I'm not rude to him at all.
He hasn't built a prop.

00:29:57.162 --> 00:29:59.130 line:95%,end
He hasn't done anything--

00:29:59.197 --> 00:30:00.231 line:95%,end
- You've never asked, Abby.
- --at the studio.

00:30:00.298 --> 00:30:02.066 line:95%,end
He's never b--
I shouldn't have to ask.

00:30:02.133 --> 00:30:03.401 line:95%,end
He should offer.

00:30:03.468 --> 00:30:04.702 line:95%,end
Oh, he should just know by
osmosis that you need, like--

00:30:04.769 --> 00:30:06.237 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: No.
- --a sled built?

00:30:06.304 --> 00:30:08.406 line:95%,end
He should come and
say, hey, my kid won this

00:30:08.473 --> 00:30:10.809 line:95%,end
or my kid won that.
Is there anything you need done, Abby?

00:30:10.875 --> 00:30:12.177 line:95%,end
CHRISTI LUKASIAK: Well--
- Can I help out in any way?

00:30:12.243 --> 00:30:13.778 line:95%,end
--you know what?
My husband's involved in other ways.

00:30:13.845 --> 00:30:15.079 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: He has seen other dads.

00:30:15.146 --> 00:30:16.214 line:95%,end
That's--

00:30:16.281 --> 00:30:17.415 line:95%,end
ABBY LEE MILLER: He's seen
dads that say prop dads

00:30:17.482 --> 00:30:18.850 line:95%,end
on their backs. He's been to competitions.

00:30:18.917 --> 00:30:20.084 line:95%,end
- You've never had a--
ABBY LEE MILLER: Oh!

00:30:20.151 --> 00:30:21.352 line:95%,end
--dad with a t-shirt that said prop dad.

00:30:21.419 --> 00:30:22.687 line:95%,end
- You're making that up.
ABBY LEE MILLER: Yes, we did. Yes, we did.

00:30:22.754 --> 00:30:23.988 line:95%,end
CHRISTI LUKASIAK: Okay,
maybe before Chloe danced

00:30:24.055 --> 00:30:25.423 line:95%,end
- at your studio--
ABBY LEE MILLER: Correct.

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:27.458 line:95%,end
--but certainly not
during my tenure there.

00:30:27.525 --> 00:30:29.027 line:95%,end
He hasn't seen them at
all the other competitions?

00:30:29.093 --> 00:30:32.197 line:95%,end
Because you don't have fathers that wear
shirts that say prop dad.

00:30:32.263 --> 00:30:33.731 line:95%,end
Has anyone ever seen that?
Thank you.

00:30:33.832 --> 00:30:35.967 line:95%,end
No. Usually they wear suits
and come and say, hello--

00:30:36.034 --> 00:30:37.302 line:95%,end
CHRISTI LUKASIAK: And my husband--
- --how are you?

00:30:37.368 --> 00:30:39.370 line:95%,end
--wears a suit and tie every day of his
life to work. Thank you.

00:30:39.437 --> 00:30:41.239 line:95%,end
So tell me what prop what he built again.

00:30:41.306 --> 00:30:44.876 line:95%,end
He doesn't need to build a prop.
He's supportive of his children at home.

00:30:44.943 --> 00:30:46.911 line:95%,end
Well, maybe it would be nice
for Chloe to come out on stage

00:30:47.011 --> 00:30:48.146 line:95%,end
and have her daddy there.

00:30:48.213 --> 00:30:49.614 line:95%,end
- Her daddy is there at times--
- I've never--


00:30:49.681 --> 00:30:50.849 line:95%,end
CHRISTI LUKASIAK: --when
her daddy can be there.

00:30:50.915 --> 00:30:52.016 line:95%,end
--ever seen him.

00:30:52.083 --> 00:30:53.151 line:95%,end
Because he makes sure everything at home

00:30:53.218 --> 00:30:56.054 line:95%,end
is perfectly okay
so Chloe can do the things

00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:58.256 line:95%,end
that she wants to do, because
her mother is with her.

00:30:58.356 --> 00:30:59.958 line:95%,end
AUDIENCE: Oh!

00:31:00.024 --> 00:31:02.627 line:95%,end
All right. Well, thank you so much, Erno
and Evan, for coming today.

00:31:02.694 --> 00:31:04.028 line:95%,end
Happy holidays to you guys.

00:31:04.095 --> 00:31:05.463 line:95%,end
I hope you get some time
to spend with your families

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:06.698 line:95%,end
over the Christmas holidays.

00:31:06.764 --> 00:31:09.133 line:95%,end
All right, it's time for our
very special guest performance.

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.469 line:95%,end
Actor and recording
artist Coco Jones is here

00:31:11.536 --> 00:31:13.171 line:95%,end
to sing "Good To Be Home."

00:31:13.238 --> 00:31:15.773 line:95%,end
[cheering]

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:18.309 line:95%,end
[MUSIC - COCO JONES, "GOOD TO BE HOME"]

00:31:20.178 --> 00:31:23.281 line:5%,start
(SINGING) Oh, yeah.

00:31:23.348 --> 00:31:27.185 line:95%,end
Oh, yeah.

00:31:27.252 --> 00:31:34.092 line:95%,end
With reverence, I enter into
this holy place, a home that's

00:31:34.158 --> 00:31:39.130 line:95%,end
like no other, full of
mercy, love, and grace.

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:42.500 line:95%,end
I know it's been a long time.

00:31:42.567 --> 00:31:48.039 line:95%,end
I've never felt that far, 'cause
you were always on my mind,

00:31:48.106 --> 00:31:50.441 line:95%,end
and you were always in my heart.

00:31:50.508 --> 00:31:54.979 line:95%,end
It's so good to be home, where I know

00:31:55.079 --> 00:32:00.385 line:95%,end
that I belong, inside this house of love

00:32:00.451 --> 00:32:03.087 line:95%,end
with a family so strong.

00:32:03.154 --> 00:32:09.327 line:95%,end
And I'm here to worship
and pour out my offering.

00:32:09.394 --> 00:32:14.165 line:95%,end
In the presence of his
love, I'm never alone.

00:32:14.232 --> 00:32:15.833 line:95%,end
It's so good to be--

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:17.568 line:95%,end
Home, home.

00:32:17.635 --> 00:32:19.203 line:95%,end
--home, yeah.

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:20.772 line:95%,end
Home, sweet home.

00:32:20.838 --> 00:32:22.840 line:95%,end
So good to be home.

00:32:22.907 --> 00:32:24.409 line:95%,end
Home, home.

00:32:24.475 --> 00:32:25.543 line:95%,end
Yeah.

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:27.779 line:95%,end
Home, sweet home.

00:32:27.845 --> 00:32:34.185 line:95%,end
I know I'm always welcome
into these open arms.

00:32:34.285 --> 00:32:40.024 line:95%,end
When all of us are gathered,
it shines a light into the dark.

00:32:40.091 --> 00:32:43.761 line:95%,end
This home is where my
heart is, and it's always

00:32:43.828 --> 00:32:48.900 line:95%,end
been that way, because
you're forever by my side,

00:32:48.967 --> 00:32:52.870 line:95%,end
and now I know I'm here to stay.

00:32:52.937 --> 00:32:54.739 line:95%,end
So good to be home.

00:32:54.806 --> 00:33:01.346 line:95%,end
Where I know that I belong,
inside this house of love

with a family so strong.

00:33:03.982 --> 00:33:10.254 line:95%,end
And I'm here to worship
and pour out my offering.

In the presence of his love,
I'm never alone.

It's so good to be--

00:33:17.595 --> 00:33:18.730 line:95%,end
Home, home.

So good to be home.

00:33:23.167 --> 00:33:24.702 line:95%,end
Home, home.

00:33:24.769 --> 00:33:25.903 line:95%,end
Yeah.

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:28.406 line:95%,end

The amazing Coco Jones just performed.

00:33:37.015 --> 00:33:39.550 line:95%,end
And now it's that moment, the
one we've all been waiting for.

00:33:39.617 --> 00:33:41.486 line:95%,end
As far as I'm concerned,
it's not Christmas

00:33:41.552 --> 00:33:44.188 line:95%,end
until these kids get a whole
bunch of presents, right?

00:33:44.255 --> 00:33:46.290 line:95%,end
Well, let's get them out here.

00:33:46.357 --> 00:33:47.625 line:95%,end
Girls, come on out.

00:33:47.692 --> 00:33:49.794 line:95%,end
[festive music]

00:33:50.728 --> 00:33:51.829 line:95%,end
Come on.

00:33:51.896 --> 00:33:53.264 line:95%,end
Are you guys ready to get some loot?

00:33:53.331 --> 00:33:54.332 line:95%,end
ALL: Yes.

00:33:54.399 --> 00:33:55.700 line:95%,end
You are?

00:33:55.767 --> 00:33:58.936 line:95%,end
I just got word that Santa had a last
minute emergency, and he couldn't make it.

00:33:59.003 --> 00:34:00.204 line:95%,end
AUDIENCE: Oh!

00:34:00.271 --> 00:34:01.372 line:95%,end
ALL: Aw.

00:34:01.439 --> 00:34:02.573 line:95%,end
But he sent a helper.

00:34:03.207 --> 00:34:05.309 line:95%,end
Santa's helper looks familiar--

00:34:05.376 --> 00:34:07.211 line:95%,end
very nice, very nice.


00:34:08.813 --> 00:34:11.849 line:95%,end
It's been an amazing year for all of us,
with plenty of ups and downs.

00:34:11.916 --> 00:34:14.552 line:95%,end
And now it's time to celebrate
the holidays with Christmas

00:34:14.619 --> 00:34:16.220 line:95%,end
gifts for all the kids.

00:34:16.287 --> 00:34:18.856 line:95%,end
Christmas, for me, is about giving.

00:34:18.923 --> 00:34:21.059 line:95%,end
I receive joy in giving to others.

00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:24.295 line:95%,end
So I am excited. Let's go. Let's go.

00:34:24.362 --> 00:34:26.597 line:95%,end
All right.
So girls, go hang out over there.

00:34:26.664 --> 00:34:28.266 line:95%,end
And we're going to call you one

I would just have you
help me open this gift.
